Following our prepared remarks, we will turn the call over for your questions. A copy of our press release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and a replay of this conference call will be available in the investor relations section of our website at caesars.com.

Lastly, as a reminder, please note that Caesars Entertainment Corporation is primarily comprised of three operating structures, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company (CEOC), which consists of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas as well as a majority of Caesars regional properties; Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties (CERP), which includes six casino properties, predominately in Las Vegas, the LINQ and High Roller and the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace; and Caesars Growth Partners (CGP), a joint venture with Caesars Acquisition Company, which owns CIE, Planet Hollywood, The Quad, The Cromwell and Bally\u2019s Las Vegas as well as a 41% interest in Horseshoe Baltimore. CGP is a consolidated variable interest structure in which Caesars Entertainment holds nonvoting units. As we move forward with this call, the words Company, Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our, and us refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its controlled entities, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. Now before I hand it off to Gary Loveman I wanted to call your attention to a typo in the earnings release. At the bottom of page six, in the recent development section, we noted that all of our 10% second priority notes due 2018 will be tendered and it should be 2015. Gary? Gary Loveman : I can see why that might have caused some confusion Eric. Thank you for clarifying that. Good afternoon everyone. The early months of 2014 have seen great strides in our strategies to improve our Las Vegas hospitality offerings, enhance our distribution network and improve the company\u2019s financial condition. In Las Vegas, we opened or are about to open several new assets that have been under development for some time and were encouraged by a strong first quarter performance there. Caesars Interactive Entertainment experienced impressive growth as you heard this morning, and Caesars Entertainment received preliminary approval to develop a casino resort in South Korea. Concurrently, we have adjusted our capacity to existing demand in an oversupplied markets and worked aggressively to create stability and improve CEOC\u2019s capital structure. Indeed it's been a very busy agenda in that regard and before I cover the quarter\u2019s performance and highlights, I would like to review yesterday\u2019s announcement about efforts designed to prepare CEOC for deleveraging and provide the subsidiary with the flexibility it needs to execute its business plan.  While this process is anticipated to take some time, the actions CEOC is undertaking lay the foundation for significant improvement. The steps we have taken reflect our singular motivation to restore the financial health of CEOC. I am confident that these actions and those we announced yesterday are in the best long-term interest of the enterprise, its employees and the communities in which we operate. Now, on to the specifics of our announcements, CEOC launched a $1.75 billion incremental term loan and the associated refinancing of all 2015 maturities. Caesars Entertainment sold 5% of CEOC equity to a group of institutional investors, and agreed to pursue a listing of CEOC equity. CEOC launched a credit facility amendment and CEOC completed the sale of three Las Vegas properties to Caesars Growth Partners. Upon successful completion of these transactions, CEOC will have no material maturities until 2016. CEOC will have taken steps towards creating an equity currency that may be used in liability management or to aid in the reduction of debt; and CEOC will have added headroom under its maintenance covenant. Additionally, now that CEOC is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment, the Caesars Entertainment guarantee of CEOC\u2019s bonds has been released in accordance with the terms of the bond indentures. The full complement of financial and operational actions taken to date have led to the creation of substantial value in two stable structures, Caesars Growth Partners and Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties. Further, the formation of Caesars Growth Partners provides a platform to invest in new opportunities. Caesars Entertainment benefits from Growth Partners\u2019 new projects as a result of its 58% economic stake in Growth Partners, its receipt of management fees and the participation of Growth Partners\u2019 assets in the Total Rewards network. With these measures completed or underway, our attention is now focused on improving CEOC\u2019s financial condition. As was discussed on the Caesars Acquisition Company conference call this morning, the previously announced sale of The Quad Resort & Casino, Bally\u2019s Las Vegas and The Cromwell to Growth Partners was completed earlier this week, following the receipt of approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission. The sale of Harrah\u2019s New Orleans by CEOC to Growth Partners is expected to close in the second quarter, following approval by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. Upon completion of the sale, CEOC will have more than $3 billion in cash. On the last Caesars Entertainment conference call, we reported on our plans to establish a joint venture among Growth Partners, CERP, and CEOC to provide centralized services to properties in each of our structures. While we\u2019re still working on the details of the joint venture, I wanted to emphasize an important point; Services Co. will be a cash flow neutral entity. All of its costs will be allocated to properties based on their use of the services. As we work through additional details, we will provide additional information. Now, moving on to our results and developments. We had a strong quarter in Las Vegas, which benefited from exceptional demand in the group, international and FIT businesses. On the interactive side, CIE performed extremely well in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in social and mobile games. Our colleague Mitch Garber covered CIE\u2019s results in detail earlier today on the Caesars Acquisition Company earnings call. These encouraging performances were offset by weaker numbers in the Atlantic Coast region and the Midwest, both of which were negatively impacted by poor weather and weak visitation or trip patterns. At the end of March, CEOC announced the difficult decision to close Harrah\u2019s Tunica. The market around Tunica is saturated and has been in decline for many years. I am confident the combined impact of these initiatives will improve performance across our footprint. I might add I think it's such an important precedent for the notion that these markets can reach points where no new supply is indeed the right answer and in some cases reducing supply is the right answer. We continuously evaluate the supply and demand in all of our markets that are committed to adjusting capacity and investment to address market conditions. I will now turn to our strategic investments. For the past several years, we have been prioritizing the enhancement of our hospitality offerings in Las Vegas to meet customers\u2019 evolving preferences. Recall, all three Caesars structures, CEOC, CERP and Growth Partners, have exposure to the Las Vegas market and share in the benefits associated with these investments.  The LINQ and the High Roller, which are owned by CERP, epitomize our innovative investment in hospitality and the enhancement of available offerings in Vegas. Combined with the opening later this month of The Cromwell and the renovation of The Quad, the previously completed overhaul of the Jubilee Tower at Bally\u2019s and the new Axis Theater at Planet Hollywood, Caesars\u2019 properties on the East side of the Strip will have been completely redefined and upgraded. I am confident the combined impact of these initiatives will improve performance across our footprint. Since opening our High Roller at the end of March, surrounding properties are already experiencing increased traffic and visitation. I am optimistic this dynamic will continue to play itself out in the coming months. Consider a few specifics, the High Roller has received rave reviews from media outlets around the world and has welcomed thousands of riders a day in the early weeks of operation. Last month, the Academy of Country Music hosted its Party for a Cause celebration at The LINQ\u2019s festival space, which is just to the East of the High Roller, accommodating tens of thousands of visitors. Many of these guests later rolled on the High Roller and passed through the retail, dining and entertainment corridor. The space behind the High Roller has great potential to host events and attract more people to the center of the Strip in our neighborhood.  Next door, renovation work on The Quad, now owned by Growth Partners, has begun. As Mitch discussed earlier today, The Quad occupies an important position at the entrance to The LINQ. With the opening of The LINQ and High Roller, The Quad has already experienced improved volumes. I am optimistic the renovation will boost ADR and gaming revenue there. At The Cromwell, also now part of Growth Partners, the gaming floor opened in late April. On its first Saturday, the property generated more coin in than on any day since 2007 despite the fact the hotel, restaurants and other amenities have not yet opened. The property will celebrate its grand opening in a few weeks and we look forward to unveiling the boutique, lifestyle hotel as well as Giada De Laurentiis\u2019 eponymous restaurant and Drai\u2019s rooftop pool and night club.  Advance bookings are strong, and we are excited about the addition of this unique property to the Strip. As all three operating structures work to diversify and expand their customer base, hospitality initiatives play a pivotal role in Vegas and throughout our network. I am very pleased to welcome Bob Morse to our company as our new President of Hospitality. Bob has extensive experience in the industry, despite his youth, most recently serving as Chief Operating Officer of the Americas region for InterContinental Hotels Group. Earlier today, Asia Miles announced its new partnership with Caesars Entertainment. Asia Miles is one of the largest travel loyalty programs in Asia with some 6 million members. The alliance builds on the strategy to expand our reach and relevance to more customers and align our offerings with leading brands and loyalty programs around the world. The integration of our loyalty efforts with other industry-leading programs offers a rich source of customer acquisition and visitation. The Play by Total Rewards mobile app has received positive feedback from consumers since its launch last year. The latest version provides guests with more opportunities to facilitate their experiences with Caesars-branded properties on mobile devices, including booking hotel stays and accessing Total Rewards accounts from both iOS and Android devices.   In addition to the investments in hospitality and marketing I have described, our operating subsidiaries have expanded the company\u2019s distribution network in recent years with the opening of several new properties. In the third quarter, Horseshoe Baltimore will celebrate its grand opening. Recall, Growth Partners owns a 41% equity stake in the Baltimore project. Late last month, we announced our intent to pursue a license to develop a resort casino in Woodbury, New York in Orange County. Woodbury is ideally situated for the proposed development given its proximity to New York City, transportation and attractions that already drive high volume such as Woodbury Commons Premium Outlets. We are collaborating with David Flaum, a local developer, on the proposed project and will work together to secure the required permits and approvals. Also, with respect to the development pipeline, the government of South Korea announced in mid-March that Lippo and Caesars Entertainment Corporation have received preliminary approval to operate a jointly owned foreigners-only casino in Incheon, South Korea near the airport. The receipt of preliminary approval is an exciting development for Caesars. The project presents a promising opportunity to expand our brand and network into Asia in a high growth area with substantial and growing Chinese visitation. The consortium\u2019s plan includes a casino, hotels and resort amenities, live entertainment venues and a standalone convention center. If all goes as planned, we hope to open the resort in time to welcome visitors to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Caesars may elect to include Growth Partners in the development of both the New York and South Korea projects. In that event, it is anticipated that Growth Partners would make the capital investments.  Let me now turn it over to Donald Colvin to review financial performance in the first quarter. Donald Colvin : Thank you, Gary. At a high level, I will briefly review the drivers of performance for the three structures that consolidate into Caesars Entertainment, CERP, Growth Partners and CEOC. Starting off with CERP, Q1 net revenue increased 2% from the prior year period to $492 million and adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% to $113 million. CERP\u2019s concentration in the Las Vegas market was a key driver of performance. Casino revenues were down moderately in Las Vegas offset by strength in hospitality revenue.  At Growth Partners, Q1 performance was driven by strong growth in social and mobile games and favorable results across all key gaming and non-gaming offerings at Planet Hollywood. Detailed information on CGP\u2019s first quarter financial results can be found in the earnings release issued by Caesars Acquisition Company earlier today. Moving on to CEOC, net revenue was $1.4 billion in the first quarter, down approximately 11% from the prior year. CEOC adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately 25% to $250 million. Performance at CEOC was impacted by poor weather predominately in the Atlantic Coast region, the Gulf region and the Midwest. The softness in visitation levels was largely from the regional non-VIP guests.  Increased variable marketing costs and unfavorable hold also weighed on performance. On a consolidated basis, first quarter net revenue declined approximately 2% from the year ago period as lower casino revenue and higher variable marketing programs, which are a contra-revenue, were partially offset by higher hospitality revenue and strength in social and mobile games at CIE. On the expense side, costs were elevated due to increased marketing expenses and higher corporate costs. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 10%. Net revenue in Las Vegas increased approximately 6% due to strength in hotel, F&B and entertainment revenue. Hotel revenue was particularly strong with quarterly cash ADR of $121, up approximately 27% year-over-year, driven predominately by resort fees and outstanding demand for convention facilities in the Las Vegas market. Atlantic Coast net revenue decreased approximately 14% driven by lower casino revenues, predominately attributable to the weather impact and reduced visitation trends discussed earlier. CEOC also saw softness in the Gulf Coast. Other U.S. regions decreased 7% in net revenues.  We are committed to driving efficiency, improving working capital, generating operating and EBITDA improvements, and further enhancing our balance sheet, with a particular focus on CEOC\u2019s capital structure. In early April, Caesars Entertainment issued approximately $136 million in equity through a primary stock issuance. There were no debt repurchases in the quarter. With that, I will turn it back over to Gary for his final remarks. Gary Loveman : Thanks Donald. Caesars\u2019 execution on its strategic and capital structure initiatives has benefitted the company and provided a runway for growth. Our work in Vegas now turns to maximizing the benefits from the innovative investments at the center of the Strip, amidst a general context of improving market dynamics. Upon completion of the capital structure actions I have described, Caesars is much better positioned to reduce CEOC\u2019s leverage, improve cash flows and increase shareholder value.   Let me note that during today\u2019s Q&A session, we will not be able to provide any additional disclosures related to the capital structure transactions that are under way. We have provided as much detail as we are presently able to and will release additional details as they become available. Operator we are now happy to take questions on the company\u2019s operations. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from James Kayler from Bank of America. Your line is open. James Kayler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  I guess just first, was about a month of the High Roller and the LINQ being open, can you give us any more color around visitation and ridership stats on the High Roller as well as maybe the cash comp mix? Gary Loveman : I will say a word or two about it although I may not be as specific as you would like. We have had 1000s of riders a day, it's ramping up at a rate that we\u2019re very enthusiastic about recognizing that not knowing exactly when the High Roller would be permitted, we were not in a position to begin to market it with a known execution date. So the marketing for the High Roller is just now beginning to ramp up. For example if you had checked into one of our hotels recently you would have not seen or been told much about the High Roller. So the early visitation patterns have been in our view quite strong and the ridership has been virtually all cash. We haven't begun to comp it much yet at all. Donald Colvin : And just complement to what Gary said, there is few additions over that to the High Roller, one, we have got an nice complement in cash beverage revenue, I known people riding the High Roller like to enjoy beverage and won't be at last [ph] . To compliment that as well we have also got some good banquet business and special events which is another pleasant event and then we have got nice souvenir shop activity as well. So overall a pretty comfortable beginning. James Kayler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Some of your competitors that have already reported have talked a bit about April trends and talked about some continued softness in the regional markets. Can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in your business? I mean do you echo what they have said? Any particular trends that you guys are following? Gary Loveman : I think our observations are accurate given our experiences and the problem we\u2019re all describing James, is the softness in trip frequency among known customers particularly in lower categories of spend. So these are customers that we have known a long time, they visited us at a known frequency for some period of time and we observe the frequency of visitation falling off in the regional markets. And we don\u2019t tend to say very much on a forward-looking basis but I would suggest that those trends in the regional markets have continued. The destination markets are a different phenomenon where visitations have been very strong. James Kayler - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just my last question, there are couple of mentions in the press release and in the remarks about increased marketing expense. Are you guys sort of changing how you\u2019re marketing? Are you trying new things? I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for what might be driving some of those marketing expenses? Gary Loveman : Sure. As I have described our previous calls, we\u2019re always trying to find where there is some elasticity and our customers\u2019 willingness to visit us. We don\u2019t want to pay more to get a visit we would have received otherwise but we\u2019re willing to pay more to encourage a visit we might not have gotten otherwise. So for example if we have a visitor who is routinely with us on a Saturday we might to try to convince him to come also on a Tuesday and spend a little bit more to do so and sometimes as was true in the good old days before 2007 that was very frequently an efficacious way to proceed and more recently since 2008 it has been much harder to do it successfully. I think what you see it from us is not so much a different way to market but an effort on the heels of some evidence that the economy was improving. To see if we can get back to a period of driving additional trips and as you\u2019ve seen from the first quarter results that\u2019s been difficult. Outside of Las Vegas I want to keep making that decision, this is my remarks really pertain to regional markets. Operator : Your next question comes from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: I want to I guess start with -- I was hoping you can give us any help with what\u2019s going on in AC and kind of talk about the future there with a lot of continued expansion in the North East? Gary Loveman : Well AC has been the biggest problem the company has faced in the last several years, the business at AC, all the businesses in AC are in tremendous pressure, when the Revel [ph] joined the market as you all know it didn\u2019t do anything to grow it, instead it just took a portion of the existing level of activity. There is too much capacity in Atlantic City currently such that the returns to existing capacity are under great pressure and we have experienced that as the largest provider. So we\u2019re looking at all of our options to continue to reduce the cost of doing business here, options to reduce capacity. You\u2019ve seen just with the closure of the Atlantic Club, some moving in that direction and it's possible with the continuing trends and you will see more of that. I think that\u2019s the normal self-correcting, healing that you would like to see in a market like this. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: And then I noticed you guys on the OpCo side, you had a lot more cost savings. I was wondering if you could talk about where those came from? Donald Colvin : We run a lot of initiatives in, and you can call it five by five [ph] programs. They cover a vast range of things, scheduling, improved productivity, some cost reductions, reduced capacity that Gary had referred to. So it's a whole plethora. There is not one or two, there is many items I think indeed, there are several 100 items on the list of cost reductions. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: Okay. And then I know you guys don\u2019t like to quantify hold impact or whether stuff like that but I was wondering if you could comment where the hold impact, what market it was in OpCo. Gary Loveman : The hold impacts were negligible Susan. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin Coyne from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : I was wondering I\u2019m not going to ask you about the pending transactions, what it seems at least the Las Vegas asset sale has closed basically. I was just wondering, I know you\u2019re expecting 1.8 billion of net proceeds there and I guess in the future you\u2019re going to let the market know how you\u2019re going to use those. Can you let us know what the timing is about how those when you will let us know about those proceeds as well as the event in New Orleans doesn\u2019t go through how much lower would those proceeds be? Gary Loveman : We have a long time to decide how to use the proceeds and you won't be surprised by my answer, we will use where the returns are greatest. If you look at our options, our capital structures there is a variety of ways that those proceeds could be deployed. So you will have to regrettably just standby. We have 18 months to come to a conclusion as to how those proceeds will be deployed. With respect to New Orleans I\u2019m quite confident that that transaction will close. Of course I can\u2019t promise that it won't but in the event it didn\u2019t and we were not able to persuade the regulatory there affirmatively then we would simply standout from that and proceed with the three that are now behind us. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : And again I\u2019m not going to focus on current transactions but I\u2019ve got a lot of questions today from bond holders just regarding future transactions because you guys have certainly been busy and when I listen to your comments you stated in the prepared remarks that all three entities, CEOC, CERP and CGP all have exposure to Las Vegas market and share in the benefits but in yesterday\u2019s announcement it kind of expressed a view that management moved \u201ccapital intensive assets\u201d to CGP and I think secured lenders are just trying to think about Caesars Palace and could that be sold to an affiliated entity and I was wondering if you cared to put to bed any concerns about that potentially being sold to CGP or CERP in the future? Gary Loveman : I\u2019m not going to be able to do that for you Kevin one way or the other. The document speak to what one can and cannot do and the terms under which the transaction is going to occur. I do want to just revise slightly the assumption of the question and that is capital intensive properties. We discussed in our rationale for the movement of the Quad for example over to Caesars Growth Partners that it requires a lot of maintenance CapEx and CECO balance sheet was not well suited to that objective. So that was part of the rationale for the transaction. You would have to decide for yourself whether Caesars Palace fits it similarly but clearly it's in a very different position. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Okay and if I can just squeeze in one more, can you confirm that CEC equity purchase by an unaffiliated party? Gary Loveman : The CEOC equity is that what you mean? Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Gary Loveman : I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re crippling everyone with acronyms here but the CEOC equity purchases were from an unaffiliated parties. Operator : Your next question comes from (indiscernible) from UBS. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : First of all like the pro forma EBITDA number, we look at the release at about 1.28, is it fair to assume based on the run-rate EBITDA provided for the four property sold closer to 1.1? Donald Colvin : I think we gave a press release, where we gave range -- Unidentified Analyst : Right. Donald Colvin : Of properties as well and from my memory was it not like 140 to 160 or something like that? Or is it 175? So that was roughly the range. I think you\u2019re pretty close to it. But obviously we will update that as we have more disclosures as we move forward. So that\u2019s a live number and we\u2019re in a market that\u2019s changing in a rapid way. Unidentified Analyst : The other question I had I know you can\u2019t comment about the current transaction but yesterday\u2019s release noted that you would look to opportunistically look to do something with the first lien bonds as well as part of the B7 transaction. Can you comment on that? Gary Loveman : I don\u2019t recall that we said we look to do something opportunistically with the first lien. We talked about the amendment that we were seeking and the role that the more senior lenders played in that process but I don\u2019t recall something about an opportunistic transaction with the first lien. Unidentified Analyst : The way I read it was using a portion of the incremental proceeds to retire existing first lien notes and additional indebtedness. Gary Loveman : I think that just portrays one option of the use of proceeds. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Gary Loveman : Okay, hearing no further questions we thank everyone for their participation in our call this afternoon. We will be speaking to you next quarter on schedule. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Now, let me turn it over to Gary. Gary Loveman : Thank you, Eric and thank for your linguistic training. For some time now, I have been talking to all of you about the transformation of our industry from one built around gaming to a more multi-dimensional hospitality and entertainment business. Nowhere is this dynamic more evident than in Las Vegas, where hospitality is clearly the driving force across our investments and throughout the city. For this reason, we have devoted nearly all of our new capital investment and square footage on the East Side of the Strip to innovative hospitality projects. During the second quarter, we achieved several milestones in our strategy to expand and enhance our hospitality offerings. We opened The Cromwell boutique hotel, including Drai\u2019s and Giada\u2019s restaurant. We completed the opening of the LINQ and the High Roller and began the renovation of The Quad. I am very pleased with the great start these new assets are demonstrating and I am optimistic about their future impact on the three primary entities that comprise Caesars Entertainment. Since our last call, we have completed additional steps to improve the company\u2019s financial condition. As a result of the various transactions, we think it appropriate to think of Caesars Entertainment as a holding company, consisting of three primary structures in which Caesars holds economic interest : Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, CERP; Caesars Growth Partners, CGP; and Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, which you are all familiar with. CERP and CGP are cash flow positive entities with outsized exposure to destination markets, particularly in Las Vegas. As I have described in the past, CGP is the primary growth vehicle for the company\u2019s online and offline distribution channels. CEOC, which remains heavily levered, is the focus of our ongoing work to improve its capital structure. The holding company structure that has emerged, along with the pending formation of Caesars Enterprise Services, which remains subject to regulatory approval facilitates ongoing access to Total Rewards and other shared services for properties within all three entities. The structure will also create an efficient mechanism for ongoing investment in the growth of Total Rewards network, the benefits of which will accrue to each of our entities. With that in mind, I will review second quarter performance and developments in the context of the holding company structure. We are encouraged by visitation and spending trends in Las Vegas, which positively impacted results at our entities. Spanning the full Caesars network in Las Vegas, we saw RevPAR grow 8% in the second quarter driven in part by recent innovations \u2013 renovations I should say. Over the last four quarters, RevPar has grown 12% across the city, approximately double the growth for the city overall. Within CIE, the social and mobile games business posted an exceptionally strong quarter. Activity in the regional markets and Atlantic City however, remains depressed, contributing to declines in revenue and EBITDA at CEOC. Beginning with CERP, revenues grew modestly led by the opening of the LINQ and High Roller as well as revenue increases in CERP\u2019s hotel and food and beverage offerings. Broadly, volumes were quite strong in the second quarter at CERP\u2019s Las Vegas properties, especially considering the impact of out of order rooms at adjoining properties, which negatively impacted walk-in visitation. Key business indicators in Las Vegas increased in nearly every category. In gaming, slot and table volumes increased 2% and 7% respectively and our food outlet covers saw a slight uptick. In addition, lodging revenues increased 5% in the quarter driven largely by improved rate. These highlights were offset by gaming revenue declines, driven by unfavorable hold at Paris and weak volumes at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. Operating expenses at CERP\u2019s properties increased including labor costs related to the opening of several new restaurants outlets as well as increased marketing spend. Additionally, the prior year period benefited from a non-recurring expense reversal related to the taxability of complimentary meals provided to employees in Nevada. We have been pleased with the High Roller\u2019s performance to-date, which has not only transformed the Las Vegas skyline but has added a substantial new experience to the operations in the city. The wheel has quickly become one of the top paid admission destinations in Las Vegas. Ridership continues to ramp as we promote the experience and the attraction gains exposure. Since opening in late March, the High Roller has already welcomed well over 0.5 million riders. Unlike many other attractions, there is a nearly unlimited opportunity to create customized experiences on the High Roller. It\u2019s already been the site of dozens of marriage proposals, bachelor and bachelorette parties, weddings, and corporate outlet \u2013 outings I should say. The newly introduced Happy Hour on the Wheel has seen very high demand and it is quickly becoming the go-to-social destination in Las Vegas. We are confident that visitation will continue to grow steadily in the months ahead. Since opening earlier this year, the LINQ has presented an entirely new entertainment and retail experience for visitors and locals alike. Some of our anchor partners have received accolades and great recognition. Brooklyn Bowl for example, was recently recognized as the best music venue and best new venue in all of Las Vegas. CERP also includes Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City and as of the third quarter the meetings facility that is currently under construction adjacent to Harrah\u2019s will also be in CERP. The development of the meetings facility and enhancement of some of our hospitality offerings in Atlantic City are consistent with our long-held view that the market needs to attract new types of category to visitors and reduce gaming capacity. In June, we announced the difficult decision to close Showboat at the end of the month \u2013 at the end of August. Other participants in the market have followed the suit and what we believe to be a painful but constructive development. We are hopeful that rationalization of capacity in Atlantic City combined with concerted efforts to attract mid-week traffic and hospitality guests will help to stabilize this market. Moving on to Growth Partners, my colleague Mitch detailed this morning from Tel Aviv, CGP\u2019s delivery of excellent results in the quarter led by 95% revenue growth in CIE. CIE\u2019s record results were driven by newly launched content on existing social and mobile game platforms, the House of Fun acquisition and real money online gaming growth. Social and mobile games revenues increased 90% as the number of paying users grew to over 500,000 and average revenue per user grew to $0.26, up from $0.24 in the prior quarter. Separately, online gaming activity in Nevada increased in the quarter and our share grew significantly as excitement around the 45th World Series of Poker event at the Rio drove volumes on our online site. In New Jersey, we were pleased with the market share reported during the second quarter. CGP will launch new slot content and a mobile app for CaesarsCasino.com later in Q3 in New Jersey. Looking ahead, Mitch and his team remain optimistic on a further state-by-state rollout for online for money gaming. CGP\u2019s Las Vegas properties delivered a strong quarter driven by the very successful opening of the Cromwell and Drai\u2019s nightclub. The property has been a source of excitement in our network and on the Strip. Planet Hollywood continues to benefit from the Britney Spears residency. Last month, Pollstar, a trade publication that follows the worldwide concert industry, released its mid-year survey results that confirmed Britney Spears is garnering one of the highest ticket prices in America, second only to Celine Dion at Caesars Palace. Additionally, the Axis Theater joined the Coliseum as one of the top 20 worldwide theatre venues based on ticket sales. CGP was created to pursue high potential growth projects. Consistent with that mission, CGP is investing $223 million to transform The Quad into the LINQ Hotel & Casino. CGP has also submitted an application to develop this proposed $880 million development of Caesars New York in the Hudson Valley. The renovation of the Quad and if CGP is successful in its attempt to secure a license in New York, Caesars New York will result in the expansion of the Caesars network which in turn benefits each of the component parts of Caesars Entertainment. CGP also has a 41% equity ownership in Horseshoe Baltimore, which will celebrate its grand opening in about two weeks. We are enthusiastic about this urban destination and believe it will be beneficial, both to the network and to the community in which it resides. Similar to CGP, CEOC benefited from favorable trends in Las Vegas, resulting in a particularly good quarter for our flagship at Caesars Palace. The property benefited from very strong VIP baccarat play as well as favorable hold year-on-year. Away from Caesars Palace, Atlantic City and the regional markets that make up the rest of CEOC had a challenging second quarter. Volumes in Atlantic City and Illinois declined driven by non-VIP trip declines. While we see no indication that the difficult conditions facing the regional markets will change materially in the near-term, we are working to maximize EBITDA on lower revenue. In the most extreme cases, we have reduced capacity to appropriately align supply in markets where the levels or I should say to align supply in certain markets with the level of demand we experienced there. We closed Harrah\u2019s Tunica on June 2 and as I mentioned earlier, announced plans to close Showboat Atlantic City at the end of August. These difficult actions follow persistent declines in trips and volumes in both markets. Since our last call, we have completed several capital market transactions as part of our ongoing efforts to improve CEOC\u2019s capital structure. At the end of July, we completed the $1.75 billion B7 transaction, the associated tender offers for CEOC debt maturing in 2015 and an amendment to CEOC\u2019s credit facility. The completion of these transactions, announced in May, provides CEOC with maturity runway and covenant headroom to continue executing its de-leverage plan. Most recently, CEOC announced additional steps to position itself for de-leveraging in a possible stock listing, including the appointment of the executive team and the addition of two independent directors to its Board. John Payne is now CEO of CEOC and Mary Beth Higgins is our CFO at CEOC. John has a deep understanding of the company\u2019s regional markets, having served previously as President of the company\u2019s Central Division. I have complete confidence in his ability to drive value at CEOC. Mary Beth is a great addition to the team given her financial management expertise in the gaming industry. Across the enterprise, we are implementing new marketing and gaming initiatives, which we expect will be driven by Caesars Enterprise Services once it has been fully established and receives regulatory approval. In early 2013, we re-launched the Total Rewards Visa card program, the only co-branded credit card in the casino entertainment industry. This program is designed to amplify the benefits of Total Rewards for cardholders and provides another way for us to deepen relationships with Total Rewards members. Customers who are Total Rewards Visa cardholders have increased their trips to Caesars affiliated properties by 13% and have boosted their gaming and hospitality spend by 7% and 31% respectively during the six months following the date when they received the card, clearly a very successful program. On our gaming floors, we replaced 40% of our slot product in Las Vegas during the past 18 months. Our investment has targeted video poker, high limit and penny games and is intended to drive incremental slot play across a wide range of visitor segments. At several properties, we are testing new concepts to reinvigorate the gaming floor and attract new or customers whose trip volume has declined. At the Quad, we have opened the TAG lounge, our interpretation of a modern sports bar and lounge integrated with electronic table games. The pilot at the Quad has been successful in appealing to younger guests. We recently opened a second TAG lounge in Iowa and plan to open similar experiences at two more properties in the coming months. Finally, on the international development front, our team is working on the design and other details for our planned project in Incheon, South Korea. When I was in Seoul just this past June, each of the government leaders I met with urged us to open the resort before the 2018 Winter Olympics there and we are mobilizing our efforts in order to meet that target. Let me now turn the call over to Donald Colvin to review consolidated financial performance for the second quarter. Mr. Colvin Donald Colvin : Thank you, Gary. Before I cover the financial results, let me reiterate that we have shifted Caesars Entertainment financial reporting and disclosure practices to align with the way investors are valuing the business, which is as a holding company with three distinct equity holdings. I will provide a brief recap of the company\u2019s second quarter performance on a consolidated basis. Second quarter consolidated net revenues were up 3% from the prior year to $2.2 billion as increases in social and mobile games as well as contributions from the LINQ and the High Roller were partially offset by a decline in casino revenue. Casino revenue declines of 1.9% were driven by lower volumes and visitation, primarily in Atlantic City and the regional markets, as well as the deconsolidation of Conrad Punta del Este. Room revenue decreased 0.7% year-over-year, while overall ADR increased, benefiting from resort fees and hospitality initiatives. Occupancy decreased, partially impacted by out of order rooms, due to the renovation efforts at the Quad. F&B revenue was up 1.6% year-over-year due to the performance of several new restaurant openings last year including Nobu and multiple Gordon Ramsay venues. Other revenue rose 43.7% year-over-year due to strong growth in social and mobile games at CIE and third party rent and entertainment revenue from the LINQ, High Roller, Planet Hollywood and the Cromwell. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 3% year-over-year to $455 million due to higher property operating costs offset by strength in CIE margins. Separately, as Gary mentioned earlier, the completion of our $1.75 billion first lien debt offering clears the runway for deleveraging as we have addressed 2015 maturities and through the amendment, created additional headroom under the CEOC covenant requirement. We are committed to driving efficiency, decreasing working capital, generating operating and EBITDA growth and further improving our balance sheet with a particular focus on CEOC\u2019s capital structure. With that, I will turn it back to Gary for his closing remarks. Gary Loveman : Thank you, Donald. As we head into the fall, I am very pleased with what we have on offer to customers on the east side of the Strip and throughout Las Vegas broadly. We have some of the most innovative and novel new entertainment options available to a wide range of guests and we are working more and more effectively to get our competitors\u2019 guests to come down and see us at the center of the Strip. I am looking forward to a very successful further implementation of these assets and the other renovations and actions we have taken in Las Vegas as we get into the seasonally beneficial fall part of the calendar in Las Vegas. And as you may have read here and there we continue to take steps to delever CEOC and improve its operating performance. Over time, we expect the combination of these steps to enhance the company\u2019s cash flows and increase shareholder value overall. During today\u2019s Q&A session, as was the case last time we will not be able to disclose or provide any further information related to the capital structure or outstanding litigation. While we know this is disappointing to some of you this is the posture we need to take for the time being. We have provided as much detail as we are presently able to through our various releases and we will continue to release additional details as they become available. With that, operator we are now happy to take questions on the company\u2019s operations. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Farber from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. David Farber - Credit Suisse : Hi guys, how are you doing? Gary Loveman : Well. Thank you. David Farber - Credit Suisse : Good, I got a couple of questions and first off just Gary I don\u2019t know if you are \u2013 what level of comfort you have in talking about Caesar\u2019s operating company away from the results, so I am going to try and then I will back in other things if you think no good. But obviously you have hired John and the new Board members, I guess my question is given the hopes of deleveraging what kind of financial support could you envision given your offering in that process, given your management and the other entities are cash flow positive, any thoughts around that given you said at the CCR level that will be helpful? And then I have a number of follow-ups from there. Thanks. Gary Loveman : I am afraid you fell right into the demilitarized zone there, that\u2019s really in the terrain if I can\u2019t comment on. David Farber - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s it from me then. Thanks. Gary Loveman : Good. Operator : And your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good afternoon guys. Gary, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a couple of issues with hold in the quarter. I was wondering if it would be possible to quantify both, I think you mentioned Caesars Palace and Paris, but they fall in two different subsidiaries. Is it possible to quantify the type of impact that you saw with those kind of with and without? Gary Loveman : Yes, we can. We reported favorable hold at Caesars Palace. Eric is about to report to you where that came well. Are you, Eric or did I over promise? Eric Hession : Bear with us a minute, Shaun. Did you have a second question? Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Similar topic, I guess just overall you did briefly mentioned that the Showboat closure and your thoughts around that, but maybe you could just talk us through at higher levels as you guys are looking at the overall Mid-Atlantic region. You are opening Baltimore shortly. You are obviously building or looking to possibly build in our Orange County. Could you talk a little bit just about how you see the medium and long-term landscape really progressing for Atlantic City given the supply challenges from New York and Maryland? Gary Loveman : I will be happy to although it\u2019s obviously a sad story. People have to remember that Atlantic City was more than a $5 billion market, not that long ago principally before Pennsylvania gaming opened up. And as Pennsylvania gaming in particular became available to the incumbent customer group, the drive-in business at Atlantic City has all but disappeared. That was both a large and very lucrative part of what was on offer in Atlantic City. And I think most of us who work there agree that, that business will never return. So we will be left with a dramatically smaller base of business which is a group that arrives, stays in the hotel for a couple of days and enjoys a broader range of experience. That is the very good business, but it can\u2019t support 11 casinos that were necessary to support what used to be more than $5 billion revenue. So we are seeing exactly the kind of adjustment in supply. You would expect any other retail environment to experience, painful though it is. So, we have seen the Atlantic Club cease to operate as a casino. We have indicated that will be the case with Showboat. Now, Trump Plaza has said the same thing and you have read in today\u2019s disclosures on the rental process that there are no qualified bidders, suggesting that even at a de minimis price people find it hard to imagine they can make money operating the Rebel. Again, as I say, as sad as this is for the affected individuals, our employees and others, this is a healthy response to a problem of dramatically excess supply. If you turn from Atlantic City to some of the other cases that you mentioned, the circumstances are much more favorable. We watch Marilyn Live have a terrific start at Arundel Mills. We believe Baltimore will similarly have a very strong start with the market that has not been nearly so well serviced as what you see in Atlantic City. Similarly up in Orange County, we have a terrific location, a beautiful site. I think there is a very high level of gaming that will be available to whoever is fortunate enough to get a license in Orange County. That will have relatively little effect on Atlantic City given that there are already more proximate operators in places like Bethlehem, Aqueduct, Yonkers, and on the southern end in Delaware and Maryland. So most of the pain that Atlantic City is going to feel most of it has already been felt, although there will be a little bit more to go. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s helpful. And Eric, did you get those numbers or not yet? Eric Hession : Yes, we got them, Shaun. Apologize for the delay. So, from a CEOC perspective, we calculate that we were approximately $13 million favorable in aggregate. Gary Loveman : So, that\u2019s Caesars Palace, majority of it. Eric Hession : Caesars was more than that as we held negative in Atlantic City and in the regions. So, Caesars was slightly more than $20 million favorable. CERP, as we mentioned, was slightly unfavorable. And then CGP was slightly favorable. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess my last question and I hope this one doesn\u2019t jump into the demilitarized zone, but I did notice that your $650 million of interest expense in the quarter was actually a decent amount higher than what we had modeled. I know there is a huge amount of moving pieces on this, but I believe a piece of it was probably the bridge loan financing, which may have been at a different rate than what we were underwriting. So, here is what we are trying to think about kind of general cash flows at the overall consolidated level any kind of help you could give us with just like run rate, will that 650 start to come down a little bit or is that fairly indicative of kind of the new financing structure with the $1.75 billion term loan B7 that would be helpful? Eric Hession : Yes. Shaun, so there were number of factors over the last say six months that have driven off the interest expense. It started with the refinancing of the CMBS, if you recall that had extremely low interest rate. And although we feel that it was very positive to refinance it, it was reset to the then current market rates which were higher. Then when we \u2013 when CGP financed the four property asset purchase that was incremental debt from a consolidated perspective. And then as you mentioned we did have the $1.75 billion facility in escrow while we were paying both on the term loan that it retired and the bonds as well as that facility. So I think as of this point it should be fairly straight forward to calculate the true cash interest expense. I would just remind you to adjust for the swaps that should be rolling off at the beginning of May. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to be clear, again in the quarter was there a double count where you guys were kind of waiting to finance something, so is that based on what you are saying? Eric Hession : Yes, that\u2019s right Shaun, there was a double count with the $1.75 billion for a period of time while that was in escrow. Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That\u2019s all I was looking for. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Gary Loveman : Next question operator. Operator : And your next question comes from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: Good afternoon. I wanted to start with CERP if I may I guess I was just \u2013 look we were expecting better performance out of CERP with all releases and I know Gary you talked a lot about the Wheel, so I know you talked about the slightly unfavorable hold and higher costs and I know they there were \u2013 there was the insurance but if you can give any other details around because even on the revenue side we would have expected it to come in higher than it did? Gary Loveman : Yes. So two thoughts on this, I am going to let Eric to elaborate \u2013 Eric and Donald to elaborate on this. The first is I am very happy with the level of activity we had at the wheel, if you think about a new asset that\u2019s ramping up in a city where it was not known to your visitors or marketed before its beginning \u2013 I am very pleased with where it stands. We have spent more to market the CERP assets broadly than I would have liked or anticipated. So while I was pleased with some of the revenue numbers we didn\u2019t get the flow-through on it that I would have imagined we would have received. So for me it\u2019s a margin question to a greater degree than it\u2019s been a revenue question. Eric, you want to add to that? Eric Hession : Yes, just to provide a few specifics to we did have a $9 million one-time gain in the prior year period for the reversal of the comp tax. We had the \u2013 I mentioned earlier the negative hold that was slightly negative. And then one other aspects that impacted our margins negatively was the opening of the new food and beverage facility and the associated ramp up with those. The margins as you know on food and beverage are generally low to begin and particularly when they are initiating the opening stages and in the first six months of operations they have to ramp up due to the staffing and cost of goods considerations. Gary Loveman : Yes. And Sue I will add one other thing this maybe more detail than you care to hear. But we have one property, one of our older properties in that bucket that did more poorly than it has traditionally done in large part because we have the place ripped up for renovation. We were installing new carpets in the casino and modifying two of its critical restaurants. So it underperformed where we might have thought it would be \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t have had any way really to know that. So it was a lot of odds and ends at CERP but I think you will see that performance improve. Donald Colvin : I think it\u2019s you have done a lot of detailed analysis into this Susan we don\u2019t think the second quarter is representative of how you should see that going forward. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: Okay, great. And then if I can just switch on to OpCo I was curious why the property EBITDA and the adjusted EBITDA were so close a number, I know there was a one-time gain as well in OpCo but was there any other reasons for those the EBITDA numbers to be that close? Jacqueline Beato : Sue I think it might \u2013 it\u2019s Jacque I think it might still have to do with how we treat Punta in the adjusted EBITDA standpoint where it\u2019s not in property but is allowed in adjusted because of the covenant calculation. And so where you usually see adjusted EBITDA lower than property that helps adjusted back up. Susan Berliner - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Kevin Coyne from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just in the press release, you mentioned the \u201cstimulating greater traffic\u201d at the Lincoln through the High Roller, is there any way you can quantify what you are seeing behind that in terms of percentage growth in traffic? Gary Loveman : You are referring to growth in traffic to the wheel itself or to the other properties. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : That LINQ and the wheel are generating traffic to the other properties, I guess, you said stimulating greater traffic to Caesars\u2019 affiliated properties? Gary Loveman : Yes. I don\u2019t think we can quote you a specific number, but you should think about thousand of visitors a day, that are riding the wheel and a substantially larger are visiting the LINQ. And then a meaningful percentage of those folks are making their way into the Quad or into Flamingo or into other properties on the East Side of the Strip. Our job of course is to monetize those visits and that\u2019s the harder work, getting there people is relatively easy, getting more of them engaged in some of the things we have to offer in both places is the bigger challenge. The renovation of the Quad I think will help that quite a bit. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Just sticking on the High Roller, I know during the marketing period you had some revenue and utilization and ROI expectations, would you still say that those are on track? Gary Loveman : I will let Eric answer, but the short answer is yes. Eric Hession : Yes. We, from a financing perspective, we had provided a range of where we expected the EBITDA in the performance of the both the LINQ and the wheel. And we are performing within that range the range entity on a combined basis made approximately $10 million of EBITDA in the quarter. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Gary Loveman : I would add we didn\u2019t know when the wheel would be permitted. You can\u2019t start marketing an attraction whose launch date is unknown to you. So, we were given the permit in a very favorable way by the county safety and inspection people and had to start marketing it immediately. So, the ramp up takes some time to get people to know that this thing exists, how long it takes to ride it, how much it costs, where it is that you can get a cocktail while you are on board and what you can do for special events and so on. So, in a very short period of time, we have this thing up to being probably, it\u2019s a little hard to confirm this, but probably the most visited attraction in Las Vegas already. And I think we will see it goes substantially beyond that in the very near-term. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Maybe we could just switch to, let\u2019s say, New York/New Jersey, obviously we have seen headlines about a potential deal for casinos in Northern New Jersey. Are you getting any sense would that be an open bidding process or would they favor existing AC operators and would there be any concern if you were in Orange County that would that kind of keep you out of that \u2013 out of the running for that? Gary Loveman : It wouldn\u2019t concern me at either level. It wouldn\u2019t concern the case that we are building for the casino in Orange County nor would we be, in my view, would we be kept out. I mean, we are a very large portion of Atlantic City. And I think the one thing you can count on is that whatever at some day, at some point were to be liberalized in the north, it would be done with an eye to addressing some of the challenges in the south. If you look at all these buildings wind up on the shore in Atlantic City and ask yourself what\u2019s the appropriate future for this area and for these buildings, it has to be some sort of multi-dimensional shore side resort. I mean, they are not going to be casinos anymore, but you want to be something that\u2019s desirable and you want the broad experience in the south to be appealing. It is really quite a remarkable place and it ought to continue to be. So my suspicion although I am certainly not an elected official in New Jersey, is that whatever is done in the north will to some degree be used to help circumstances in the south. And it could well be that the existing operators in the south are the principal participants in the north that the tax rat was set at a relatively high level, so that some of the proceeds from the north can be redistributed to support transition in the south. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Thank you for that. Just a follow-up, I know in previous comments you have mentioned that part of the rationale for moving or selling some of the assets from CEOC to CGP was because of the higher capital intensity. I was just wondering, can we \u2013 are you still affirming that Caesars Palace is still considered a capital light property? Gary Loveman : You have to giggle a little bit when you ask that question. Caesars Palace has never been a capital light property. We have put a lot of money into Caesars Palace over a long period of time. I think it remains to be seen what the proper location is for Caesars Palace and we will see how that goes as we work our way through the de-leveraging of CEOC. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. I appreciate that. And just one other last one perhaps for Donald, I know obviously there has been statements in the public domain about the company and it seems that you have basically said you are committed to CEOC\u2019s financial solvency. So, I mean, when you look out over the remainder of 2014, is it safe to say that you intend to pay all your upcoming coupons on time? Donald Colvin : While we haven\u2019t announced that, we have a lot of liquidity in CEOC over $2 billion and we have satisfied all maturities as they have come due. So, if we change our mind, we will let you know, but we have full liquidity to satisfy all demands that can be put upon us. Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs : Alright, thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Gary Loveman : Okay, operator, thank you. Thanks to all the participants and attendees on today\u2019s call. Appreciate you having with us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Connor and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Caesars Entertainment Corporation 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Hession, Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, you may begin your conference. Eric Hession : Good afternoon and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Third Quarter 2014 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Gary Loveman, our Chief Executive Officer; and Donald Colvin, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll turn the call over to your questions. A copy of our press release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and a replay of this conference call will be available in the Investor Relations section on our website at caesars.com.

Recall, that Caesars Entertainment is a holding company, consisting of three primary entities in which Caesars Entertainment holds an economic interest : Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties; Caesars Growth Partners, and; Caesars Entertainment Operating Company. CERP and CGP have outsized exposure to destination markets, particularly in Las Vegas. As I have described in the past CGP is the primary growth vehicle for the company\u2019s online and offline distribution channels. CEOC, which remains heavily levered, is the focus of our ongoing work to address its capital structure. The holding company structure that has emerged, along with the implementation of Caesars Enterprise Services in certain jurisdictions, facilitates ongoing access to Total Rewards and other shared services for properties within CERP, CGP, and CEOC. The structure also creates an efficient mechanism for ongoing investment in the growth of the Total Rewards network, the benefits of which will accrue to each of our entities. Today we filed a form extending the time in which we will file our Form 10-Q. The company does not expect any material changes to its financial results to be reflected in the Form 10-Q when filed, relative to what is communicated in today\u2019s press release. The company intends to file the Form 10-Q within the five day extension period. As we move forward with this call, the words company, Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our and us refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities, unless otherwise stated, or context requires otherwise. Now let me turn it over to Gary. Gary Loveman : Thank you Eric and good afternoon everyone. The third quarter of 2014 was marked by several milestones in our efforts to expand distribution into high-growth markets and further enhance Caesars\u2019 hospitality and entertainment assets. However, expenses related to some of these items along with substantial bad luck negatively impacted results in the period. Among these expenses were construction disruption, adverse hold and higher start-up costs associated with the ramp of several hospitality options across our network and higher marketing expenses. As a result, we saw revenue increases associated with these assets, though did not realize the benefit to profitability we expect to see in future periods. That said, I am enthusiastic about how our new and refreshed assets have performed and believe they better position Caesars Entertainment to capitalize on the strong underlying fundamentals in Las Vegas. The investment impact is most evident in our CERP entity, where several new offerings have recently come online. Also, CGP is beginning to realize returns on its previous investments. Since our last call, we have commenced formal discussions with several groups of creditors related to our collective efforts to improve the financial condition of CEOC. As discussed on prior calls, we are keenly focused on deleveraging CEOC and we refer you to our Form 10-Q to be filed later this week for a further discussion of CEOC\u2019s capital structure and liquidity position. While it is premature to report on the details of these negotiations with creditors, it is reasonable to say that these talks have been constructive. Further, we are intensely focused on ensuring operating costs are aligned with the current environment to enhance CEC\u2019s profitability. To that end we are acting to reduce expenses and enhance EBITDA across the company through a variety of initiatives in operations, marketing and corporate expenses. We expect to produce an incremental $250 million to $300 million of EBITDA in 2015 as a result of these actions. The overwhelming majority of this increase will be driven by cost savings. I will now turn to the performance of our business in the third quarter recently concluded. In Las Vegas, I am encouraged by year-over-year increases in key tourism indicators, including Strip occupancy, airport traffic, ADR, RevPAR and convention attendance. These are all positive signs for the market as a whole and for our business. The trend reinforces our confidence in the investments we have made on the Strip. While our new investments in Vegas have added significant value to our portfolio, our Las Vegas properties did not fully benefit from the market growth this quarter due to several costs. As I mentioned namely unfavorable hold, bad debt expense, and rooms out of service for renovation. With the exception of the renovation impact which we anticipate will continue for several quarters, we expect these issues to normalize in future quarters, and continue to view the Las Vegas market with optimism. Ultimately, we anticipate the ongoing recovery in Las Vegas, coupled with growing awareness of our new offerings, will drive increases in our profitability over time. At Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, or CERP, third quarter revenue increased due to contributions from the LINQ and High Roller and growth in the hotel and food and beverage offerings. CERP\u2019s Strip properties posted 2% growth in lodging revenue driven largely by an increase in cash ADR as a result of various hospitality initiatives. Gaming revenues declined as an increase in promotional allowances coupled with lower volumes was partially offset by favorable hold in Atlantic City. Direct operating expenses at CERP\u2019s properties were higher in the quarter due primarily to the opening of several new dining outlets and higher marketing expenses compared with a year ago. The increase in marketing expenses was largely a result of programs aimed at retaining guests in Atlantic City following the closure of our Showboat property. These incentives increased guest reinvestment in an effort to entice loyal customers to visit our other properties in the market, especially CERP members at Atlantic City. We are encouraged by the increased visitation, and hope to retain these players at more normalized investment levels going forward. Our marketing activities at the LINQ and the High Roller are generating greater customer awareness and engagement. The Happy Half-Hour or hour as you wish on the High Roller and the weekly BLOQ parties have been particularly successful in generating Food and Revenue and garnering a strong ticket price as well driving additional riders to the wheel and foot traffic through the corridor. We are currently rolling out the next phase of our advertising and marketing activities to stimulate even more traffic to the LINQ promenade. The properties on the East side of the Strip have benefited from this additional traffic, particularly the Flamingo, which witnessed double digit growth in slot volume in the third quarter. During the period, we opened the Fulton Street Food Hall at Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas, a chef driven marketplace and the first food hall concept on the Strip. The Food Hall is open 24 hours a day and combines a sit down restaurant experience with the convenience of a to-go caf\u00e9. In Atlantic City, we recently celebrated the topping off of CERP\u2019s waterfront meetings facility adjacent to Harrah\u2019s. We are pleased to have already booked multiple events at the facility, including a 1,400-person trade show and network event for UniPro next fall. Overall, our meetings and convention team has secured 25 bookings with 36,000 committed room nights and is currently in negotiation with 22 additional groups for 37,000 room nights. Our early success here supports the investment thesis that the city will benefit from a robust meetings business. We are optimistic the addition of this center to Atlantic City will help stimulate new visitation, particularly mid-week. Turning next to Growth Partners, Caesar\u2019s Interactive Entertainment delivered another strong quarter as you heard this morning. CIE\u2019s third-quarter revenue and EBITDA set new records for the business. Compared to the prior year revenue increased 105% and EBITDA rose 75%. As Mitch detailed this morning, these results are attributable to the team\u2019s emphasis on driving higher monetization and conversion among existing players, the release of new game content and broadening the distribution of CIE\u2019s social and mobile games across various platforms. The social and mobile games business delivered a 103% year over year increase in revenues and grew paying users and average revenue per user. In real-money online gaming space, CIE launched new slot content and a mobile app for CaesarsCasino.com in New Jersey. In addition, the Total Rewards loyalty program was integrated into CaesarsCasino.com, an important technological step as it enables customers to earn TR credit for online casino play as well as offline casino play. Growth Partners\u2019 brick and mortar properties also showed aggregate year-on-year growth mainly due to the addition of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. In Las Vegas, activity at The Cromwell is picking up nicely, with quarter-over-quarter improvement in occupancy since opening in May. Giada\u2019s also continues to generate high levels of demand. The restaurant is consistently fully booked, and began serving lunch in mid-July and breakfast in September. Performance at Drai\u2019s continues to exceed expectations, even after a strong initial debut. The LINQ Hotel & Casino, formerly The Quad, performance was negatively impacted by room closures related to the property\u2019s transformation, which amounted to an estimated $7 million to $10 million impact to revenue in the quarter as approximately half of the rooms were out of service. The property began to welcome its first guests on October 30, bringing over 800 rooms back online. The remaining rooms have been taken out of service now beginning the final phase of upgrades, which is projected to be completed in the first half of 2015. The newly renovated rooms are yielding more than double the cash ADR of the former Quad. Despite construction disruption, the casino has experienced increased foot traffic and visitation due to its proximity to the LINQ and High Roller and previously completed renovations to the lobby, including the casino floor. Slot and table volumes were up 26% and 22%, respectively. We expect additional enhancements, which include amenities such as a pool, cabanas, spa, salon and signature lobby bar, to boost the property\u2019s appeal and drive improved operating performance. We are looking forward to the imminent opening of the Grand Bazaar Shops at Bally\u2019s Las Vegas. The new third- party retail attraction will be accessible directly from the Strip, Bally\u2019s and Paris, and via the bridges from The Cromwell and Caesars Palace. Designed as a 21st-century bazaar, the Grand Bazaar Shops will feature approximately 150 shops and dining establishments, and some special attractions, including a vibrantly-colored rooftop design and a giant crystal starburst that creates a celebratory New Year\u2019s Eve-like experience daily. Tenants will include well-known brands like Superdry and Swatch and many new experiences. In August, we celebrated the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore with an event that welcomed visitors to what we believe will be Charm City\u2019s next great attraction. We are quite pleased with the property\u2019s performance since its opening, and have been experiencing strong food and beverage results as well. The property was designed to appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike. This approach is clearly resonating with customers, who are taking advantage of the wide array of entertainment options at the Horseshoe Baltimore. Turning new to CEOC, Caesars Palace experienced a particularly challenging quarter, which was the primary driver of the entity\u2019s weak results. Caesars Palace suffered from more than $35 million of unfavorable hold, somewhat lower volumes and an approximately $20 million increase in bad debt expense. The year ago period at Caesars Palace experienced exceedingly favorable hold on Baccarat, which made for a tough year over year comparison. Volume declines were largely attributable to a decline in high-end international play. Looking ahead, this particularly frustrating period of bad luck has continued into the fourth Quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we currently estimate more than $85 million of unfavorable hold impact in the second half of this year. Additionally, hospitality revenues were unfavorably impacted by the cancellation of many Celine Dion shows. We are in the process of securing acts to fill the Colosseum while Celine is on leave and look forward to her return. Also at Caesars Palace, we anticipate opening our newest nightclub addition, Omnia. Set to open in Spring 2015, Omnia will take over the former space of the iconic PURE Nightclub with a multi-level venue that will encompass a seductive ultra-lounge, a high-energy main room and mezzanine, as well as a breathtaking rooftop garden, showcasing panoramic views of the Strip. Performance in Atlantic City also weighed heavily on CEOC\u2019s results as the market continued to struggle with excess supply. While the closures of Showboat and other properties have been challenging for the city, we are optimistic that Atlantic City\u2019s transformation is under way and that, over time, revenues will stabilize and margins will improve. For quite some time, we have pursued the diversification and enhancement of our offerings there to attract new visitors. This year, CEOC has opened several new dining outlets at Bally\u2019s, which produced increases in visitation and an improvement in the guest experience. The transformation of Atlantic City certainly won\u2019t happen overnight, but we believe the new offerings will create new reasons for guests to visit and enhance the appeal of Atlantic City destination. Similar to CERP, CEOC expenses in the third quarter were higher due to the dining outlets ramping up as well as higher marketing expenses compared with last year. While it is still too early to quantify the impact that the Showboat and other Atlantic City property closings will have on our remaining three properties in the market, we believe that the reduction of gaming capacity will help create a more sustainable operational environment over the long term. On a more positive note, regional markets appear to be showing signs of stabilization. Net revenues at same store CEOC properties excluding Vegas and Atlantic Coast were flat with growth in several regions such as Louisiana and Northern Nevada regions offset by declines from regions such as Illinois and Indiana. The dynamics in the regional markets are looking better than they have for quite some time, particularly as there is limited new supply coming online throughout the country. In Tunica, for example, EBITDA grew despite the fact we operate one less property than we did a year ago. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic about slowing declines and signs of growth in some markets. In the meantime, we are focused on maximizing EBITDA at CEOC by improving operational performance and reducing leverage on the balance sheet. Also in the quarter, the company made ongoing progress on the roll-out of Caesars Enterprise Services. The first employees of the shared-services entity officially transferred in early October following the receipt of regulatory approval in New Jersey. Now, let me now turn the call over to Donald Colvin to review consolidated financial performance for the third quarter. Donald Colvin : Thank you Gary. I will provide a brief recap of the company\u2019s consolidated third quarter performance. Third quarter consolidated net revenues were up 6% from the prior year to $2.2 billion primarily due to growth in social and mobile games at CIE. Casino revenue increased 0.3% driven mainly by the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell, offset by significant unfavorable hold and lower volumes at Caesars Palace. Room revenue decreased 0.4% year over year as fewer available room nights at The LINQ Hotel & Casino due to renovations were partially offset by an 8.7% rise in cash ADR due to hospitality initiatives. RevPAR in the quarter increased 5.4%. Groups business was a highlight in Q3, generating a 10.6% revenue increase and a 4.9% operating income increase. As we look forward, we expect groups to continue to produce strong results in the remainder of 2014 and into 2015, with double digit increases in room nights and revenue. F&B revenue was up 7.4% year-over-year due to the strong performance of several new restaurant openings this year in Las Vegas including Giada\u2019s and Drai\u2019s at The Cromwell and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. Other revenue rose 53.3% year-over-year due to strong growth in social and mobile games at CIE and third party rent and entertainment revenue from the LINQ, High Roller, Planet Hollywood and the Cromwell. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 12.9% year-over-year to $443 million due to higher property operating costs offset by strength in CIE margins. Additionally, CERP and CGP each made initial cash payments to CES related to its launch in the amount of $42.5 million and $22.5 million respectively. In conclusion, we are committed to driving efficiency, decreasing working capital, generating EBITDA growth and further improving our balance sheet with a particular focus on CEOC\u2019s capital structure. On that note, I will turn it back to Gary for his closing remarks. Gary Loveman : Thank you, Donald for your remarks today and for your contribution to Caesar\u2019s as CFO. Earlier this afternoon we announced that Donald would retire from the company at the end of the year. Donald has been a critical addition to our company through an important time for our capital structure and operations. We are grateful to report his efforts and wish him well. I will miss his indomitable charm and the fact that no matter what he says it sounds better coming out of his mouth than anyone else I\u2019ve ever worked with. Beginning January 1st, Eric Hession, will assume the role of CFO. Eric is well known to all of you and is very much prepared for this job. He\u2019s played an instrumental role in the capital structure transaction that we\u2019ve pursued over the last several years as our Treasurer. Despite his [inaudible] which is an obstacle though a surmountable one I am extremely confident in his ability to meet our finance\u2026 I\u2019d also like to welcome Keith Causey, who joins us this afternoon, who recently joined as our Chief Accounting Officer. Keith joins us from General Motors, where he served as Executive Director of Global Business Services in Finance Department. Keith brings significant public company experience with large complex organizations and we\u2019re pleased to have him. Finally a few closing thoughts. While we were generally encouraged by revenue performance in those markets the combination of certain expenses and [inaudible] put significant pressure on our results for the quarter. While optimistic with the outcomes of these items in the future combined with actions to reduce operating cost across the enterprise we will yield improved results in future periods. During today\u2019s Q&A session we will not be able to provide you additional disclosures related to the company\u2019s capital structure and liquidity position as we will have additional disclosure around these topics when we file our 10-Q later this week. We have provided as much detail as we\u2019re presently able to do so and we\u2019ll release additional details as they become available. With that operator, we\u2019re now happy to take questions on the company\u2019s operations. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with the Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay? Gary Loveman : We hear you loud and clear Shaun, good afternoon. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fantastic. First I\u2019d like to offer my congratulations to Eric on the new move and thanks to Donald for his time. Just wanted to ask Gary if you could maybe walk us through little bit of on year-on-year impacts on a whole. So you said $35 million but it sounds like obviously you held high last year and then I think the more important step I think is probably the \u2013 implied $50 million so far in the 4Q and if you can just give us a little bit more color on how you held last year and if that\u2019s also up against a tough comp that be helpful. Gary Loveman : Yeah Shaun I mean I give you so much details as you like but you shouldn\u2019t inferred that the impact of the fourth quarter is $50 million. We were comparing very favorable hold in the third quarter of last year with quite unfortunate hold in the third quarter of this year and so far some ongoing sustained core hold through the month of October in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve announced in the material that the aggregate effect of that is $85 million. We also changed our bad debt accounting procedures such that the amount of bad debt accrual that we have to take this year was substantial higher than what was the case last year largely due to methodological reasons. So the sum of the two expenses was cumulative to the performance of Caesar\u2019s Palace in the third quarter. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. So it does include the bad debt as well that\u2019s cleared. And then my second question would be on the regional markets you called out some trends that you\u2019re seeing to performance so you guys have one of the broadest lenses overall than any of the companies that I think operate in a space. So was curious just get a drill down that a little bit give us a few more thoughts on player behavior what you\u2019re seeing in terms of [trips or cent] per visit and then also specifically if any of that improvement or signs of life you\u2019re seeing are extending to Atlantic City. Gary Loveman : Let me try to do justice to that question, my colleagues can modify this if you wish. It\u2019s really the sum of the very heterogeneous sub parts Shaun for example Indiana and Illinois have been rather weak due in large part to the very substantial number of the VLTs that legalized in Illinois, the number of gaming positions in aggregate at Illinois has risen like crazy and results out of the market are affected by that both on the Indiana and Illinois have been anemic. If you look at other areas for example in the Midwest and Missouri and Iowa in the Louisiana and Mississippi the results have been a bit a little bit more encouraging both for market reasons in the case of \u2013 because of the actions we took to modify our cost structures through the closing of [Showboat]. And that brings us into Atlantic City which is \u2013 remained at the top despite these four closures a lot of the revenue in the market associated with the businesses that are now left was lost and only a portion was retained and I would argue both of that what we\u2019ve been able to move from the Showboat over to our other properties which has gone relatively well. Atlantic City has continued to be a top. We\u2019ll have to watch what happens as we move into the typically seasonally very tough periods in the next quarter this quarter and next and see how it goes up. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. My last question\u2026 Gary Loveman : But the issue now for some time has been trips. Trips has remained strong and in fact has grown. So the problem with soft revenues as we\u2019ve experienced is it\u2019s been almost entirely Trip driven and in the market that have been more buoyant you\u2019ve seen stabilization in trip counts and in some cases improvement which has been encouraging. Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that\u2019s fantastic. Thank you very much. Gary Loveman : Thanks, Shaun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Hi, thank you good afternoon and congratulations to Eric and Donald. Donald Colvin : Thank you. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: I wanted to start I guess can you give a little bit more details with regards to the expense cuts going forward I know you are articulated the math and I was wondering if you could help us with some of the line items? Gary Loveman : Sue I will do a little bit of this and then Donald and Eric can elaborate. Much of this comes from a realization on my part and others that there were certain activities built into this company\u2019s central operating strategy that are no longer as persuasive as they were years ago. Much of what we have done has been premised on the idea that you can influence guest behavior at the margin through sophisticated stimulants and inducements that cause customers to move business our direction or take incremental trips. We have founded with the type of markets we\u2019ve been experiencing outside of Las Vegas and I want to emphasize this important caveat, outside of Las Vegas it has become very tough to do this profitably. So what you are seeing is the reduction in a lot of activity in marketing and in certain corporate areas where staff has been reduced to give up the effort to try to do this kind of work in many instances. So this would include for example the cessation of a lot of advertising and stimulation in Atlantic city in the off peak periods of this quarter and next, reduction in advertising in certain cases, reduction in what we are trying to do with methods applied to how we optimize the slot for. So you should interpret this to be a reduction in the scope of activity that the centralized office takes on rather than marginal reductions in the number of people doing existing patterns of work. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great. Gary Loveman : I should add Sue there are also some modifications and compensation practices and activities that you would expect during this period that will reduce cost in all three of the operating entities. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay great. And can you talk about I know you outlined Tunica reserve despite the casino closure, should we be expecting that you guys will look to close additional casinos going forward? Gary Loveman : Only where the market suggest that that\u2019s essential, remember in both of these cases in Tunica and in Atlantic City you had markets that had years of sustained decline and we operated more than one outfit in each place and where we have certain properties that did very well like Horseshoe Tunica and others that struggled with very high cost structure like Horseshoe Tunica very profitable, Harrah\u2019s Tunica very high cost, not very profitable. So the arbitrage opportunity there was evident, similarly in Atlantic City. It\u2019s not clear that we have others where that dynamic applies but we will certainly monitor the case to see if we find them. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Great. I just had two more housekeeping, I was wondering I am little confused with the presentation with regard to the CERP revolver. So it\u2019s at $75 million, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was drawn or LCs or if you can just kind of go over that? Donald Colvin : Yes it\u2019s drawn Sue. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. So went up from $35 million last quarter. Donald Colvin : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And then lastly with regards to CapEx any changes at any of the entities? Gary Loveman : Well, there are changes perspectively as the level of activity that we have experienced recently has been historically very high. So with the completion of the late, a big chunk of the renovation of what used to known as the Quad concluded, the amount of CapEx we anticipate for next year will be very substantially below what it\u2019s been the last couple of years. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: But I guess the \u2013 sorry go ahead Eric. Eric Hession : The only thing I would mention that may have changed in your model Sue is the spending on the convention center for in Atlantic City with respect to CERP. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. But with regard to CapEx we should still keep that 430 to 420? Eric Hession : Yes. Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Farber with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi guys how are you? Gary Loveman : Very well. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on CERP and then a couple of others as well. In CERP the pipeline continues to be pretty solid but the flow through was somewhat of a drag. I was just curious to hear your thoughts on sort of what\u2019s driving that if you expect that to normalize and if so when? And then a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Donald Colvin : Yes David you are exactly right the flow-throughs were disappointing and that is driven largely by the cost associated with the startup of several of the new assets that are brought online within CERP. So we have experienced abnormally heavy marketing spend to initiate attention on our guest part to these new offerings and many of them operated at margins that are below what we believe they will operate in the very near future. So I think these will moderate quickly. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Understood and in the last call you sounded optimistic that CERP would see some EBITDA growth in sometime. I guess I\u2019m just curious to hear how do you think these properties are positioned going into the next 12 to 18 months and specifically on the [Rio] and the LINQ you sort of highlighted how those were doing in the last call and I was just curious if you can give an update there. Gary Loveman : I think they continued to do very well. They have required more marketing expenditure than I would have first imagined to get people familiar with the offerings and when they\u2019re available and clarify exactly what the offerings and how they priced and so on. So my level of enthusiasm for this in the performance that experienced remain positive flow through in the introductory period has been a little bit weaker than I anticipated but I guess having thought about it a little more, it\u2019s not too surprising as these things are really quite novel in the city and it\u2019s taken more than I would originally imagined to acquaint everyone with them. The rest of the assets if you recall the composition of these assets are very strong. They are well located very well branded businesses, principally in Las Vegas. Atlantic City no matter what happen to the Atlantic City will be one of the survivors and will benefit from the new convection center when it\u2019s concluded and then there is the lawful business in Nevada which continues to do very, very well. So the CERP properties I think have a very bright future and the cost reductions I\u2019ve mentioned in my remarks will flow through very capably the CERP and I think you\u2019ll see some significant improvement there. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : That\u2019s helpful and on other side of house you guys ended the quarter about $1.5 billion of cash. I was just hoping here any updated thoughts and if company intends to stay current on its obligations with a large coupon payment in December and I was a little unclear on the prepared remarks you mentioned whether you would be disclosing additional information on the Q or any just sort of remind me on the delay with the Q. Thanks. Gary Loveman : I am afraid you walked through the militarized zone David. But you do it with such a deft hand intonation in your questions that if one were not really paying attention you could easily be let in. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Understood and on the Q is the implication there will be new information disclosed in the Q. Is that what you were saying in the prepared remarks? Gary Loveman : No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find any quote new information that is to say. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see reporting on categories of activity or measures different than what you would expect in the typical Q. David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. Okay and then last one and then I\u2019ll hop out. Can you guys just categorize maybe do it offline if you feel, but just sort of same store trends at CEOC given a lot of noise including hold and bad debt. You guys have that number just on a year-over-year basis given all the moving pieces that will be pretty helpful. Thanks. Donald Colvin : I\u2019m not sure, we\u2019re going to be able to do that when on the fly. Obviously the same store numbers, these are powerful quite core, because of the very poor hold that we experienced. My quick reaction and this is speculation on my part the same store numbers were much better outside of Caesar\u2019s though. But why don\u2019t you pick that up with Eric and Jeff? David Farber \u2013 Credit Suisse : Will do thanks. Gary Loveman : Thank you, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Kayler with Bank of America. Your line is open. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. How are you doing? Gary Loveman : Good. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good, a little slow on the drive base, all the good questions are taken. I just one housing thing on the, going back to the cash balance at CEOC at $1.5 billion. So it\u2019s down about $670 million from the June quarter by my calculation. Can you just give us some of the components of where the cash went sequentially? Donald Colvin : Yeah again James I don\u2019t have the full bridge in front of me but it was of course coupon payments for the debt and the various instruments, refinancings, adviser fees all types of costs associated with the restructuring efforts and then the CapEx spending for the quarter as well would have offset the EBITDA that was generated by the properties. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and then maybe coming at it from a different direction what is the sort of minimum cash balance you need at CEOC? Eric Hession : It\u2019s about between 130 to 180 depending on the different property levels. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : 130 to 180 million of cash. Eric Hession : Cash. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. In AC with the closure of the Showboat, can you just talk about your success in sort of retaining those customers within the broader portfolio through\u2026? Gary Loveman : Yeah, I will happy to. So as I indicated in my remarks if you look at aggregate revenue levels in the markets that these facilities were close [inaudible] as well as Showboat, the market has lost a lot of that revenue. We are in a little bit better spot with respect to transparency of what happen to Showboat revenue because of course we track the individual guest, person by person and see what\u2019s become of their activity and their anticipated future presentation. So we feel very strongly that we will recovery well over half of the revenue and as much as two-thirds or three quarter of the trips of the Showboat guest within our system. Now we have had to spend some money to do that because these are guests that over a long period of time selected Showboat as their preferred location and we are now having to reintroduce them to Harrah\u2019s, Caesar\u2019s and [Bally\u2019s] and encourage them to come and see us. That has been a costly and a little bit more costly than I would have anticipated undertaking. Though I think it was money well-spent and will amortize itself favorably over the coming quarters. So I am quite optimistic about the retention of the Showboat guest business in our other places. I am little less optimistic about the retention of the revenues of the non-Caesar\u2019s properties that close over the period. James Kayler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right \u2013 oops sorry fire alarm I guess give me one second, can you just give us an update on New York when you think it might be a license might be awarded and what your guys prospects are? I am going to leave now, thank you. Gary Loveman : Okay. If there was a fire I hope it was of natural causes and not us. With respect New York we anticipate \u2013 we don\u2019t know for sure but we anticipate that will be some decision with respect to licenses by the end of November. Operator we will turn to the last guest who is not suffering from sort of fire safety emergency. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and coagulations to Eric once again. Just a quick question on the $20 million of bad debt expense at CEOC. Eric can you just confirm was that added back or not added back to EBITDA reconciliation? Eric Hession : It\u2019s a charge to EBITDA, not added back. Donald Colvin : Yeah, and also Kevin, there was some favorability from prior year and then this period was consistent with other periods, so was just on the year-over-year basis that you would\u2026 Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay\u2026 Gary Loveman : $20 billion it was year-on-year Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Gary you mentioned 37,000 [room block] committed and the tender for another 37,000, are these all booked at the CERP property in Atlantic City? Gary Loveman : Yes, they are booked at Harrah\u2019s. So as we \u2013 this new connection meeting center we are selling it to very large degree to customers of ours from Mid-Atlantic City to Las Vegas we now have an opportunity for them to hold their meeting closer to the home. We have got very nice reaction to that but the room block is entirely inherent rather than asking the [inaudible] to make their way over to the room block. Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just a follow-up on the statement where in the regional markets you think cut expenses and increase EBITDA by the $250 million to $300 million. I was just wondering when you stressed your model did you use let\u2019s say flat top line growth or does that assume any top line growth in that exercise. Gary Loveman : It does not assume any top line growth outside of Las Vegas. Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. But does it include let\u2019s say negative growth like when you cut marketing and advertising that you will see decline in core revenue? Gary Loveman : Yes, but only marginal because we believe that much of this \u2013 some of this marketing will now be discontinued has had relatively little effect on revenue. Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Gary Loveman : So there was an assumption of some lost revenue but not substantial lost revenue. Donald Colvin : The only other thing I\u2019d clarify Kevin just to make sure that it is clear the 320 to 300 is companywide so it\u2019s not purely a regional property estimate. Kevin Coyne \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you very much. Gary Loveman : Thank you Kevin. Operator I think that concludes our questions. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Gary Loveman : Thanks everyone for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, let me turn it over to Gary. Gary Loveman : Thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today. The fourth quarter was an encouraging period for Caesars Entertainment. The company\u2019s performance benefited from improvements in activity levels and expense management across the network, increasing revenues associated with our investments in hospitality, particularly in Las Vegas and recovery in markets where we have addressed structural cost issues, specifically Atlantic City and Tunica, Mississippi. Overall, revenue increased 6% from the prior year. While activity at the beginning of the quarter was sluggish, overall revenue performance has been improving sequentially since November. December and January were especially positive, resulting from better revenue performance across the network. Top-line growth in the fourth quarter was driven by very strong results at Caesars Interactive, coupled with the addition of Horseshoe Baltimore, the High Roller, and the Cromwell all of which opened in 2014. Our investments in recent years to enhance and expand hospitality offerings also contributed to the gains in revenue. However, similar to last quarter, unfavorable hold at Caesars Palace to the tune of over $60 million year-over-year and higher start-up costs from new properties as well as new food and beverage offerings, and some increases in corporate expenses offset the top-line growth we experienced in these areas. During the fourth quarter, we began to experience the benefits of our restructuring in Atlantic City and Tunica. EBITDA in Atlantic City has begun a steady climb after being marginally profitable in the fourth quarter of last year; while in Tunica we have seen EBITDA increase roughly 60%, from the prior year period. Since 2008, the company has implemented a series of cost management initiatives and operational improvements to address the challenging conditions that we face in our industry since the financial crisis. Through these efforts, we have extracted significant costs without sacrificing service levels. Considering where the industry is today and to ensure strong EBITDA flow throughs from top-line growth going forward, we remain relentless in our efforts in these areas. During the fourth quarter, we began implementing additional measures across the enterprise to ensure the company\u2019s expense base is appropriately sized for the current dynamics in the industry. We have focused our efforts on reducing costs that we have determined that no longer yield significant incremental revenue. Among the steps we have taken has been the discontinuation of non-essential contract services, improving property level costs through process enhancements such as more sophisticated scheduling and the elimination of certain management layers. Additionally, we are working to reduce marketing expenses in circumstances where our analytics suggest that such reductions will have little impact on customer behavior and revenue. As a result of these efforts, we realized approximately $9 million of cost savings in the fourth quarter, but we expect the real benefits from these efforts will be seen beginning in the first quarter of this year. Across the 2015 year, we expect to produce an incremental $250 million to $300 million of EBITDA as a result of cost savings and EBITDA enhancing initiatives. The majority of our planned initiatives have already been implemented and we anticipate robust flow through prospectively. Before I dive into the details and highlights across the three entities that comprise Caesars Entertainment, I would like to first discuss the developments related to CEOC\u2019s restructuring efforts. As you all know, on January 15th CEOC voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to facilitate a restructuring of its capital structure. CEOC entered into a restructuring support agreement with more than 80% of its first lien bondholders. Caesars Entertainment Corporation is not part of the filing nor is Caesars Growth Partners or Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties. During this process, all of Caesars Entertainment properties, including those owned or managed by CEOC, are open for business and will continue to operate in the normal course. This action marks the culmination of efforts to improve CEOC's balance sheet, which has included substantial investment in new and upgraded hospitality assets, particularly in Las Vegas, Caesars Palace. The financial restructuring for CEOC is part of a comprehensive plan to strengthen CEOC and all of Caesars Entertainment and position them for sustainable, long-term growth and value creation. The details of the plan entail moving CEOC\u2019s real estate into a publicly traded REIT. The properties will be leased for an annual lease payment of $635 million, which will be guaranteed by CEC and managed by the operating company, which CEC will control and be the majority equity owner. As is currently the case, and continuing following the restructuring, all properties will continue to be part of the Caesars Entertainment network and will continue to benefit from the same brands, centralized services and access to Total Rewards. To facilitate a smooth restructuring, Caesars Entertainment Corporation has agreed to make significant contributions to benefit CEOC and its creditors. In addition, a significant step in the overall restructuring is the completion of the previously announced merger of Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company. Not only will this merger further simplify our capital structure and drive expense savings, it will also facilitate CEC's contributions without the need for significant third-party financing. Additionally, the strength of the merged company will position it to be a strong guarantor of the CEOC lease payment. If successful, the plan will reduce CEOC's debt by approximately $10 billion and decrease its annual interest expense from approximately $1.7 billion to approximately $450 million with a vastly improved cash flow profile. The REIT structure is a highly efficient vehicle and has been gaining traction in the gaming and hospitality industry as evidenced by Penn Gaming's REIT conversion in 2013 and the announcement by several others in our industry of exploring such a move, including our friends at Pinnacle Entertainment and Boyd Gaming. We believe the plan will enable CEOC to maximize value and substantially improve financial recoveries to each creditor group while maintaining the integrity of Caesars Entertainment\u2019s multi-channel distribution network. Upon completion of the merger and restructuring, Caesars Entertainment will be a financially stronger company with significantly reduced leverage and a much simpler and straightforward corporate structure. As alternative restructuring paths would likely have greater costs and higher risks, it remains CEC and CEOC's goal for there to be a consensual agreement with all of CEOC's various lender constituents on its restructuring plan. A consensual deal would reduce costly litigation, provide for a quicker restructuring process, minimize any potential disruption to the business and provide the best recovery for all creditors. The REIT transaction merger are subject to gaming regulatory approvals and the restructuring plan must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. CEOC is focused on obtaining approvals for each of these and intends to move this process forward as quickly as possible so that CEOC can emerge from Chapter 11 in a timely manner. Now let me move on to review our fourth quarter performance. First, at Caesars Entertainment Report Properties, revenue increased 8% over the prior year, driven primarily by hospitality amenities in Las Vegas and improved performance in Atlantic City. Flow through, however, remained challenged as recently opened dining outlets continue to ramp up, impacting margins. Additionally, CERP had higher corporate and overhead expenses in the quarter. New marketing initiatives have broadened customer awareness and visitation to The LINQ and High Roller as well as to the Flamingo and Harrah\u2019s. These properties experienced increases in gaming volumes attributable to their proximity to the promenade. The wheel experienced increased ridership from the third quarter of this year. Overall, the LINQ performance was broadly consistent with prior quarters, but we had some one-time charge-offs related to the optimization of the tenant mix. In Atlantic City, we are particularly encouraged by the level of bookings at the meetings facility adjacent to Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. Reservations for meetings have been steadily growing and outpacing our expectations. With the key booking period still ahead of us, we are very thrilled with where the business stands today. As of the 1st of this year, January 1st, the facility has booked 62,000 room nights for the first 12-month period following its expected opening in the third quarter in 2015. Turning now to Caesars Growth Partners, the entity reported another great quarter with revenues up 46% to $527 million. CGP\u2019s results were attributable to exceptional performance at CIE, primarily from social and mobile games, the openings of The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore and increased revenue from hospitality amenities. CIE continues to be a shining star with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increasing 87% year-over-year on revenue growth of 64%. This performance was driven by the acquisition of Pacific Interactive in early 2014, plus continued organic growth in the business and contributions from real money online gaming. During the quarter, CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business grew paying customer users to $657,000 and average revenue per user increased year-over-year to $0.28 as a result of the team\u2019s efforts to drive greater monetization of its user base. With respect to real money online gaming, we continue to look for ways to attract new customers and grow the business. For example, in January of this year, WSOP.com and 888 Poker, which is CIE\u2019s platform provider in New Jersey, began partial pooling of players in the state to increase liquidity. As we have stated before regarding the online gaming sector, we intend to continue capitalizing on new opportunities in existing and potential new states as they emerge. On the brick-and-mortar side of the business, Growth Partners\u2019 casino properties also delivered good results with revenue up 40% year-over-year to $371 million, primarily due to the openings of the Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. Non-gaming revenue growth was attributable to the opening of Drai\u2019s and Giada at The Cromwell earlier this year, continued strong hotel revenues from the renovated Jubilee Tower at Bally\u2019s, and new dining and entertainment options across all of Growth Partners\u2019 properties. Adjusted EBITDA, however, decreased 3% to $60 million, as Growth Partners incurred additional expenses in the fourth quarter of this year that did not occur in the prior year comparison. These costs included general operating expenses associated with The Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore, which opened in the second and third quarters, respectively. The strip-front lease expense at the LINQ Hotel, which began in the first quarter of '14, management fees that were paid to CEOC for the purchased properties and overhead expenses related to Caesars Enterprise Services, which commenced in the third quarter of 2014. Performance at The LINQ Hotel & Casino was impacted by 1,250 rooms that were out of service due to the ongoing renovation there. The project is proceeding as planned and we expect these rooms to be returned to service in the first half of this year. The renovated rooms that have already come back online have performed exceedingly well, generating a 47% cash ADR premium compared to the historical ADR in Q4 of 2013. Turning now to CEOC, as we noted on our last call, Caesars Palace faced tough comparisons this quarter due to extremely favorable hold in the second half of 2013. Compounding the comparison to the favorable hold in 2013, this year we experienced nearly unprecedented poor hold. In total, hold at Caesars Palace amounted to an approximately $60 million year-over-year impact on Q4 EBITDA. On a positive note, I am delighted to report that the law of large numbers continues to work, so far in the first quarter it appears our luck has started to normalize with respect to hold. Looking forward at Caesars Palace, the imminent opening of Omnia Nightclub will further add to our selection of premier entertainment options and attract guests to our flagship property. The club opens March 12 with an impressive lineup of award winning global electronic music artists, including DJ Calvin Harris on opening night. We are also eagerly anticipating the launch of Mariah Carey\u2019s residence at the Colosseum in early May. Away from Las Vegas, as I noted earlier, we are pleased by the stability in same-store regional markets, which have performed flat to up in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. Since November, excluding Caesars Palace, the other CEOC properties have generated improved revenue growth, driven by good gaming volumes and slightly favorable hold with strength being broad based across geographies. In particular, Tunica and Atlantic City have delivered healthier revenue and EBITDA. Let me say that again, in case you are hallucinating, In particular, Tunica and Atlantic City have delivered healthier revenue and EBITDA performance stemming from the adjustments we recently made to our cost structure. With the exception of an increase in VLT supply in Illinois, which has been a big challenge, there is no significant new supply expected to come online in CEOC\u2019s regional markets in 2015. We are optimistic about the slowing declines and signs of growth in certain markets. We expect ongoing stability in the regions coupled with our vigilance in reducing costs to drive improvement in CEOC\u2019s 2015 EBITDA to our now expected $1.024 billion plan. As mentioned previously, the majority of the increase in 2015 EBITDA is expected to be predominately driven by cost savings, with an incremental $165 to $200 million of CEOC EBITDA in 2015, coming from a variety of identified initiatives in operations, marketing and corporate expenses. On the international development front, we are making good progress on the design phase of our South Korea project and will begin the permitting process in the coming months. With Chinese visitation to Korea growing by over 40% this past year, we are very excited about the prospects for our Korea project. Now, let me hand it over to Eric to review consolidated financial performance for the fourth quarter. Eric Hession : Thanks, Gary. Fourth quarter consolidated net revenues increased 6% from the prior year to $2.1 billion, primarily due to growth in the social and mobile games at CIE, the opening of new properties that Gary previously referred to and the opening of new food and beverage outlets. Casino revenues rose 2%, mainly against the addition of Horseshoe Baltimore casino opening. Excluding Baltimore, regional markets experienced sequential improved visitation from both, VIP and non-VIP guests in the fourth quarter, with VIP guests showing an absolute increase on a year-over-year perspective. January performance also shows encouraging signs that this sequential improvement has continued into 2015. Room revenue increased 5% as fewer available room nights at The LINQ Hotel & Casino, due to renovations were more than offset by a 14% increase in cash ADR. Overall RevPAR increased 9%, led by an 11% growth in RevPAR at Las Vegas. Group revenue increased 12% with margin expansion leading to a 19% growth in profit versus the prior year. We are particularly excited about the year ahead when it comes to group business. 2015 is positioned well with the group business expected to grow in the high-single digits year-over-year. Contracted business for 2016 is positive as well, with strength in both Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Fourth quarter food and beverage revenue was 9% higher relative to the prior year, due to the opening of several new restaurants in Las Vegas, notably Giada at The Cromwell and the outlets at the Horseshoe Baltimore casino. Other revenue increased 34% year-over-year, due to strong growth in social and mobile games at CIE and third-party rent and entertainment revenue from The LINQ and High Roller as well as Britney Spears' Piece of Me show at Planet Hollywood. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined 8% to $372 million, which was attributable to the impact of poor hold, as Gary referenced higher property operating costs, driven by the openings of the new outlets and increased corporate overhead expenses. Turning now to our bank account cash, cage cash and available revolver capacity, CERP had $279 million at the end of the quarter. This was comprised of $189 million in cage cash and bank account cash as well as $90 remaining capacity remaining on the CERP revolver. CGP ended the quarter with $1.094 billion, $944 million of which was in cash and cash equivalents with the remaining $150 million available on the CGPH revolver.  Similarly, CEOC had $1.194 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the year. Subsequent to the fourth quarter, we announced that our venture partner Rock Ohio has entered into an agreement with Caesars Entertainment operating company to redeem our 20% minority interest in Rock. Caesars will continue to manage the Horseshoe Cleveland and Cincinnati casinos as well as Thistledown Racetrack and all properties will remain a part of the Caesars\u2019 Total Rewards network. Lastly, before turning it back to Gary, I would like to note a change you should expect to see in our press release and consolidated financial statements beginning next quarter. Given CEOC\u2019s Chapter 11 filing on January 15, 2015, beginning with the first quarter of 2015, CEC will deconsolidate its investment in CEOC and its subsidiaries. Gary? Gary Loveman : Thanks, Eric. While the fourth quarter was encouraging on many levels, EBITDA was negatively impacted by a series of items, including particularly unfavorable hold, ongoing construction disruption, higher start-up costs related to new food and beverage offerings and some increased corporate expenses. EBITDA has improved during the period since November, however, and we are pleased with the sequential improvement in key business indicators across our network. Coupled with the top-line benefits we are realizing from our hospitality investments and our focus to improve flow through and enhance cash flow generation. I am really quite optimistic about 2015 as we see a clear pathway to stronger results. Additionally, for the upcoming year, we will be very engaged with the execution of CEOC's restructuring plan and the Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition merger, so that we can complete this process as quickly and efficiently as possible and realize additional cost savings to restore the health and long-term viability of CEOC. Combined, we believe these actions will provide a platform to grow and prosper for many years to come. With a track forward to ensure the future prosperity of Caesars Entertainment, I felt this is an appropriate time for a transition in management. I will step down as CEO of Caesars Entertainment on June 30th, after serving in this position for the last 12 years. During this time, I have seen this company evolve and accomplish more than I could have imagined when I began. I am extremely proud of the team, all that we have achieved and how well prepared they are and we are for the future. I will continue to oversee the restructuring of CEOC, remaining Chairman of this entity as well as of Chairman of Caesars Entertainment. Mark Frissora, my successor has been appointed CEO designee, and subject to regulatory approval will take over as CEO July 1st. He has also joined our Board. Mark and I will work closely together to ensure a seamless transition and a productive start beginning on his first day. We have an excellent team available to lead this company at all levels and I am confident that Mark, working together with me and the rest of the management, will execute effectively on the initiatives underway to position Caesars for future growth and success. We are about to open the call to questions, but before we do so let me just say that you all know I would that you may have questions regarding the status of the restructuring process or the state of our discussions with various creditors. However, we will not be able to answer and discuss these questions due to the ongoing sensitive nature of the negotiations proceedings and associated litigation. Operator that concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hi. Thank you. Congratulations, Gary. Gary Loveman : Thank you. Susan Berliner : I want to the start on the CERP if I may. I was wondering if you guys could go into a little bit of the expenses. It seemed like they were quite elevated again this quarter. Eric Hession : Yes, Sure, Sue. I will start and then see if Gary or Jackie wants to add anything. There were number of items that impacted the flow-through from the CERP perspective. As we referenced the LINQ and Wheel, continued to perform within the expectations that we had, and consistent with prior year period, however we did take a charge of approximately $8 million with respect to the transition that we have made with some of the tenants in the facility and that would have impacted the flow-through from the CERP credit perspective. In addition, we did reference the increase in the PG&E and corporate expense. There are a number of items that are driving that, but from the perspective of the CERP credit, a lot of them have to do with overall professional services associated with the just the overall complexity of the various capital structures and making sure that the CERP reporting high is [ph] complete. As we also talked about going forward, we anticipate significant efficiency to be generated as part of the cost program that we will be both, at the property level through the efficiency Gary mentioned, but as well at the corporate level. Those would flow-through to CERP credit and we anticipate improving margins throughout the year in 2015. Gary Loveman : Sue, this is Gary. I and Eric did a very nice job of elaborating on the sources of these various costs. They are obviously quite the frustrating to us. The two big contributors to this were the low yields associated with the revenues generated at these new outlooks, the cost of the write-off associated with the movement of a couple tenants at LINQ. Then also these very high professional expenses that are the result of the complexity and this structure that we currently operate on. Jennifer Chen : One thing you will have to remember that CERP itself now has its registrant, so leading up to that filing next year there is significant work on that end to facilitate that? Susan Berliner : I guess I am confused by a couple of things. I guess the movement of a couple of tenants, does that mean tenants left and others were replaced or what exactly does that mean? Eric Hession : Yes. I means that when you a bring a lot of new tenants in to a new development like this, some of them do very well and some of them do less well than they had hoped and you wind up having to do some re-assortment I would call it. There are often times some cost associated with that. Susan Berliner : I just want a clarification on other point you brought up with regards to the complexity of the balance sheet. Is it the CERP debt kind of its own entity? Eric Hession : I think that point that Jackie just made much more particularly than I did. There is just a lot additional professional services work which is required to support these entities, so CERP had some incremental cost that we don't see repeating themselves in the future. Susan Berliner : Great. I just had two other questions with regards to CERP. With regards to CapEx spend on the convention centre. Can you just give us what you spent this quarter and what has been spend here thus far on the project? Eric Hession : Yes. Sure, Sue. As you know the budget is approximately $125 million. That is net of the amounts that we will get back from the incentives CRDA incentives and we spent approximately $56 million at this point. The balance we would expect to come over this year and some of it might actually extend into next year due to the timing related to the overall construction project. Susan Berliner : Great. Then my last question how to do with. I was surprised on the draw on the CERP revolver. I know you kept it in cash, but can you just articulate your strategy with regards to cash and the revolver? Eric Hession : Yes. There is significant amount cash at the CERP entity itself. A piece of that is obviously cage cashes you are aware and then there was cash associated with simply working capital fluctuations. We wanted to make sure that we had a sufficient amount of cash to cover those fluctuations, so we have drawn on the revolver when needed for various expenses. Susan Berliner : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Sorry. Eric Hession : Go ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kevin Coyne : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to ask a question on the Caesars Palace, I know the hold was a negative variance, was there any change in terms of your use or your terms of the casino credit, which may have contributed to that change or was it solely just luck of the draw? Eric Hession : Just luck of the draw. Sadly not too many people had to use casino credit under the. Kevin Coyne : Okay. Eric Hession : We allocated it well. Kevin Coyne : I was just wondering going back to CERP, do you have the number of how many passengers who used the Wheel this past quarter? Eric Hession : Yes. It was just shy of approximately 5,000 a day. That was up around 10% quarter-over-quarter on a sequential basis, so we continue to see improvements. We saw exceptionally strong demand during the holiday period at the end of the year when there is a sizable component of FIT business in town and we saw some record days at that point. Then take the average ticket price has also held up and been broadly consistent with that be achieved in the third quarter. Gary Loveman : Yes. Kevin, this is Gary. I would just add, I am very excited about how the Wheel is doing. I am also fascinated by how complicated it is. Marketing attraction at different days and different times and different days under different weather conditions, different holiday patterns has proven to be a very rich assignment and my colleagues are loading a lot and doing it well and better and I think the upside in this attraction is considerable. We are happy with buy-sell's writers, we can do a lot more and there are days when we do 75% more than that. I think, there is tremendous additional benefit to be added from the Wheel. Kevin Coyne : Would you say you are getting the corporate business and the group business that you planned on or is there still upside from that channel? Gary Loveman : There is a lot of upside. We have not had much corporate business as we originally had anticipated. We have made a much more deliberate effort to build that business and we have seen it come on very nicely here just in the last few weeks, so I think there is a lot of potential for that in the future? Eric Hession : I think one thing to add just to that dynamic is that the group business tend to book farther out and in terms of a convention planner signing up for the event the Wheel, they want to see the Wheel operating and have gone an experience, so we are starting to see some of those bookings roll in. I also think that a primary area of opportunity for us is the tour and travel. Again, the pamphlets and the information that is printed for that segment of the business is done annually. Again, it takes time to get that absorbed in to the various cycles of the groups that come to town. Those areas are certainly areas of opportunity as we go through 2015. Kevin Coyne : Great. Maybe I can just turn to the regional markets for one moment. I know a lot of casino operators have gotten this question in terms of the lower gas prices perhaps you can just comment on, do you think that is providing any lift whether it would be fourth quarter or subsequent to fourth quarter and maybe you can segment that perhaps it is helping the lower end of the segment more on a percentage basis in terms of a recovery? Gary Loveman : This is Gary. What we would have to think that is helping although might be hard for us to prove it to you from what we have seen so far. Hopefully if gas prices remained somewhere near where they been, we will have a sustained benefit to the liquidity of our customers that will see a benefit, but I think perhaps the best news out of these areas is then the stabilization of the supply dynamics. As you have also seen all of my friends and competitors poured a lot of attention to their costs, I think that is a favorable pattern for the industry broadly, so you have seen a lot of margin improvement from my regional colleague I think that bodes well. Kevin Coyne : Kevin Coyne : Great. Just one final one, just as it relates to CERP and I am not going to ask question on the restructuring, but down the road could you envision CERP eventually becoming part of the REIT subsidiary or is there anything from a regulatory standpoint that would prohibit that from happening? Eric Hession : I do not think there is anything that would be prohibited with regulatory becomes a strategic decision for the company as to whether it wishes to hold those assets or put them into the structures we have suggested for the assets under the restructuring plan. I think that awaits further discussion down the road. There are certainly no immediate plans for that. Kevin Coyne : Thank you. Eric Hession : Thank you, Kevin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Farber from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. David Farber : Hi, guys. How are you? Eric Hession : Hi, David David Farber : Congrats, Gary. We will miss you. Gary Loveman : Thank you. David Farber : I had a couple of questions. I want it to first touch on the CEOC. You discussed in your prepared remarks about some of the cost savings efforts and even talked about the EBITDA plan you had underwritten a little bit, so I just be curious to hear how you think about the figure if it is attainable, is it conservative, if it is aggressive given the fourth quarter? What you are seeing currently just from a fundamental perspective at the CEOC box then a couple follows up in there? Thanks. Gary Loveman : I will take a shot at this. Then my colleagues can revise it as needed. We feel that the numbers are quite attainable. We have sign on to these numbers with our board. Now, with all of you through announcing the EBITDA number for CERP for the year, you could imagine these have been a part of the restructuring discussions as well. We have a lot of financial apparatus in place to measure the progress of the cost initiatives as they provide. My colleague, under Eric's administration look after the attainment of the operating cost structures that each entity here queue [ph] order for these numbers to attain. Through now what is eight or nine weeks of the beginning of the year, we feel very good about where we are headed. As you could imagine, some do a little better, some do a little worse than one might expected. Some new ones are first some other were retired, but the progress along the line with the numbers we provided I think are quite encouraging. David Farber : Very good. Just a follow up to that, so should a successful restructuring come together, I guess, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of CapEx on the less levered balance sheet and how you think about maybe the shape of the regional properties? Do you feel like you need a good amount capital? Any thoughts there and then I just have two follow up. Thanks. Gary Loveman : I am going to say a word about the need for capital and Eric will give those then Jacquie could give you those specifics. I feel like the regional assets were in reasonably good shape given the state of these markets and the level of our competitors' facilities. If you take all those important regional facility of Horseshoe Hammond, it remains the premier asset and the market is very good shape. It continues to outperform second point [ph] competitor by a very wide margins sometimes double. I think in many of these instances, we feel very good about it. The same would apply Horseshoe Tunica versus Bossier City for example. The place where we have always said we have some catch up to do on CapEx as bigger in Las Vegas. Caesars has been a large recipient of capital year-over- year, so has largely been in the CERP and CGP assets, not so much the CEOC assets of Las Vegas, so I do think there we have had some catching up to do and plans are underway to address that. Eric, you want to go through those two? Eric Hession : Yes. Just from a dollars prospective, David. This year we are planning to spend approximately $300 million on CEOC CapEx. That would include some hotel rooms here at Caesars Palace that we feel make a lot of sense to do at this point given the dynamics in the market and particularly with omni opening up and demand for that type of products going forward though I think you will see more around the range of that we have consistently been and talk about which is in that 225-plus or minus range and that would be sufficient to maintain all the assets. Again, as we talked about before, there are certain where we feel we are ahead of the curve in terms of the maintenance such as our slot product, where we replaced all the video poker last year. Then we have talked about a few hotel room projects that needed to be done and it is a balance between them, but that is kind of probably where we are thinking. David Farber : Very good. That is helpful. Just in Las Vegas, starting to see at least some outperformance maybe on the slot side versus the tables, so just curious sort of in the Caesars' portfolio what assets or properties you think is best positioned for this when the construction disruption is going to end in Las Vegas. Then I just had one last question on CERP if I may? Thanks. Eric Hession : Taking those in turn, the construction disruption is largely starting to falloff essentially. We opened the bazaar shops in front of Bally's few days ago. The Cromwell as you know is under construction for significant portion of last year and that has been open now for a little while. The LINQ is open and the wheel is running. Then the LINQ hotel is the main area that is still under construction in our let's say east side property. The hotel rooms are expected to come back online starting in March, and they should all be back online in May, so we will have full complement of rooms at that point. As you know, we have been operating essentially with half capacity for the last 9 months to 12 months or so. On the west side with Caesars Palace, omni is opening at the end of this month middle of the end of this month as well as with the Seersucker Restaurant towards the end of the month and that will really clean up the front of the building as you have seen there have been a lot of traffic disruptions there and pedestrian traffic as well. We are very excited about omni opening. We think it is going to drive tremendous amount of business to the property. From slot versus table perspective, I do not think there is really a clear-cut trend at this point with respect to Las Vegas at Caesars Palace we are obviously watching the ultra high-end international business components, but that really does not manifest itself in any of the other properties on this trip, Jackie. Jackie Beato : Yes. I mean, the only think I would say about the bar transit, we did see here in Las Vegas a pickup in our slot business here in the Las Vegas market. As you can imagine, our more traditional gaming properties like Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas, Bally's Las Vegas to be the one that benefit most from that, whereas Eric referenced on those international high-end business is mostly table games business. David Farber : Very good. That is helpful. Eric, if you did that off the top of your head, the construction disruption, I am very impressed. Just quickly on CERP, we talked a little bit about the OpEx. I think Sue asked the question, but can you talk a little bit about the potential for the Harrah's Atlantic City and Laughlin sale as you have disclosed in the past and any thoughts around the use of proceeds, should you go through with that transaction, if you could talk to that, either way that is it for me. Thanks. Gary Loveman : I do not think that anything has changed on the option for as a function of this restructuring process for Harrah's Atlantic City in Laughlin to be moved into a REIT. That remains a subject to discussion in the restructuring and we have - contemplate use of proceeds at this point. I can't resist going back to the question about slots through, I remain very concerned that the product is antiquated as a category and that our slot providers need to work harder to provide a foreign factor and gain content that is moderate. The feelings of my colleagues in CIE do that every day. They innovate remarkably rapidly test and improve their product and how it is enjoyed by their customers constantly and I [indiscernible] that with what our traditional supplier has done. I think there is tremendous opportunity there. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Dennis Farrell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gary Loveman : Hey, Dennis Dennis Farrell : Hey, Gary. Congratulations on a great career. I wanted to just start off with the cost savings program that you have announced, the $250 million to $300 million. One, I was kind of wondering, I mean, I feel like you have been cutting cost of the company since the recession and I am just kind of wondered how much cost have you pulled out or around ballpark number thus far out of Caesars? Then I just wondered of the $250 million to $300 million, how much of that was at CERP? Gary Loveman : We are reflecting here for a moment. Eric Hession : In aggregate, Dennis, when we add up the programs that we have initiated since the leverage buyout it is approximately $900 million in total. As we talked about the $250 million to $300 million that we anticipate getting in the new program consist as Gary noted in terms of refining our scheduling, making sure that we are more efficient at the properties as well as some de-layering from the management perspective in then the refinement of our marketing efforts. I would expect that the impact of that to the various credits would be proportionate based on the particular drivers, so to the extent that there are savings associated with efforts that are largely based on the property that CERP owned, you would expect savings from those. Those will be things that are heavily table games-centric as well as hotel properties are very large, all six of them, whereas some of the savings and efficiencies that we might gather from the more frequency markets would be predominantly CEOC basis. Gary Loveman : Let me add a couple cost savings. Obviously, you can't find $900 million of increment to EBITDA associated with the number Eric described, because we have had a lot of secular cost increases beating upstream into the system from negotiated union agreement, energy expenses in market and a variety of other increased expenses. The net of those cost savings against these headwinds we have had or what should be the results that you have seen. What is different about this round of cost reductions in my view are the bit pricing, they are a bit more ingenious for example Jacquie who is here with us, we negotiated much of our property and casualty insurance coverage in the last few weeks and it did so in a very thoughtful way that saved the company millions and millions of dollars, with very little increment to our risk profile. Favorable market has helped but that is a true benefit to the company with no consequence to the guests. Similarly, our Chief Marketing Officer, Tariq Shaukat thought a lot about these application of marketing expenses, in periods where our ability to influence consumer behavior is limited. For example in bad weather month in Atlantic City, where the risk of the marketing interventions being overrun by bad weather is high, we have cut a lot of these expenses back. At least so far it seems a very little effect on revenue generation. I think they are quite sophisticated modifications in the way we operate the business in response to the conditions we face with our guests, and so far they have shown no consequence on guest services. In fact, our trip activities we have reported remain strong and growing. Dennis Farrell : Okay. Great. Then in regards to RevPAR in Las Vegas, the resort fees have been raised around this strip? Are you raising your resort fee you are going to share? Gary Loveman : We do not know yet. Dennis Farrell : Okay. Gary Loveman : I like to think that we need to add some value to provide to the guest rather than simply raising the resort fees. So, we have recently enhanced the quality of the internet service, we provide. We have made other investments in the facilities and we will take a look at where our competitors are getting on resort fees and consider whether there is any modification. Dennis Farrell : Okay. Then moving over to CERP, just kind of looking at I was wondering what CapEx you think will kind of be around for 2015 and your thoughts on being able to be free cash flow positive. Obviously, if the cost savings programs kind of kick in, you will be free cash flow positive, but I am slightly concerned about the margin performance at CERP. I am hoping that you can really drive improvement there, especially given the leased, the benefits you got from the leases in this past year. Gary Loveman : I think there are reasons for optimism on margins at CERP as Eric indicated. Eric, you can give more specific on CapEx? Eric Hession : For 2015, Dennis, the CapEx including CERP's portion of the CES CapEx is going to range between $140 to $215 million\u2026 Dennis Farrell : $140 million to $215 million? Eric Hession : Yes. That includes the Atlantic City Convention Center, which is largest component of that. We also had some room renovation projects that we are planning to do here in Las Vegas, then some food and beverage as well as just general other maintenance projects. Dennis Farrell : I guess your liquidity with the cash pull down should be sufficient to fund all that. Correct? Eric Hession : Yes. That is right. As Gary mentioned, we do anticipate strong flow through heading into this year. As I called out, we had few events in the fourth quarter that we felt are one-time based and we would anticipate that 2015, the margin should get back to where you would normally expect a Las Vegas-centric credit to be. Gary Loveman : To the extent for whatever reason that fails to occur, we will moderate our capital [ph] we are just very carefully watching that process, but I think CERP's performance will improve substantially from where it has been. Dennis Farrell : Okay. What was total CapEx for CERP for 2014? Eric Hession : We will have to get back to you with it. We do not have that with us. Dennis Farrell : All right. No worries. Thank you very much. Gary Loveman : Thank you. Operator, I think that concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect",

Eric will now make some opening comments about the basis of our reporting before Gary speaks. Eric Hession : Thanks, Jen and thanks everyone for joining us. Before Gary reviewed our performance, I would like to point out a major change in the presentation of our results for our earnings released earlier today. Following the applicable guidance under generally accepted accounting principles Caesars Entertainment Corporation no longer consolidated Caesars Entertainment operating company after CEOC\u2019s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on January 15. However results for CEOC are included in our reported financial results for the first 15 days of the first quarter of 2015 and for the first full quarter of 2014. Following my brief remarks Gary will discuss company results as presented in the continuing CEOC column in the summary financial data of our earnings release. We believe discussing the continuing CEOC column of our financial data is more relevant to investors since it is a better measure of comparable year-over-year performance. As mentioned in the earnings release the continuing CEC call represents CERP, CGP Casinos, CIE and associated parent company and elimination adjustments and reflect the CEC structure as of March 31, 2015 and on a go forward basis with only 15 days of CEOC included in the 2015 reported CEC results and a full quarter in the 2014 results the reported CEC results do not provide a clear indicator of the core business conditions. As a reminder CERP is comprised of six properties and the LINQ promenade. CGP Casinos is comprised of six properties largely based in destination market and CIE is comprised of our social games business in our four money online gaming business. Additionally, we will provide supplemental information on today\u2019s call for CEC as if we had continued to consolidate CEOC throughout the first quarter of 2015. We have also posted these supplemental materials on our Investor Relations website. These materials include both standalone CEOC financials and key metrics for the first quarter of 2015 and certain financial information for CEOC as if CEOC remained a consolidated entity during the first quarter. We believe this information is useful to investors who are trying to understand year-over-year business results for the subsidiary. Recall that CEOC and a [ph] number of our regional properties as well as Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and London Clubs International. With that, let me turn it over to Gary. Gary William Loveman : Good afternoon, thank you all for joining today\u2019s call and for bearing with us to Eric\u2019s explanation of the complexity use of the earnings release. We reported today the company\u2019s best quarterly performance since 2008. The company\u2019s first quarter net revenue increased 21% year-on-year to $1.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA rose 37% to $301 million. Our results for the period were reflective of actions we\u2019ve taken to improve performance and position the company for profitable growth. These actions include the further alignment of our cost structure to the current operating environment, investments in new and exciting hospitality amenities and ongoing investments in Caesars Interactive Entertainment. The combination of our efforts to increase revenue and further reduce spending led to significant margin expansion in the first quarter and fuels by optimism for the long term potential to return and sustain pre-crisis margin levels. First quarter revenue also benefited from another terrific quarter at CIE, the additions of Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell as well as the advantage of favorable year-over-year hold. Market expansions in the quarter was driven predominantly by a combination of cost savings initiatives, lower corporate and overhead expenses and enhanced margins in food and beverage outlets. You\u2019ll recall that corporate and overhead expenses as well as startup cost related to new restaurant offering wane on profitability in recent quarters. We are pleased that those negative impacts have abated and turned into positive drivers of performance here at the first quarter. Our cost reduction efforts have been focused on marketing efficiencies and labor savings and these are yielding great results. We met our expectations on efficiencies in the first quarter and consequently the business has produced much better flow through from top line revenue performance. Adjusted EBITDA margins have improved from the fourth quarter and year-over-year significantly. As discussed previously we continue to expect our recent efforts to deliver an incremental $250 million to $300 million of EBITDA across the company from cost savings and EBITDA enhancing initiatives such as pricing actions. This projection includes impact within CEOC. Investment in our hospitality offerings for our customers remains a priority particularly in Las Vegas where guests are demanding more innovative amenities. In recent years, we made a consorted effort to expand and enhance our portfolio of hospitality assets especially at Caesars Palace to broaden customer segments that visit our properties and offer guests the best in hospitality, dining and entertainment. I believe we have been quite successful in this regard. Along these lines in March both the Omnia Nightclub and the Seersucker Restaurant opened at Caesars Palace, Omnia which replaces Pure has quickly become one of the hottest clubs on the strip. Situated right outside the club\u2019s main issues there is a new restaurant called Seersucker, the latest restaurant and lounge and celebrity chef Brian Malarkey franchisee. Separately we\u2019re pleased to announce that Mr. Chow will open his seventh restaurant in Caesar\u2019s Palace in the space previously occupied by Empress Court. Construction on this restaurant has begun and we anticipate an opening date later this year or early next. Also at Caesar\u2019s Palace, we\u2019ve added several new headliners at The Colosseum including Mariah Carey who begins her residency this evening and Reba McEntire and Brooks & Dunn whose show opens on June 17. Both shows have seen strong advance ticket sales and we eagerly anticipate the openings. Additionally, we are thrilled to say that Celine Dion will return The Colosseum stage in late August. Now let me provide you with some performance details for CERP, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and CGP. Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties delivered a particularly strong first quarter with revenue up 8% to $529 million. The majority of CERP\u2019s business consists of six casino resort properties largely located in Vegas as well as The LINQ promenade. Top line growth was primarily driven by a 6% year-over-year increase in gaming revenue due to favorable hold at Palace and improved volumes at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. The addition of new food and beverage outlets in The LINQ promenade and High Roller also contributed revenue increases in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA grew 43% over the year period to $162 million and EBITDA margins expanded 10 percentage points quarter-over-quarter and 8 percentage points year-on-year. CERP\u2019s flow through improved substantially as the pressure we had experienced from food and beverage margins in prior quarters have now subsided, now that the recently opened outlets comes fully ramped. Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas in particular experienced significant EBITDA growth driven by S&P revenues coupled with improved margins due to operating and marketing expense additions. The LINQ promenade and High Roller also contributed to CERP\u2019s results generating $7 million in Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. While this project has taken longer to ramp than originally anticipated, we continue to feel strongly about its long-term potential and are refining our strategy and marketing efforts to drive greater growth including further optimization of the tenant mix at The LINQ promenade. We look forward to announcing new concepts at the promenade in coming quarters. Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City also performed very well with volume improvements benefiting top line growth and effective cost control measures including marketing efficiencies driving enhanced property margins. That said, we believe there is still further room for improvement in Atlantic City and we are working to achieve it. We\u2019re nearing completion of construction at the water front conference center adjacent to Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. We are optimistic the facility will be a successful addition to the marketplace. We expect to host our first guest in late August. Advance bookings have nicely exceeded our expectations with possibly 60 groups booked many of which represent new business to the region. More than 100,000 room nights have been booked with 60,000 of those occurring in the first 12 months following opening. This compared to roughly 23,000 groups nights at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City in 2015 prior to the building of this facility. Groups hosting meetings at the conference center have already signed contracts for events far off as 2019. In a market that has been predominantly comp driven, we\u2019re encouraged by this level of activity in a heavily cash focused meetings and to merchant [ph] business. One of the primary objectives in building this facility was to stimulate new segment of visitation particularly mid-week and with cash paying customers and our progress is quite encouraging. Among the scheduled events is the World Education Congress in 2016, a global industry conference held by GE professional international that brings together several thousand buyers and leading professionals. We are looking forward to hosting this event as it showcases our waterfront facility and its capability, but more importantly will legitimize Atlantic City as the destination for business meetings generally. Caesars Growth Partners which consist of our interactive business in six destination market properties reported another impressive quarters. Revenues for the first three months of 2015 rose 36% compared to the prior year achieving $567 million with a 45% in adjusted EBITDA to $148 million. Performance was driven by exceptional growth in Caesar\u2019s Interactive Entertainment primarily to attributable to social and mobile game business as well as the addition of the Cromwell and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. CIE generated record results in the quarter of $177 million in net revenue up 42% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and $63 million in adjusted EBITDA a 101% increase from the first quarter of last year primarily due to exceptionally strong organic growth in its social and mobile games business as a result of the teams focus on monetization and the release of new game content. Year-over-year monthly paying users increased from 511,000 to 762,000 and average revenue per user per day rose from $0.24 to $0.31. This spectacular performance in CIEs social and mobile games business continues to be driven by our strategy of growing the paying user base of our key five franchises across all major social and mobile platforms in creating engaging and compelling games that appeal to the interest of a wide array of people. Increasingly these offerings are connected by our total rewards, social royalty program. With respect to real money online gaming we continued to look for way to attract new customers and grow this business. We\u2019re pleased to see growth in New Jersey and we continue to work on further enhancing our products and promotions for our four sites across two states. We were encouraged by momentum in Pennsylvania, California, and New York three important states for further legalization of online poker and online casino games. CGP\u2019s remaining operations which include CGP\u2019s six brick and mortar properties delivered 390 million of net revenue in the quarter, a 34% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $85 million in the first quarter. This performance was driven primarily by the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore, and the Cromwell which are showing promising results though ramping a bit slower than initial expectations. Additionally, lower gaming volumes at Planet Hollywood and Harrah\u2019s New Orleans were offset by increased efficiencies in marketing spend and other cost savings. The LINQ Hotel and Casino, the second phase of room renovation has concluded there and approximately 2200 rooms were back online shortly after the beginning of this month. With this latest development the entire property has been completely transformed earlier than scheduled and we anticipate coming in slightly under budget. Today, the hotel features newly upgraded rooms and suites with a fresh contemporary feel and floor to ceiling windows with views of the strip with a high roller [ph] . If you have a chance to see this property, you can hardly imagine what it was before. Additionally, all of the properties public spaces have been upgraded including the addition of a new pool, cabanas, a salon and spa and a signature lobby bar. These upgrades are already resulting in $45 increase in cash ADR and greater gaming and F&B revenue. Looking-forward we expect the activity at the Cromwell to pick up now that the property is entering its peak season with rates day club open to the summer. We also anticipate downward pressure on revenues in Harrah\u2019s New Orleans following the smoking ban that recently went into effect on April 27. In other jurisdictions where bans have been implemented revenues have declined by as much as 20%. Additionally, we are expecting a revenue impacted Horseshoe Baltimore in the second quarter due to the recent mandatory six day curfew imposed at the end of April during the period of civil unrest in Baltimore. Now that in mind, let me turn it over to Eric to review CEC\u2019s results as well as CEOC\u2019s financial results performance in greater detail. Mr. Hession. Eric Hession : Thanks, Gary. I\u2019ll start with a review of the company\u2019s year-over-year results as reported in our earnings release. As a reminder these results refer to the continuing CEC column of the release and include CERP, CGP Casinos, CIE, an associated parent company and elimination adjustments. I will then discuss CEOC standalone results for the quarter. These can be found in our Investor Relations website. Finally I\u2019ll discuss certain first quarter 2015 results for CEC as if we continue to consolidate CEOC throughout the first quarter of 2015. This information is also included as a supplement on our Investor Relation\u2019s website. As Gary stated, first quarter net revenues increased 21% from the prior year to $1.1 billion with a corresponding 37% increase and adjusted EBITDA to $301 million. Broadly speaking revenue growth was driven primarily by new outlets and the interactive business. Performance also benefited from favorable hold and lower expenses. Hold for our properties in the first quarter was quite strong and contributed $15 million in incremental EBITDA with favorable hold at our domestic properties more than offsetting some unfavorable hold at our international properties. As you aware, we have had volatility in the past with respect to hold particularly in the third and fourth quarters of last year. Additionally we achieved strong flow through by active cost control. Combined this lead to strong bottom line EBITDA results in the quarter. While we are pleased with these results, we recognize the need for same-store top line growth to return to the business. Our management team is focused on identifying opportunities to drive the same-store revenues through numerous channels including marketing and by efficiently deploying our capital. Throughout the first quarter of the year and into the second, we have yet to realize this across the majority of our portfolio. Concurrently we will remain disciplined with respect to our expense structure and will vigilant in offsetting inflationary expenses such as labor and taxes that pressure our business. Casino revenue rose 22% to $549 million and casino operating income rose 29% to $265 million mainly due to the addition of the Cromwell and Horseshoe Baltimore. Excluding the new properties gaming revenue grew approximately 3%. Room revenue increased 4% to $204 million due to the higher cash ADR of approximately $13 led by increases of Bally\u2019s Las Vegas and the Cromwell and by resort fees throughout our portfolios of properties. Overall RevPAR increased 8% year-over-year bringing lodging operating income improvement of approximately 7% to $153 million. Based on these results we believe that we have additional high return opportunities to invest in room product particularly in the Las Vegas market over the next few years. Food and beverage for the first quarter increased 8% to $200 million compared to the prior year period due to the opening of new outlets in Las Vegas including Giada at The Cromwell, guide theory [ph] outside of The LINQ Hotel & Casino and the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore. Profitability increased 8% year-over-year to $108 million. Other revenue rose 51% over the prior year to $274 million as a result of strong organic growth in CIE social and mobile games business and a full quarter of the Pacific Interactive acquisition from 2014 and by third party rent and entertainment revenue from the LINQ Promenade and Planet Hollywood. Operating expenses decreased significantly in the quarter due to cost savings initiatives, the impact of which can be seen in areas such as Casino expense, PG&A, and corporate expense. This led to an EBITDA margin improvement from 24% in Q1 of 2014 to 27% in Q1 of 2015. CEOC performance was also strong in the first quarter aided by favorable hold and solid cost control. CEOC generated $270 million in Adjusted EBITDA a 33% increase year-over-year despite generating a 2% year-over-year decline in net revenue to $1.2 billion. A decrease in revenue was driven by lower gaming volumes at Caesars Palace and poor hold at our London Clubs properties. The growth in EBITDA was attributable to favorable hold overall and our overall cost savings and EBITDA enhancing initiatives. Overall, we estimate the EBITDA impact from positive hold during the quarter for CEOC properties to be approximately $14 million. Caesars Palace performed well in the quarter as the previously referenced favorable year-over-year hold was able to partially offset a declining in gaming revenues and increased marketing and operational efficiencies can be credited for the strong flow through. In the regional markets, we\u2019ve seen an improvement in margins but continue to experience relatively flat top line revenue growth. Visitation from VIP guests in our regional properties remains relatively flat while we continue to see declines in visitation from non-VIP guest. We\u2019re encouraged that our business in Atlantic City is continuing to experience improvement and profitability. That said, the market is still broadly weak. Concerns remain with the tax and cost structure inherent in the market and we\u2019re supportive of the state\u2019s efforts to implement a long-term consistent structure. Although we\u2019re optimistic about the opening of our new Waterfront Conference Center within CERP, our concerns with the long-term prospects of the market remained. Management is focused on execution and remains on track to reach the CEOC EBITDA plan of $1.024 billion in 2015. Now combining CEC with CEOC results for the full quarter net revenues increased 9% from the prior year to $2.2 billion with a corresponding 35% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $572 million partially driven by favorable year-over-year hold which had a combined impact of $29 million positively. On a same store basis which excludes the impact of The LINQ promenade, Cromwell and Baltimore openings net revenue increased 3% from the prior year to $2.1 billion with the corresponding 31% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $553 million. This information as well as CEOC standalone results can be found in a supplemental information package on our investor relations website. Now moving on to liquidity, at quarter end CERP had $337 million in total liquidity comprised of $212 million in cash and cash equivalents and $125 million capacity remaining of the CERP revolver. CGP liquidity at quarter end was $1.0 billion of which $845 million was in cash and cash equivalents with the remaining $150 million attributable to the CGPH revolver and $10 million relating to the Baltimore credit facility revolver which is consolidated into CGP. CES had $90 million in cash and cash equivalents. With that, let me turn it back over to Gary. Gary William Loveman : Thank you, Eric, I hope you all have referred all the information you need to consider the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter is available to you though you may have to do a little bit more work independently that has been true in other cases. Before I make some concluding remarks, I would like to introduce Mark Frissora, who joins us today in our Board room and he will take over as CEO beginning the 1st of July. Since joining Mark and I have been working together to ensure a seamless transition and I am happy now to hand it over to Mark to say a few words. Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Gary, obviously Caesars is a leader in gaming, entertainment and hospital and Gary has driven significant growth during his tenure. I\u2019m very honored and excited to assume leadership of such a substantial enterprise at this most important point in its history. Since moving to Las Vegas I have spent much of my time over the three months getting to know the business. I have met with the senior leadership and many employee within the organization as well as visited the majority of the domestic properties across the network. I have also started the licensing and regulatory process and received all the necessary approvals to begin operating to my current role. I appreciate the hospitality that Gary, Eric, and the rest of the senior leadership team have extended to me since my arrival. I am surely grateful for the pros of wisdom imparted to me as I get up to speed on the company and the industry. As a result of what I have seen and heard in these meetings I\u2019m excited about the future of Caesars Entertainment. Despite the fact that Caesars has faced a tough operating environment I have been encouraged by the high engagement level of our employees and their strong focus on serving our customers. This focus has kept customer satisfaction levels high across the organization and provides a good foundation to grow and improve our business. I look forward to joining you on our second quarter earnings call this summer. Gary William Loveman : Thank you, Mark and welcome aboard. Since the financial crisis all of us have taken numerous steps to position Caesars Entertainment for growth while managing through what has certainly been a particularly challenging set of circumstances. During this period we have expanded into and build the best social games business in the world, added new properties in Maryland and Ohio and invested substantially in a number of innovative hospitality amenities particularly here in Las Vegas. Each of these is now contributing to top line and bottom line performance. We have also created a more efficient enterprise with minimal impact on customer service levels and the satisfaction and loyalty of our guest. Our first quarter performance where we achieved significant EBITDA margin improvement, is evident that these are of course yielding the results we had intended. On a personal note after 12.5 half years as the CEO of Caesars Entertainment this will be my last quarterly earnings call. I am delighted to conclude what needs to be more than 50 such calls with all of you on such a promising note. I look forward to continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board of this company. I am confident that Mark and the management team here will effectively execute on the initiatives underway to position Caesars for its nest phase of growth and development. These are really terrific times ahead for all of them. Before we begin to Q&A session, let me remind you as I have now for some quarters that we will not be answering any questions regarding the status of the CEOC chapter 11 process, or we say the various discussions with our creditors. With operator we will entertain questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Farber from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. David Farber : Hi, guys good afternoon, how are you? Gary William Loveman : Good David. David Farber : Hi, Mark congrats on the new role, Gary will on this, you are waiting inside. I have a couple of questions first probably for Gary or maybe even Eric. It looks to us like OpEx was down some 90 million or so in the CEOC type of the house. So I was just wondering maybe you could walk us through were you finding these cost saving opportunities as you touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks but maybe some additional color if you would. And then just remind us where you guys stand on the full cost saving story that 3 to 350, what\u2019s been realized, what\u2019s left have been realized and sort to how you see that mix spread out between CEOC, CERP and growth and then a couple of follow-ups? Thanks. Gary William Loveman : Yeah, David this is Gary. Let me try to describe broadly what has been undertaken here and then I will let Eric or Jackie describe the omnibus effort that you heard about. First, my remarks focus on CEC, we will not be giving replies on CEOC as you heard in Eric\u2019s proceed we are giving specific results on CEOC, but as I have indicated before for many years the business was run under the presumption that there was a lot of elasticity in the behavior of customer such that if you gave them a further induce to come and see us, you could be rewarded with a profitable additional visit over a lot of experimental work and a lot of effort to see whether that elasticity remained, we modified our marketing programs rather significantly to be prudent with the use of additional marketing expense to drive incremental visits particularly among customers whose average daily worth is relatively low. I think the work led by Tariq Shaukat our CMO in this regard and all of his analytics team has been very highly informed and careful and a lot of the expense reduction you see is with respect to much more sophisticated marketing. The other major portion of it comes from labor efficiency, some of which are associated with these marketing modifications and some come from more sophisticated scheduling and awful lot of attention to operating as efficiently as we can in each of our markets. Eric, you want to comment on the Omnia business savings target and your thoughts on its future. Eric Hession : Yeah, absolutely, Gary. David as you know late last year we entered into a program to save between $250 million to $300 million across a variety of avenues and channels. We are well underway into that. I think you can see the results in all three credits and on a consolidated basis, in terms of the margin improvement. As we\u2019ve enacted these efforts, we are continuing to evaluate the impact that they have both on the customer\u2019s response to our marketing as well as the customer\u2019s service that they receive in the outlets and we will be sure to moderate that as we move forward. At this point, we are still on target to achieve the full $250 million to $300 million for the full year and as Gary mentioned we\u2019re not breaking that out into specific impacts by credit. David Farber : Could you talk through what you think you achieved in the first quarter? Eric Hession : We\u2019re also not specifying that David and in part the challenges as you know we have the three different credits. We have filings that are put out monthly by CEOC for the group that\u2019s within the bankruptcy proceeding and then so we\u2019re only provided a consolidated target at this point. David Farber : Okay I\u2019ll move over to CERP then. The flow through is, even the whole impact as better than we expected. I would be curious if you think with some of the food and beverage cost behind you guys if you think you\u2019ll sort of see this margin improvement going forward and maybe where you guys think these properties can settle in now that you\u2019ve been running that for the next year or so would be helpful. And then I\u2019ll move away from CEOC? Thanks. Gary William Loveman : Yeah David this is Gary. I\u2019ll make a comment about margins. We experienced some of the best margins at the aggregated level that we\u2019ve had since 2008 and that\u2019s the result of the things you\u2019ve heard me and Eric and as Mark described in our comments, better marketing efficiencies, better operational cost containment, improved cash ADR, and I do think these things are likely to continue particularly in markets where we have better forward looking indicators like Las Vegas. So I think if you consider CERP as an example we can see the kind of margin sustaining that we\u2019ve experienced here in the first quarter. David Farber : Okay and then just last from me. I would just be curious to hear just Gary your thoughts of where the business is today meaning, anything you see in April there\u2019s been some operators who have been more optimistic than others. Just curiously here sort of where you stand on the regional markets of Las Vegas in particular and then that\u2019s it from me? Thanks. Gary William Loveman : Yeah, I, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about where the business looks in the second quarter and thereafter, David. Our business is I think looks very good for the reminder of the 2015 in Las Vegas due to the structural improvements at the maiden Atlantic City, you\u2019ve seen the results there, you are and your compare quite favorably in all the credit. And I think you\u2019ll continue to see that particularly with the benefit of the convention center opening in August, September of this year. In the regional markets as Eric indicated, it\u2019s [indiscernible] not great, not bad, the margin improvement has been our friend in these instances you know most every case. And then the one where of course we\u2019ve had concerns in New Orleans where we rather suddenly had a smoking ban placed in the latter part of last month and that\u2019s not going to be an easy thing for the business to address given that smoking remains legal in all the surrounding parishes and in coastal Mississippi as well. So I think with the expectation of New Orleans, the rest of the businesses in the portfolio have a very encouraging outlook for the reminder of the year. I do not share Mr. Vinc [ph] pessimism in that regard. David Farber : Okay, thank you. Gary William Loveman : The other thing I would add to that David is that when you look at the Las Vegas market, we with the expectation of The LINQ Hotel, we have had a period where we\u2019ve had general and modest construction disruption particularly in the CERP credit as we renovate the rooms that I alluded to in terms of where we see good return from the deployment of capital, we would expect some of the that coming through. Also in Las Vegas as we\u2019ve mentioned the visitation and the hotel revenues have a real tailwind at this point. We\u2019re seeing real pressure from a room rate standpoint, but then the gaming side again particularly the quinine as you see from the gaming reports has been relatively modest. And so for the rest of the year we do anticipate the strength on the room side. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hi, thanks, congratulations Gary and welcome Mark. Thank you. Thank you. Susan Berliner : So, I want to start if I could with CapEx, I was wondering if you could give any updated thoughts, I guess this is for you Eric with regards to both maintenance and then if you can just tell us where we are with regards to the convention center at CERP, how much is remaining to be spent? Eric Hession : Yeah, absolutely CERP, so we are still within the range that we had originally provided on an aggregated level. The $570 million to $750 million total full year CapEx, certain credits are ahead of pace but due to construction projects that are underway at the beginning of the year and others are behind and we will accelerate as for example rooms are taken offline and heavy capital is spend. In response to your particular question about CERP, as you know the convention center is well underway, it opens later this year. We have approximately $40 million remaining to be spent and we still anticipate hitting that $130 million to $200 million range of total capital for the year. Susan Berliner : Okay, great. And then I was wondering if you could talk about I noticed at CGP the cash amount was down by $100 million was there something purchase there for CIE or if you could talk about that? Eric Hession : Yeah, absolutely, that was the earn-out for the acquisitions that they had completed last year which was due and then fully anticipated as well as some share repurchases as part of the employee stock program and some other small items. Susan Berliner : Great, and then I guess just, and I think Gary, you had mentioned about your concern for AC on your outlook and I was just curious why that was? Gary William Loveman : No, I am actually a little bit more buoyant about AC, what I said was that we have more opportunity ahead of us. The city and the state government are in the midst of a very important negotiations for the future of Atlantic City to try on the one hand to reduce what is an excessive level of spend in the municipality to something that would be more reasonable for a city of that size. And then second the object of that negotiation has on the property tax burdens of the remaining casinos there. And if that is done in any kind of rational fashion such that for example the property taxes would be commensurate with what we experience in other jurisdictions on either a revenue or particularly an EBITDA basis then the profitability of all the remaining participants in that market could be enhanced very substantially. You undoubtedly read that there seems to be agreement among the parties as to the introduction of a payment in lieu of tax provision called the pilot in New Jersey, which just haven\u2019t happened yet. So, we like how the summer looks there through our properties given all the things we have done to make it more profitable particularly at t Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City and now we wait for some favorable political news out of the New Jersey which could really help, so I know it sounds almost heretical to talk about something optimistic in Atlantic City after all these years but I am cautious and optimistic. Susan Berliner : Great, and then I guess with regards to CERP with the free cash flow there, should we just assume that you will continue to focus on reducing the revolver there? Gary William Loveman : Yes, so with respect to the CERP credit, as you know the revolver was drawn to help fund the CapEx that we\u2019re deploying at the various projects including the convention center. As I mentioned we do anticipate doing some room renovation where we think there are great returns in the relatively near term. So, we do focus on balancing the investment in the facility versus maintaining the profile to pay down the revolver. But reset assured we\u2019re actively managing it and recognize that, that pay down over the long-term is where we want to go. Susan Berliner : Great and just one last question from me with regards to New Orleans, can you give us any color if what has been the impact thus far. I know it was relatively recent and also if there is anything you\u2019re trying to do to get any rebate or reduction in taxes in from that property? Gary William Loveman : Yes, I don\u2019t want to comment on what the results have been in the few days since the end of April it\u2019s been affected by the number of things like Jazz Fest and other events taking place in city. I would encourage you to look at the monthly results that are issued by the state of Louisiana where you get a lot of specificity about our property there, you can be sure that our colleagues, our political affairs team has been working in Baton Rouge to try to find some remedies along with the city to see if there is something as we can do to try to address what will undoubtedly be a painful issue there. We have had some experience with smoking bans that are brought on rather suddenly in other jurisdictions you have as well and I think you can guess what the impact on that is. Largely they don\u2019t effect visitation much but they affect length of stay quite a bit. We\u2019ll do things operationally to try to abate that but it will certainly be a bit of hit. Susan Berliner : Right thanks you very much, good luck Gary. Gary William Loveman : Thank you. Operator : Next call comes from the line of Kevin Coyne from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kevin Coyne : Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions and hello to Mark and good luck to Gary. Just there has been a lot of attention on Macau and as it relates to let\u2019s say Asian gaming play from Asian nationals over in Las Vegas and I know one of your competitors said that\u2019s its relatively small and are only 5% of their gaming revenue. I was wondering if you would care to couch the exposure or mix of revenue you get from visitation from Asia? Gary William Loveman : While we get visitation from Asia really at two properties at Caesars Palace and at Harrah\u2019s, usually at Lake Tahoe and that visitation is quite volatile month-to-month depending on largely on events, holidays and other invited events and we continue to think that this is going to be an important part of the offerings we have especially here at Caesars Palace. We have seen that in some of the results we have reported here in the first quarter and anticipate that being the case henceforth. I should add that Chinese visitors come from places other than Mainland China so many of our customers come from Malaysia, from Indonesia, from Taiwan, from a number of other places and our marketing teams are careful to continue to talk to customers in a variety of geographies. Kevin Coyne : Okay, thank you. Just switching to Baltimore for a second for Eric. I think this is best for you. In the Baltimore credit facility I think last I recall there was a financial covenant that kicked in a couple of quarters after opening. Is there any concerned about that covenant and if there is any pressure on the business? Gary William Loveman : No there is no concern at this point. Kevin you\u2019re right it kicks in a few quarters after the official opening date as defined in the credit agreements and that is being worked on currently with the bank\u2019s servicer and we have some final construction items that need to be completed by the contractor, so that date actually has not started, so we anticipate that the first covenant test will likely be in the first quarter of next year. Kevin Coyne : All right okay. Gary William Loveman : Even there we don\u2019t anticipate any issues. Kevin Coyne : Great, thank you. Just a quick question on Atlantic City, obviously the numbers have been good, and it seems like others are perhaps getting some of the benefit from some of the property closures last summer, but I was just curious related to your rated play within the city, people who let\u2019s say were historically Showboat customers, how sticky they have been coming to your properties, like you can even be able to retain most of that play, or is it just been perhaps you are benefiting from just other properties closing equally? Gary William Loveman : Kevin its good question. We have followed the activities of the Showboat customers carefully you might imagine and we have been quite successful with retaining than the other three properties. That was a result of some I think very effective marketing that we use with these guests in the periods the preceded the closure of the Showboat and continuing thereafter. We have not been as successful with moving customers from other entities that close Trump Plaza being an example or the Atlantic Club over that period as we have our own for reasons you can imagine, these were total award loyalist who were willing to change venue with us once Showboat was closed. Kevin Coyne : Great, and certainly great performance or great luck in the table hold side this quarter and of late, I was just curious either this quarter or last quarter have you had any changes to your casino credit policies which are perhaps helping give you a slight positive impact to the hold? Gary William Loveman : No. I mean this is just the large numbers doing expense. Some quarters it gives and some quarters it takes away. But there haven\u2019t been any systemic modifications Kevin in the way the business is executed or way the credit is considered, it had had any bearing on there. Kevin Coyne : Okay, Gary, great thank you. Gary William Loveman : Thanks Kevin. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Dennis Farrell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gary William Loveman : Dennis, we will have questions, the pressure is on now. Dennis Farrell : All right. Well I want to just talk about margins especially at CERP so you\u2019ve got a good comparable there. I mean the margins there, are kind of trending on 28% to 29% which is I mean dramatically higher than what you have historically put up at that entity. And I am just wondering, how sustainable those are going forward? And I was just, want to get an idea, I mean on the table hold adjusted basis it seems to be around 28% which is I mean, I think higher than the original 24% or 25% expectations, so I wanted to get thoughts what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable it is? Gary William Loveman : Yeah I\u2019ll take a shot at this, I feel pretty strongly about and then I will let Eric and Jackie as they want to revise these. I think these margins are generally sustainable. Obviously you factored out hold which I appreciate you\u2019re doing. But if you look at the hold adjusted or theoretical margins instead, I think we are in a point now where we can expect to see that continue. As I indicated this has been a function of both the improvement in the efficiency of our marketing and a variety of modifications in staffing. We\u2019ve seen a significant reduction in the number of people working in some of these properties, I don\u2019t expect that to be reversed. So I think as a result of substantially lower daily average operating cost in many of these businesses as well as more efficient marketing, we\u2019re going to see this continue also when you have the kind of ADR and RevPAR improvement that we reported this quarter the margin benefit of that kid of flow through is very, very good, so we really had all cylinders striking with respect to margin expansion in these cases. Jackie Marmo : Kevin, this is Jackie. I agree with you. Dennis Farrell : This is Dennis. Jackie Marmo : Sorry Dennis. Dennis Farrell : All right. Jackie Marmo : I would agree with Gary. I think one thing to note is a lot of the increased flow through on this hotel side of the business like Eric alluded to on a go-forward basis, we might see a little disruption in that as we start to renovate additional rooms, so when you\u2019re looking forward on your models there might be some blips due to that, but overall in the core business, we expect that to be sustainable. Dennis Farrell : What was the swing in Atlantic City last year versus this year? Was it a $10 million swing, or was it a $20 million swing. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea - EBITDA swing? Eric Hession : You\u2019re talking about three properties? Dennis Farrell : No I\u2019m talking about the CERP, the CERP property? Jackie Marmo : Oh Eric likes it. Gary William Loveman : We don\u2019t break it out Dennis. Dennis Farrell : Okay so, and then my last question of all I think which is important and you touched upon this a little bit is that Steve came out and commented about the summer kind of being uncertain and I know visibility for that time of the year is challenging in Las Vegas. I wanted to get your thoughts on why he is so cautious and why you\u2019re more constructive? Gary William Loveman : My lawyers have often cautioned me not to speculate on the intentions of people other than myself so I\u2019m not really not sure why drives Steve to say that. I will suggest that Steve\u2019s market, he has essentially one big very luxurious property in Las Vegas with a very different constituency than we have across all properties in Las Vegas, so all I can suggest to you is that based on what see in the forward booking profile for our guest both on traveling independently and also as parts of groups and the events that we encourage our casino customers to attend, we are much more encouraged by what we see and perhaps Steve has been in his case and as far as the macro economics are concerned, I don\u2019t see anything in the macroeconomic environment that I find discouraging with respect to conditions in Vegas being good for the remainder of certainly of the summer and throughout the remainder of 2015. So, I am not sure exactly what was provoking Steve beyond that but we feel very enthusiastic about what we see here for the remainder of the year. Dennis Farrell : Would you suggest... Gary William Loveman : I think no new supply additions coming to town over this period. We had a stable supply environment for some period of time. We reported including fundamentals in the hotels, got performance in our restaurants, new line, we have a number of new entities that are attractive to customers to come to our neighborhoods, so we like what we have available. Dennis Farrell : Is it fair to say that you are more domestically focused than some of the large operators that have more international play, I mean, I wondering if the strong dollars having an impact on their business more than yours? Gary William Loveman : Well, we\u2019re certainly more domestically focused in Caesars. I think in MGM case it may, we may be much more similar, Sheldon\u2019s is a bit of a mix, it could be even a strong dollar is a little bit more discouraging for inbound internationals in these case that could well be. Dennis Farrell : Okay great, enjoy your time. Thank you. Gary William Loveman : Are we considering anything about retirement? All right, operator I think that is the end of our call. Thank you to you and to everybody who joined us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Anita [ph] and I will be your facilitator today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. We will be taking questions via the phone line and instructions on how to do so will be given at the appropriate time. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Jacqueline Beato, Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer for Caesars Entertainment. Jacqueline, the floor is yours. Jacqueline Beato : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Second Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, the earnings presentation slide and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section on our website at caesars.com. The slides are available for download on the Events and Presentation section and will accompany Mark and Eric's prepared remarks for those of you on the phone they would like to follow along. Also, please note that, prior to this call, we furnished on Form 8-K a copy of this afternoon\u2019s press release to the SEC. Before we get on our way, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the following information on Slide 1 through 4. The Safe Harbor disclaimer in our public documents covers this call and the simultaneous webcast at caesars.com. The forward-looking statements made during this conference call reflect the opinion of management as of the date of this call. There are risks and uncertainties with these statements, which are detailed in our filings with the SEC. Please be advised that developments subsequent to this call are likely to cause these statements to become outdated with the passage of time, but we do not intend to update the information provided today prior to our next quarterly conference call. Today, we are reporting second quarter 2015 results. These results are not necessarily indicative of results in future periods. In addition, today's call will include non-GAAP financial measures, including property EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and certain supplemental financial information. Reconciliations of net income and loss to property EBITDA and net income and loss to adjusted EBITDA can be found in the tables of our press release. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners which includes two reporting segments, CGP Casinos and CIE. CEC also owns 89% of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company. However, CEOC\u2019s financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15th and our result in loss of control over material decision given the approvals required by the Bankruptcy Court and Independent Committee. Also due to the bankruptcy and result in loss of material decisions, CEC generates no economic benefits from CEOC\u2019s results. On this call, we\u2019ll discuss certain supplemental financial information including CEOC consistent with the 2014 Caesars reporting. As such the supplemental financial information is non-GAAP and is presented of the benefit for user to understand year-over-year in a comparable fashion. This information is not comparable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in our presentation. Additionally, the results are not indicative of future performance or the results that would reported should the Restructuring Support Agreement be successfully completed. On today\u2019s call, we will review both CEC\u2019s reported financial information as well as the supplemental financial information for CEOC. Detail on the owned and managed properties in these entities is highlighted on Slide 4. This call, the webcast and its replay are the property of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It\u2019s not to rebroadcast or use by any other party without the prior written consent of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect now. By remaining on the line, you agree to be bound by these terms. As we move forward with this call the words company, Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our and us refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities, unless otherwise stated or context requires otherwise. As seen on Slide 5, we\u2019ll begin the call today with some high level remarks by Mark followed by review of our financial results by Eric before Mark wraps up with some concluding comments. We will then open up the call for your questions. Let me now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Jackie. I am pleased to join today\u2019s call as President and CEO of Caesars Entertainment. Before I turn it over to Eric to review the details of our quarterly results, I would like to share my early impressions of the company and the opportunities that I believe lie ahead. Unless indicated otherwise, my comments relate to Caesars system-wide including our deconsolidated subsidiaries CR. Starting on Slide 6, as I briefly mentioned on our last call since joining Caesars in February, I spent much of my time learning about the business, meeting with the leadership team and visiting properties across the network. I am encouraged by what I have found thus far and we believe we have a solid foundation which to grow and to further transform Caesars in to the world\u2019s promenade entertainment company. Over the coming months, the senior leadership team and I will continue our strategic review of the business and together develop a strategy to drive growth and enhance performance for the near and longer term. While we have not yet completed this process, I can assure you my focus will on identifying opportunities to enhance growth, EBITDA margins and cash flow all the while keeping employee and customer satisfaction high. Taking together, our focus on these priorities will play critical role on improving all stakeholder returns. Our opportunities to strengthen performance range from initiatives that require minimum capital investment such as improving supply chain management or growing the number of active total rewords members to more intensive projects which could include investments in backend infrastructure and technology to yield greater efficiencies or expanding hospitality segments in destination markets. I would expect investments in Las Vegas room product which will drive cash ADR growth to be among the fist and highest priorities. I have no doubt that further investments in hospitality will be a major component of our strategic plan. I\u2019ll communicate more details of our strategy procedures later this year. Continuing CEC reported a strong, very strong second quarter, which you can see on Slide 7. Net revenues for continuing CEC which as a reminder exclude CEOC increased 17% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew 56% to $347 million. Adding CEOC to CEC on a supplemental basis, net revenues increased 8% year-on-year to $2.3 billion with a corresponding 42% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $647 million. Increased revenues were attributable to the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell, the renovation of The LINQ Hotel, exceptional growth in the interactive entertainment business and strong hospitality performance. Marketing and operational efficiencies, favorable year-over-year hold as well as higher cash mix in hotel and food and beverage outlets were also contributors to results in the second quarter. As a result of all of these factors, the business delivered the highest quarterly EBITDA margin since 2007. Company\u2019s system-wide performance is a testament to the contributions and commitment of our team across the company ranging from operators to the game developers and CIE and on to the marketing and analytics team in our corporate office. The significant improvement in EBITDA in the first half of the year were margins grew 591 basis points year-on-year was generated to the performance of new investments and disciplined expense management. Further, our continued improvements are still challenged by the fact that core gaming growth in the regions has not recovered to the extent seen in Las Vegas. As I mentioned earlier, hospitality\u2019s substantial growth opportunity procedures and is an areas in which we have found and focused our efforts over the last several years as shown on Slide 8. While the majority of our hospitality investments have been concentrated in Las Vegas offerings have also been expanded in the regional markets. On the next several Slides, you can get a sense of projects across the Caesars system they are currently underway where have been recently completed. Moving to Slide 9, we have invested in development of the Waterfront Conference Center adjacent to Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. We\u2019re very excited to open this facility in the coming weeks. Group room nights at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City for the first 12 months are more than triple the room nights realized in 2014 and double our underwriting case. Eric will provide additional details in his remarks. Turning to Slide 10, the renovation of The LINQ Hotel and Casino was completed in July completing transforming the property. Since the room renovation was completed in May, cash ADRs have increased 45% year-on-year. We anticipate this growth will stabilize later this year as the first renovated rooms came online last October. Harrah's New Orleans also finished an upgrade of half of its guest rooms in the second and third quarters of last year and we are developing plans to renovate the remaining rooms. On Slide 11, you can see some of the projects at CEOC. Many of the hospitality projects that we have discussed with you in recent years have been focused on Caesars Palace including a state-of-the-art conference center, the Garden of the Gods Pool Complex, the world\u2019s first and only noble hotel and the Octavius Tower & Villas. A reminder that Octavius Tower & Villas room by served, we have also substantially upgraded our restaurant offerings at Caesars Palace including noble restaurant, Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill and the Bacchanal Buffet. We also spoke last quarter about the opening of Omnia and Seersucker, new headliners of The Colosseum and the planned replacement of Empress Court with Mr. Chow. In May, VISTA Lounge open, which replaced Shadow Bar and is generating nearly triple the revenue of its predecessor. In addition to these investments in Las Vegas, other hospitality assets have also been enhanced across the CEOC regions including the renovation of Jack Binion's Steak House at Horseshoe Tunica and the remodel of Legends Restaurant to Smoke & Ray at Horseshoe Southern Indiana which is expected to be completed later this quarter.  Harrah\u2019s Lake Tahoe is also going to hotel and commencing space remodel with those new assets expected to come online in December this year. We\u2019ve recognized that continued investment in hospitality entities across our owned and managed portfolios necessary to maintain and grow the business. Considering the improvement and cash flow, I expect this type of investment would just generated high returns to get over the new few years. We will be prudent as we evaluate future investment opportunities to ensure capital allocated project to create significant value for our stakeholders. Give our lower capital expenditures on room project after the economic crisis. We believe this will be an area that should offer rich returns for several years. Let me now turn the call over Eric for more detailed review of this quarter\u2019s results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll first start with continuing CEC\u2019s consolidated results for the second quarter followed by a review of the company\u2019s reportable segments and then discuss the supplemental information we have provided on our website which included CEOC\u2019s second quarter performance as well as continuing CEC plus CEOC\u2019s results. Slide 13 summarizes continuing CEC\u2019s results which do not include our deconsolidated subsidiary CEOC. For the second quarter of 2015continuing CEC net revenues increased 17% to $1.1 billion with a 56% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $347 million. As previously discussed, top line improvements were attributable to the openings of Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel, organic growth in the interactive entertainment business and strong hospitality performance. Review improvement marketing and operational efficiencies, favorable year-over-year hold as well as strong hotel and F&B margins led to the year-on-year improvement in EBITDA with margins expanding 747 basis points. Excluding Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell, same store net revenues increased 9% and adjusted EBITDA increase 51%. Moving to Slide 14 and Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties which is comprised of six casino resort properties largely located in Las Vegas as well as The LINQ promenade. Serve delivered revenue in the second quarter of $566 million an increase of 5% year-on-year. Performance was largely driven by higher gaming revenue and hotel revenues. The growth in gaming revenues was due to increases in slot revenue and favorable year-over-year table hold largely at Paris. Hotel revenue increases were attributable to 10.5% increase in cash ADR mainly from resort fees. Adjusted EBITDA increased 42% year-on-year to $182 million and margins expanded by 836 basis points due to a higher cash mix in hotel and F&B outlets, efficiencies in marketing and labor and favorable hold. Favorable hold at serve contributed approximately $8 million in EBITDA for the quarter. The Waterfront Conference Center adjacent to Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City is nearly complete with the grand opening just around the corner. At the end of the quarter, capital expenditures at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City for the Conference Center were $112 million with a total $125 million budgeted for the project. The facility will began hosting guest at the end of August with a first large group in early September. Our nationwide sales forces focused on further building a pipeline of meetings and convention business to stimulate mid-week visitations from these cash paying customers. We are very pleased with the pace of preopening bookings and have a 150,000 room nights already scheduled at the facility, 90,000 of which are scheduled in the first 12 months opening. This compares to 23,000 group room nights realized in Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City in 2014. Turning to Slide 15, Caesars growth partners which include the interactive entertainment business and fixed destination market properties posted a strong quarter. For the business as a whole, second quarter net revenues increased 31% to $576 million with a 52% increase in adjusted EBITDA to a $161 million. EBITDA margins expanded 381 basis points. Performance was driven by the social and mobile games business at CIE and the competed renovations at The LINQ Hotel as well as the additions of Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell excluding the tow new openings, same store net revenues for CGP were up 12% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up $42 million or 41% year-on-year. During the quarter, CGP faced a number of non-industry related challenges included the smoking ban was introduced in New Orleans and the civil unrest in Baltimore. Breaking apart the CGP results, we will first look at the CGP casino\u2019s segment on Slide 16. Net revenue was $390 million in the second quarter, up 33% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $91 million and margins grew 259 basis points. Top line results were primarily attributable to the openings of the Horseshoe Baltimore and the Cromwell and the renovation of The LINQ Hotel and Casino which experienced a 45% lift in cash ADR year-over-year along with higher gaming and F&B revenues. This performance was partially offset by lower gaming volumes at Harrah\u2019s New Orleans due to the smoking ban that went into effect citywide on April 22nd. Horseshoe Baltimore\u2019s performance was also adversely affected by the civil on rest. Year-on-year EBITDA growth for the CGP Casino segment was driven by improvements in marketing and operational efficiencies that was partially offset by the management fee expenses incurred after the May 2014 property acquisitions. We estimate that smoking ban in New Orleans is negatively impacted net revenue by approximately 10% in the second quarter and expect this to remain a headwind for the foreseeable future. We are actively exploring ways to mitigate this impact overtime including on property cost efficiencies, marketing measures and the potential development of new manatees such as outdoor smoking patios. Moving to Slide 17, momentum in the interactive entertainment business remained strong with CIE delivering another excellent quarter. Net revenues increased 28% to a $186 million and adjusted EBITDA rose 56% to $70 million. EBITDA margins expanded 660 basis points. Performance was mainly due to strong organic growth in our market leading social and mobile games business as we continued to focus on monetization and the release of new gaming contact. Monthly unique paying users grew to 796,000 in the second quarter from 539,000 last year. And average revenue per user per day increased to $0.31 up from $0.26 over that same period. On the real money gaming front, deposits and revenues increased in Nevada since the World Series of Poker tournament began at the end of May. In New Jersey, we continue to focus on cross marketing and cross promotional initiatives with total award. Separately, the World Series of Poker tournament which started at the end of the May was the largest even with a record 103,512 entries. We also have the largest live Poker tournament ever of clauses which has 22,374 entries. Turning to Slide 18, which shows the supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s second quarter performance. Net revenue declined 2% year-on-year to $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 42% to $303 million. The revenue decrease was primarily attributable to lower year-on-year reimbursable expenses from our managed properties. Excluding these reimbursable expenses, revenue was up 1% driven primarily by improvements in hotel and entertainment revenues which will partially offset by declines in casino and F&B revenue segments. The decline in casino and F&B revenues were influenced by marketing program changes which enhance the profitability of those business verticals. Year-on-year, the increase in EBITDA was driven by marketing operational efficiencies, favorable year-over-year hold and a higher cash mix in hotel and F&B outlet leading to the margin expansion of 779 basis points year-on-year. The EBITDA contribution from favorable hold during the quarter was approximately $8 million. Hospitality initiatives continued to perform strongly at Caesars Palace but the performance of the property was impacted by a substantial drop in Baccarat volume consistent with the industry-wide slowdown by respective customers. We believe weaker Baccarat volumes will persist through the remainder of the year. In CEOC\u2019s region markets, net revenues declined modestly in the majority of the region. Visitation from VIP guests at the regional properties remains relatively flat while declines in visitation from retail guest have continued, partially as a result of the marketing program modifications. These challenges contributed to strong year-on-year EBITDA improvement. Now let\u2019s take a look at the additional supplemental information for the second quarter on Slide 19. As Mark mentioned earlier, Caesars system-wide net revenues rose 8% from the prior year period to $2.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 42% year-on-year to $647 million. During the quarter, positive hold contributed approximately $16 million in incremental EBITDA. Excluding the performance of the Cromwell and Baltimore opening, same store net revenues increased 4% year-on-year to $2.2 billion with a corresponding 40% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $630 million. Looking at revenue by category, casino revenue grew 6% aided by new developments and favorable year-over-year hold of across the Caesars live system. As I noted before, lower volumes in the high end international play have led to continued challenges across from baccarat. We do not anticipate these headwinds abating in the second half of the year. Excluding baccarat, table games and slot revenue both increased slightly in the quarter. F&B revenue increased 2% year-on-year benefitting from new developments. F&B profitability was up nicely due to improved margins and higher cash mix. Hotel revenue grew 12% year-on-year due to a 10.6% increase in cash ADR primarily as a result of resort fees. While hotel profitability increased due to a higher cash mix. Combined with strong organic pricing environment, this led to record levels of cash hotel revenues. For Las Vegas in particular, we experienced a very strong hotel environment during the second quarter with May being a record revenue month due to the May weather pack and a strong Memorial Day weekend. This performance coupled with ongoing expense reductions drove EBITDA margin expansion of 675 basis points. As part of the overall cost savings initiatives, marketing spend has been reduced considerably. This reduction impart is a result of work done to improve customer profitability and mix, while these adjustments have led to some declines on a gross volume basis, we believe that they have generated substantial improvements in casino profitability and EBITDA across the Caesars system. That said we are mindful that this is an area that needs to continuously monitor and adjusted to ensure we are driving benefits and improvements and profitability. Before I turn the call back over to Mark, let me briefly review liquidity on Slide 20. One item to note on our liquidity is that we did pay down $15 million of our outstanding CGPH revolver subsequent to the quarter. As our cash generation improves across CERP and CGPH will continue to focus on prioritizing investment in high return capital projects particularly in our hospitality offering. Now let me turn the call back over to Mark for some closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Eric and please turn to Slide 22. Overall the second quarter was a continuation of a positive first quarter results, while gaming volumes continue to be mixed across the system, much of this itself and dos as we take actions to drive profit improvement. In particular, reductions and free slot play incentives have lowered reported gaming volumes but enhanced overall profitability. On the CERP side, hospitality amenities continue to perform quite well. Coupled with cost saving initiatives, we delivered strong margin expansion especially at our Las Vegas properties. For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved the highest property EBITDA margins for owned and managed CERP properties combined. Management will continue to be focused on retaining our industry leading margin percentage. As you know we had delivered these results despite CEOC\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. The restructuring of CEOC remains a fluid process and we will continue to provide updates on developments as appropriate. I know that the restructuring process in the state of our discussions with various creditors the topic of interest on everyone\u2019s minds. However, given the ongoing negotiations proceedings, we will not be answering discussing questions of this nature during today\u2019s Q&A session. Slide 23 is our outlook page. As far as industry trends, though the industry is showing modest to low growth, which is better than what we\u2019ve seen over the last five years, we are far from peak levels. Hotel, food, beverage and entertainment revenues in Las Vegas continued to be a strong point with the hotel rate environment being a particularly bring spot. On the gaming front, slot gaming volumes in the regional markets are still not as strong as Las Vegas and we are exploring how to improve slot performance as we think about the development of our strategic plan. We will have more to report on this in the coming quarters. Regarding supply dynamics, most markets are stable to the proliferation of slot set bars in Illinois and the opening of a DC area casino post risk to our performance in those region. In Atlantic City, fundamentals for the properties we own and manage have been improving now that the market capacity has stabilized after server property closers. So far in the third quarter, we are off to an encouraging start, July gaming, food and beverage and hotel results have all been favorable, while still exhibiting the expected weakness discussed earlier in New Orleans and Caesars Palace volume. Early indications from our hotel bookings lead us to believe August will also have good demand in Las Vegas. Moving to Slide 24, is important to note for all of our stakeholders the following significant accomplishments procedures. This quarter, we delivered the highest margins in the Las Vegas Strip of any public casino company. Our nine Strip hotels grew faster than the industry. The Colosseum at Caesars Palace was named \u201cVenue of the Decade\u201d by Billboard Magazine. We are the number one global social mobile casino themed game provider. Caesars whole is a 100% gaming fair share premium across its domestic markets as measured by win per gaming unit. Our significant investments in hospitality assets over $1.3 billion during the last five years in Las Vegas alone are generating strong results and at 49 casinos worldwide, Caesars operates more casino locations than any other publically traded casino company. Moving to Slide 25, going forward, we are concentrated on the core business and identifying discreet actions we can take to grow the company. We will emphasis driving revenues and efficiencies, expanding margins and enhancing cash flow operations. Our strong performance in the second quarter demonstrates these attributes with EBITDA and EBITDA margins improving significantly year-over-year. On the expense side, we will remain focused on maximizing corporate and on property cost efficiencies while improving employee and customer satisfaction. We are making progress on our previously stated goal of generating the incremental 250 million to 300 million of EBITDA from cost savings and EBITDA enhancing initiatives including CEOC. Additionally CEOC is on track to meet or exceed its EBITDA at $1.024 billion in 2015. Together these efforts will tie into our strategic plan to drive strong future growth and profitability. With that we now open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hey, good afternoon. Mark Frissora : Hey, good afternoon. Susan Berliner : So I wanted to start with I guess your commentary Mark on July. I was wondering if you could talk about gaming and I guess on a - I guess apples-to-apples comparison because I know some of the comps which is the regional markets were easier, when you are talking about July, you are seeing any notable increases besides is your comps from last year? Mark Frissora : We saw sequentially from June to July and improvement in July in general and we saw an increase year-over-year in pretty much all markets. So is that answer your question? Susan Berliner : Sure. And then just with regards to the resort fees, I guess Eric, can you remind us when those were implemented last year? Eric Hession : So it\u2019s two drivers see that are causing the increase, one is that we\u2019ve expanded the number of our segments that book into the hotel that receive fee and then in addition we had increased our resort fees in January, so we had actually implemented them broadly prior to that. Susan Berliner : Okay, great. And then was there any change I guess companywide or any of the entities with regards to maintenance CapEx? Eric Hession : No. No change with respect to maintenance CapEx. Susan Berliner : Okay and I guess will just see that in the various SEC filings REIT entity? And that\u2019s you have - Eric Hession : Are you talking about total CapEx or the specially made? Jacqueline Beato : Yeah, specific to Q2 CapEx or you asking about the range of the expected CapEx? Susan Berliner : Both actually. Eric Hession : Yeah, so for - I can give you that, now for Q2 CEOC spend 37 million, this is total CapEx. CERP spent 50 million, CGP spent 70 million and CES spend 6 million. As I mentioned earlier, the full year estimates are unchanged and we continue to be pacing well to hit all those ranges we previously provided. Susan Berliner : Great and just a couple other follow-ups, I guess with regards to the AC convention center, I think you said you are 30 million less but I know if there is reimbursement coming from the state? Jacqueline Beato : Yeah, Susan, I think we talked about how it works for forbid a prorate reimbursement from a spent that we spent the CapEx first and so that process continues throughout the build. Susan Berliner : And Jackie, is there any amount that you expect to get back in 3Q or 4Q that you could provide to us? Jacqueline Beato : No, we don\u2019t have specific estimates on when we are going to get those. Susan Berliner : Okay and then just on the CGPH side, the project CapEx spent there for the LINQ and what\u2019s remaining there? Eric Hession : We - as you know the LINQ is open at this point, so we are basically paying invoices related to the project that have come in delayed behind when the assets put into service. We have approximately $25 million left that we anticipate coming in on that project. Susan Berliner : Great and if I could sneak one and you guys didn\u2019t talk about the performance of the LINQ and I was just wondering if you could talk about that at all? Mark Frissora : Yeah, so we\u2019re still very pleased with the response we are getting, the experience is great for the real the feedback we get from the customers is very positive. In prior periods we did breakout the actual EBITDA performance because it was new asset but now that we\u2019ve annualized it and it\u2019s been reflected in both periods. We haven\u2019t been breaking it out and we don\u2019t plan to going forward. Susan Berliner : Great, thank you very much. Mark Frissora : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Farber with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. David Farber : Hi guys, good afternoon. How are you? Mark Frissora : Hi David. David Farber : Hi Mark - for the conference calls, I had a couple of questions, first I wanted to just tackle CERP for a minute, the margin was again better than we had expected which is promising. I am just curious what is driving that, you know at two quarters now at the 30, so what\u2019s driving that and then what are your expectations for CERP margin into the back half? And then a couple of follow-ups, thanks. Mark Frissora : So in general, our margins are being driven by marketing efficiency, if you will we\u2019re getting much better at identifying customers that are profitable in those at we give things away that we probably shouldn\u2019t because it doesn\u2019t make sense, we are not driving incremental volume. So those efficiencies are helping out a lot. And then also our labor productivity in operations is a significant improvement year-over-year hence driving 10s of millions of dollars of improvement in the operating results. And then in terms of sustainability, we believe that all of this is sustainable, these margins are sustainable and that we\u2019ve got other incremental projects and today that will continue to drive this kind of productivity improvement as well as we think the marketing efficiencies will continue as well. David Farber : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just following through that, if in fact we are able to see sort of better margins into the back half, what would you intend to do with the incremental free cash flow, you sort talked about projects, I am curious specifically on LINQ or CERP in general, would you use the free cash flow for what projects and would pay down potentially if that something to be curious, or excuse me, interested doing on the CERP side? Eric Hession : David, I\u2019ll take the first half and then Mark can feel free to jump in on this if I miss anything. But - you\u2019re right at the entity we\u2019ll start to generate significant free cash flow as we continue to move forward. As we talked the assets in this portfolio consist of some rather large hotels. We mention that we think the returns from renovating those rooms are quite appealing right now, particularly in Las Vegas and also in Atlantic City with respect to the new convention center coming on. And so we are starting to evaluate which hotel tower to renovate and what sequence to maximize the returns. I think you\u2019ll see starting a renovation at a hotel tower Paris here in Las Vegas shortly. And then as we move into next year, we\u2019ll evaluate some other hotel towers as well. In combination with that we\u2019ll evaluate the potential to pay down the remaining balance on the revolver as well. So it\u2019s going to be a balancing effort based on the results and where we see the best opportunities. David Farber : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then CEOC side of the house, we\u2019re not six months into the year, just curious sitting here today with the outlook you talked about, how do you feel about the plan EBITDA you set up in the beginning of the year, is that attainable, is it reasonable or is it potentially too conservative, any thoughts around that and what you see for the balance of the year for CEOC? And then I have one other, thanks. Mark Frissora : I mean on our remarks, we pretty much said that we expect to meet or beat our expectations. In terms of any other color it\u2019s about the best I can do because out business has obviously some inherent volatility goes into the luck components the whole component and so we want to make sure we\u2019ve giving you numbers then expectation you count on. David Farber : Okay, understood. And then just sort of the as an operator all the three larger segments, I am just curious from the day-to-day and may this question is for Eric if he can help, what sort of reliance you might have on the parent company, any thoughts around there if you could help us and are there any issues legal issues that could impact surplus growth with respect to the parent or thoughts around that would be helpful? And that\u2019s it, thanks. Mark Frissora : So, David, I\u2019ll just remind you that the parent is essentially a holding company. It has the three end primary asset that it owns is a 100% of CERP, it consolidates CGP and then as 89% ownership in the COEC which is deconsolidate. So that\u2019s about all the we can say, there is no real assets, there is no properties, there is no suppliers. Yeah so the point is it\u2019s just a holding company. So it\u2019s - other than that there is nothing significant. David Farber : Okay, very good, thanks for the time. Mark Frissora : Thanks David. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kevin Coyne : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a follow-up just Sue\u2019s question, did you say July was better than June or did you say it was better than the second quarter trends? Mark Frissora : I think it\u2019s in general probably let\u2019s see I would June for sure and I wouldn\u2019t say broadly the second quarter because as you May was kind of blowout for everyone in the industry because of the fight that was here in Vegas. Kevin Coyne : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Just a quick question on baccarat play, would you say are people still coming to the market and just not spending at the level they did in the past or have people just completing start coming? And second part of that question is what indicators are you looking for over the medium to longer term as potential leading indicators to a return of that business or is some of that potentially permanently gone? Mark Frissora : Some extend year-over-year there is a tough comp, so we should understand that begin. But secondly I think you know we expect the business to begin to slowing come back to historic levels as the issues that surrounding what\u2019s going on in China the premier stands on gambling in general lighten up and we\u2019ve had a lot of as you know kind of different thing that have occurred within Vegas in terms of regulations and tighter environments here and I think that also make sometimes the larger gamblers in China a little to come. So there is a lot of different drivers. In general, the whole industry experiencing this so we are not unique to the industry how we feel that we are doing awful a lot to make sure we market ourselves as one of the top Asian play houses with Caesars and plan at Hollywood and Paris and a lot of the facilities that we have for the billers that we have within the strip itself. And we are also able to leverage our big network and New Orleans, Atlantic City were some of that play as well. Kevin Coyne : Great, maybe just a question on status of let\u2019s say room renovations in terms of how many room were offline this quarter versus the first quarter and versus a year ago, maybe Eric or Jackie can comment. And perhaps when you\u2019ll see those rooms go back to a normal cadence of being offline? Eric Hession : Yeah, so Kevin, as you know we had a major renovation going on as a link and room started to come back online in October of last year and they fully came back online early in the second quarter. And so you would have seen during both the fourth quarter and the first quarter some significant room outage particularly at that property. As we move forward, again you\u2019ll see some construction disruption from room renovation but we are planning to stagger the room renovations to ensure that we don\u2019t have a significant number of hotel rooms out at anyone times such that they would materially impact the operations. And as I mentioned when we do analysis in terms of the returns from these projects we take into account the potential disruption from having the rooms out and we still believe these are extremely higher term projects. Kevin Coyne : Great, just one final on the 250 to 300 million of projected cost savings, would - give an update in terms of how much progress you\u2019ve made on reaching that goal to date? Mark Frissora : I think we try to steer clear giving projections on it but we feel bullish about how well we\u2019ve done year-to-date and what we\u2019re likely to do by the end of the year. So the best I can tell you at this point. Kevin Coyne : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hi, I apologize, I just had a couple of follow-ups both actually on the CGPH side, I was wondering if you could reconcile the actual EBITDA for the restart to grow? Mark Frissora : Reconcile it to what. Susan Berliner : It just seems that the Caesars\u2019 press release had a number in the CAC press release has a number for casino properties and then you put in EBITDA for I guess Baltimore and Cromwell and it just seems that people are coming up a little bit variation, so I just was wondering if you could confirm is it like 82 million? Jacqueline Beato : So Sue I think it\u2019s a breakout of the segment is different between the two press release, so the CAC press release has in other segment. I think if you look the Caesars press release CGP is in two segments that\u2019s in CIE and then everything else. So if we take the other segment and the casino property segment from CAC press release they should match our press release. I don\u2019t know if that reconcile that difference for you. Susan Berliner : I think so, okay. And then just one quick follow-up on New Orleans, I know Eric you talked about contemplating doing something there and I guess I was wondering why way those just a function of drawing our plans to try to figure out exactly what you are going to do? Eric Hession : Yeah, we\u2019re not waiting obviously, we are doing everything we can to offset the impact of the decline in revenues and we are being as aggressive as we feel as prudent in terms of both from marketing changes as well as operational changes. But in terms of the construction related items, it\u2019s exactly as you noted we have to make sure that we think through what we want to do from a design perspective and then get the appropriate permits and construction process. Susan Berliner : Okay, great, thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to presenter. Jacqueline Beato : That\u2019s all at this point. Thank you so much for joining our call. Operator : Thanks again for joining us today. This concludes our webcast. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Mark Frissora : Thanks Jackie. The factors that drove the company's tremendous first-half performance persisted through the third quarter and I am pleased to report the Caesars delivered another strong quarter and three months ended September 30. Starting on Slide 6, net revenues for continuing CEC, which as reminder excludes CEOC, increased 12% to $1.1 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew 51% to $317 million. Adding CEOC to CEC on a supplement basis net revenues across the enterprise increased 5% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. The exceptional business performance is driven by higher gaming and hotel revenues, excellent labor and marketing productivity improvements as well as continued strong performance in Caesars Interactive Entertainment social and mobile games franchise. Gaming revenue increases were driven by a full quarter of Horseshoe Baltimore results compared with a partial quarter last year and a favorable year-over-year hold. The renovation of a LINQ Hotel and Casino, the expansion of resort fees across all properties and improved pricing power at our Las Vegas hotels to better yield management led to a strong growth in the hotel category. These revenue drivers coupled with ongoing marketing and operational efficiencies and improved customer mix in hotel outlets led to a 43% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA to $630 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins rose 710 basis points to 27% our highest quarterly EBITDA margin system wide since 2007. Through the first nine months of 2015 we have delivered on our stated objectives to produce strong EBITDA margins and our properties continue to produce the highest margins on the strip. We also increased our net revenue share on the strip. Outperforming our peers and outpacing market growth these results are a testament to our teams focus on an effective execution of our cost control efforts as well as the performance of our new assets. We plan to sustain these margins and continue to lead the Las Vegas Strip through a combination of top line growth initiatives and ongoing productivity efforts which should improve stakeholder of returns in the future. Moving on to Slide 7, as we have certainly shown over the past several quarters, we are intensely focused on ensuring at our expense bases appropriately sized for the enterprise. These efforts have allowed have allowed us to meaningfully enhance EBITDA margins over the course of this year, with the majority of the increase coming from significant improvements and marketing efficiency across the enterprise and have relentless approach to continuous improvement within our operations. The year-over-year savings and marketing spend are a result of several initiatives. First we have reduced spend relative to the elevated levels seen last year, as these expenditures were less affected than anticipated. Particularly our free slot play program. We\u2019ve also moved a large number of our marketing programs from direct mail to e-mail and digital channels, which is now, have been cost effective but allows us to be more agile and personalize. Additionally, we have implemented a more targeted approach on offers resulting in enhanced customer profitability. Lastly we have augmented our data analytics operations to serve a performance management function to more closely monitor and track marketing efficiencies as well as productivity improvements in operations. We believe that these changes to our marketing approach are the right most and will be sustainable over the long-term. Importantly we have been able to make these cuts and have maintained market share on a year-to-date basis while keeping customer and employee satisfaction high. From an operations perspective we have realized substantially efficiency gains over the last nine months and we continue to see additional opportunities. We\u2019re applying an improvement focused operating model to all areas in enterprise including revitalizing our lean efficiency program. The program is designed to create a sustainable platform and culture to continuously drive process improvement and efficiency gains as well as enhanced customer experience particularly at the property level. We have already identified some immediate areas of opportunities such as high transaction food and beverage outlets, laundry facilities and housekeeping. During the last few months, we have been able to lay the groundwork to get the program up and running, including creating cross-functional teams and establishing property site leader positions to manage the initiative. As part of this progress we are working with a vendor that will help provide oversight, and six Sigma Black belt training and certification to property site leaders. We'll begin rolling out the program formally at the end of this year and expect it to be fully implemented with site leaders at every one of our properties by the end of this first half of 2016. We expect this effort to yield meaningful efficiency gains over time. Turning to Slide 8, for our future success we reorganize the need to grow topline revenues across the system. As I stated on our prior call, hospitality will provide a significant source of upside for Caesars. Since the financial crisis, we have under invested in our room product relative to our competitors, so we believe upgrading our room product is a tremendous opportunity particularly in Las Vegas increased demand across the industry coupled with the hotel renovations we have completed over the last two years have given us greater pricing power in our hotel portfolio and we have seen in many years. Additionally, over this same period, we have made significant enhancement in our yield management platforms and capabilities. Yield management refers to our pricing, management and optimization of hotel inventory. These enhancements have driven material improvements in our customer evaluation, pricing, and inventory management. These factors have enabled us to drive substantial improvements in ADR and to outperform our competitors. In each of the last four quarters system wide cash ADRs increased double-digits year-over-year with strong growth in Las Vegas. With room upgrades delivering a high return on investing capital, we view these types of projects to be an attractive low risk user available cash and planned to make investment in our Las Vegas room product a top priority over the coming years. Turning to Slide 9, to that end we have recently removed from inventory the Roman Tower at Caesars Palace, and we've started extensive renovations. Given the investment at our flagship property over the last several years, we are very excited to bring the room product in that original tower in line with the rest of the building. The new rooms including high-end suites started growing on sale in late October with the first guest expected to stay in the new tower in January 2016. The tower will be rebranded as Julius Towers once it reopens next year. We believe the financial and application impact of this renovation will be substantial. In addition, we are renovating a significant percentage for suite product at Paris, to ensure that our high worth net gaining customers continue to receive a great room product experience. Starting in January, 148 rooms and suites will be upgraded. We expect this project to be completed in the second quarter of 2016. We are also making targeted investments at Planet Hollywood. Renovating 183 rooms including 15 suites in the fourth quarter of this year. We also plan to start a remodel at the Carnival Tower at Harrah's Las Vegas in December to modernize 672 rooms including 72 suites. Complementing our hotel investments as shown on Slide 10, we have made a priority over the years to offer our customers the best in entertainment and dining options at each of our properties. We recently announced a three-year extension of Britney Spears Piece of Me show at Planet Hollywood through December 2017. Since opening almost three years ago, the show has received rave reviews and is sold out on a regular basis. Britney\u2019s continued residence will be shared now with Jennifer Lopez, bringing her All I Have show to the stage in January 2016. Additionally, Reba and Brooks & Dunn have extended their popular residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace into 2016, as have Donny and Marie at the Flamingo. As seen on Slide 11, we are also enhancing our food and beverage outlets with the highly anticipated opening of Mr. Chow's restaurant at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas set for December 2015. We are also making numerous investments outside of Las Vegas including new restaurants such as Smoke & Rye at Horseshoe Southern Indiana, Guy Fieri\u2019s El Burro Borracho at Harrah\u2019s Laughlin and Noodle Bar at Harrah\u2019s North Kansas City to expand cuisine offerings. Moving to Slide 12, in September we celebrated the opening of the Waterfront Conference Center adjacent to Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City. Customer reception to the facility has been very positive and our nationwide sales force has made great traction in building the new business pipeline and putting Atlantic City on the map as a destination for corporate and association meetings. We now have 160 events booked in the new space, and over 150, 000 room nights. 61% of total bookings over 90,000 room nights are scheduled in the first 12 months of operations compared to approximately only 11,000 at the same time last year. On Slide 13, you will see that we have opened Harrah\u2019s Cherokee Valley River Casino & Hotel in North Carolina at the end of September with an overwhelming response from visitors to the property on opening day. This is the second property that Caesars manages for the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians. Adding to our solid stream of management fee income and reinforcing our strong relationship with the tribe. Turning to Slide 14, we are also focused on opportunities to accelerate revenue growth through the expansion of Millennial & Generation X Customer Base. These customers represent a very large and growing opportunity for the casino industry, both in Las Vegas and in regional markets. We believe that they are interested in gaming, but not in the same way as their parents or grandparents. They need new types of content more comfortable experiences and more social settings. We are actively testing a number of programs, products and experiences aimed at improving to our ability to attract, engage, and retain this important customer segment. Two examples of the new social environments we are creating for younger customers to enjoy and explore include O'Shea's at the LINQ, and our Tag lounges, which are large virtual gaming centers containing electronic tables that we have debuted and a number of our properties across the country. We are also making a consorted effort to expand and enhance our gaming product offerings as seen on Slide 15. Although we continue to believe that there is a general lack of innovation on the part of our primary slot providers, we were intrigued by some of the new products and are starting to see from a subset of these manufacturers including the early versions of skill-based games. We are eager to try these new gaming options to some of the millennial friendly environments we are developing and are already deploying a few things with skill-based components as part of our current offering. We believe that are stronger product offerings set in a strategically created modern and social environment will add excitement to Los Vegas and regional casinos. More to come but we believe this is will be a very core platform growth for us and the industry moving forward particularly in regional markets. Let me now turn the call over Eric for a more detailed review of this quarter\u2019s results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll first start with continuing CEC\u2019s consolidated results for the third quarter followed by a review of the company\u2019s reportable segments and then discuss the supplemental information we have provided on our website which included CEOC\u2019s third quarter performance as well as continuing CEC plus CEOC\u2019s results. Slide 17 summarizes continuing CEC\u2019s results which do not include our deconsolidated subsidiary CEOC. For the third quarter of 2015 continuing CEC net revenues increased 12% to $1.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA grew 51% to $317 million and margins improved 709 basis points. As Mark noted earlier revenue performance was driven by four quarter of Horseshoe Baltimore results, strength in hospitality offerings particularly in the hotel vertical. Mainly due to resort fees, driving higher cash ADR favorable year-over-year whole and continued organic growth in CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business. The year-over-year improvement in EBITDA was primarily attributable the revenue increases, marketing and operational efficiency and improved hotel customer mix. As we mentioned in our press release Caesars Entertainment accrued $966 million of commitments related to the first lean RSAs. As you may recall we announced a few months ago the CEOC have secured the support of its largest and most senior creditor consistencies, representing holders of more than 80% of CEOC\u2019s first lean bank debt and first lean notes. Slide 18, summaries the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resorts Properties. Third quarter net revenues grew 1% year-over-year to $542 million due to strong hotel performance driven by resort fees and improved hotel yielding, but was partially offset by a decline in entertainment revenues due to a lighter show calendar versus prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-on-year to $157 million, EBITDA margins expanded 602 basis points due to marketing and operational efficiencies improved hotel customer mix and favorable property taxes. There was minimal impact from hold in the quarter. Year-to-date the EBITDA impacts from favorable year-over-year hold is estimated to be between $17 million and $21 million. Moving on to Caesars Growth Partners on Slide 19. CGP experience another strong quarter with net revenues increasing 24% to $602 million an adjusted EBITDA growing 62% to $170 million. Margins expanded 663 basis points year-on-year. Revenue performance was driven by the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore strong growth in CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business and higher hotel revenue resulting from the expansion of resort fees and continued year-over-year ADR improvement at the linked hotel due to the renovations that were completed earlier this year. Within the CGP business our first review the CGP Casino segment on Slide 20. Net revenues were $407 million in the third quarter up 26% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 85% to $96 million and margins grew 754 basis points. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a full quarter of Horseshoe Baltimore results compared to one month last year. The completed renovations at The LINQ Hotel which experienced a 63% year-on-year increase in cash ADR during the quarter as well as higher food and beverage revenue. The expansion of resort fee and favorable year-over-year hold. Revenue growth along with marketing and operational efficiencies drove EBITDA performance in the quarter. The EBITDA contribution from favorable year-over-year hold in the quarter was approximately $9 million to $13 million and approximately $14 million to $18 year-to-date for the CGP Casino segment. Harrah\u2019s New Orleans was a contributor to revenue and EBITDA growth in the quarter due to very favorable year-over-year hold and table games. That said from a core business perspective volumes at the properties continue to impacted by the smoking ban and were down approximately 15% in the quarter. We expect Harrah\u2019s New Orleans to experience continued volatility month to month as it adjusts to the operational challenges from the smoking ban. We focused on mitigating the negative impact on our revenues by developing outdoor smoking courtyards that provide more convenient and safe alternatives for our smoking guests. We also plan to place limited slot machines in the courtyards pending approval. We hope that these actions along with other marketing efforts will help us offset the double-digit declines in gaming volumes since the smoking ban went into effect. Since we spoke last quarter trips and visitation to Horseshoe Baltimore are back to the levels seen before April's episode of civil unrest. The property has delivered improved performance on account of stronger gaming volumes as the market responds to its wide range of amenities and unique entertainment offerings. Baltimore delivered its best quarter since opening last August and has generated record revenues in EBITDA for the month of August. Topline growth however was impacted by unfavorable year-over-year hold in the month of September. Now let\u2019s look at the Interactive Entertainment business on Slide 21, which continues to deliver exceptional results. Third quarter net revenues increased 20% to a $195 million and adjusted EBITDA rose 40% to $74 million. EBITDA margins expanded 523 basis points year-on-year to 37.9%. Performance was mainly driven by strong results in social and mobiles due to continue to monetization of the user base. Monthly unique paying users grew to 860,000 in the third quarter up from 595,000 last year. And average revenue per user per day increased to $0.33 up from $0.29 over the same period prior year. Slide 22 provides a snapshot of liquidity at quarter-end for the CEC consolidated entities. Slide 23, shows the supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s third quarter performance. Net revenues declined 2% to $1.2 billion due to lower reimbursable expenses and lower gaming revenues. Excluding reimbursable expenses, revenue was relatively flat year-over-year driven by gaming revenues declined in CEOC\u2019s regions partially driven by marketing program changes as well as reduced baccarat volume at Caesars Palace, which were offset by favorable year-over-year hold at Caesars Palace and higher room revenue due to the expansion of resort fees an increasing cash ADR. Adjusted EBITDA increased 35% to $313 million leading to a 709 basis point increase in margins primarily due to marketing and operational efficiencies. The EBITDA contribution from the favorable year-over-year hold in the quarter was approximately $20 million to $25 million and approximately $37 million to $41 million year-to-date. In Las Vegas hospitality amenities continue to perform extremely well at Caesars Palace. As Mark mentioned in his remarks, we are currently renovating enrollment tower, which has taken approximately 600 rooms offline at Caesars Palace. The renamed Julius Towers is expected to welcome its first guests at the beginning of the New Year. Conversely on the gaming front, we continued to see a challenging VVIP environment with substantial declines in baccarat volume in the quarter, however that\u2019s consistent with the rest of the industry. We don\u2019t expect this to mitigate for the reminder of the year and currently anticipate further declines in this segment of our business throughout 2016. As I mentioned a moment ago, CEOC\u2019s regional markets experienced lower gaming revenue due to marketing program modifications that have been implemented over the last nine months, with retail guests visitation showing notable declines. While we have experienced slight declines in growth gaming revenues, market share year-over-year, Casino profitability and EBITDA have substantially improved and we believe that this is the right decision for our property. We continued to monitor the effect that marketing changes have on our performance and customer behavior to ensure that we are driving benefits and enhancing profitability. Beginning in mid-2016, certain of CEOC's subsidiaries will transition the management responsibility of Horseshoe Cleveland, Horseshoe Cincinnati and Thistledown in Racino over to Rock Gaming and its subsidiaries which currently owned three properties. We are working with Rock Gaming to ensure seamless transition and are taking appropriate steps to minimize any disruption to customers. Reward credits for total reward numbers will remain valid at all Caesars properties. Now, let\u2019s take a look at additional supplemental information for the third quarter on Slide 24, which includes our deconsolidated subsidiary CEOC. Caesars system-wide net revenues rose 5% from the prior year to $2.3 billion mainly due to full quarter of Horseshoe Baltimore results favorable year-on-year hold, strong hotel revenue growth from resort fees and pricing strength and continued strong performance in the social games business at CIE. As Mark noted earlier, we have expanded resort fees to all of our hotels system-wide which is a key driver of the 13% increase in cash ADR we experienced during the quarter. Revenue growth coupled with ongoing expense reductions particularly around both marketing and labor efficiencies resulting in adjusted EBITDA increasing 43% year-over-year to $630 million with the corresponding margin increase of 710 basis points. During the quarter positive year-over-year hold contributed approximately $30 million to $35 million in EBITDA and brings the year-to-date impact from positive hold to between $70 million and $75 million. While our property is benefited from favorable hold so far this year, we expect this to normalize over time. Looking ahead we expect to face headwinds related to inflationary cost pressures including salary and benefits and we will be focused on offsetting these increases through the productivity efforts. Additionally, as we annualize the programs related to our marketing and operational efficiency effort, year-over-year comparisons will become more difficult. Our capital expenditure expectations for the full year 2015 remain unchanged from our prior updates with continuing CEOC expected to end the year in the range of $365 million to $480 million. CapEx spending is ramping up on several projects such as the Roman Tower renovation at Caesars Palace. CEOC is expected to close out 2015 with CapEx spend in the range of $200 million to $270 million. We are currently in the planning process to determine CapEx for 2016 and expect to share that with you on our next earnings call. The business is generating more cash than we originally anticipated over the last nine months due to our outstanding financial performance, which will enable reinvestment in these businesses. We continue to take a thoughtful approach on how we deploy our capital ensuring it\u2019s invested in higher return projects. Let me turn it back over to Mark now for some closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Eric. If everyone can please turn to Slide 26, we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Though gaming volumes, particularly at regional properties have been under pressure as result of marketing program changes, these adjustments have driven improvements in gaming win and overall profitability. The investments we have made in enhancing our hospitality assets are clearly paying off. With improved pricing power of our hotels and better customer mix in hotel and food and beverage outlets. We also continue to realize benefits from our cost saving initiatives. Selectively this resulted in strong year-over-year EBITDA margin performance for the third consecutive quarter. As we closed out 2015 I believe we are well positioned to sustain this momentum. We are on track to achieve or exceed our previously stated goal of generating an incremental $250 million to $300 million of EBITDA from cost savings and EBITDA enhancing initiatives inclusive of CEOC. Further, CEOC is on page to meet or exceed its published EBITDA target of $1.024 billion this year. As far October, results demonstrated another strong months of performance driven by hospitality revenues with Las Vegas hotel revenues up double-digits. Turning now to Slide 27, as we move forward we are focused on enhancing revenue and driving productivity gains to further improve margins and cash flow while maintaining high levels in employees and customer satisfaction. In the most recent quarter, we have seen an improvement in customer satisfaction a very important measurement for us. This is in part due to our incentive platform that ties employee compensation to the overall customer experience. While the senior management team and I are in process of finalizing with the development of our strategic architecture for the business. We have identified a few cornerstone initiatives that will play pivotal role in achieving these objectives some of which by touched on in my opening remarks. These include one reinvesting and high return projects such as room renovations, two developing innovative entertainment environments to attract and retain younger customers, three expanding the total rewards database particularly active members, four inspiring a sales culture at every level within the company and finally focusing on are continuous improvement culture. As I discussed last quarter, these initiatives range from those require and minimal capital investment to more intensive projects and we will only allocate capital projects and activities we believe will create significant value for our stakeholders. I look forward to outlining our growth strategy for the company on future calls. In summary, we are very focused on a balanced agenda of growth and efficiency initiatives, amid the background of CEOC\u2019s restructuring process and look forward to completing our process is quickly as possible. We believe our marketing and productivity improvements are sustainable as evidence by our market share performance. Additionally, as we gain further tractions in our productivity initiatives we will concurrently invest to improve our Las Vegas hotel product to drive year-over-year games in ADR. With that, we will be happy to take your questions. At this time, we ask to keep your question focused on the performance of the business itself. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Farber. Your line is open. David Farber : Hi, guys how are you. Mark Frissora : Good. David Farber : Very good, I have three questions. First on CERP, I just wanted to talk again about the margins they were up I don\u2019t know some four or five season of basis points since 2013, 2014 obviously. Just curious what do you think the biggest contributors are to the margin improvement on the OpEx line? How do you see that going forward and then I had a couple of follow-ups? Thanks. Mark Frissora : Again, we look at the combination of factors, but is kind of equally balance between the marketing spending efficiency that were getting coupled with the labor productivity at the property levels. So those two things kind of property represent 80% of that we also that some year-over-year improvements in margin due to some of the properties in CERP performing better because it had time to perform if you will. So that\u2019s been an additional point. Eric anything to add to that. Eric Hession : The only thing I\u2019d add Mark is that David as you know those CERP properties are very large properties with substantial hotels generally speaking and benefited from the increase in ADR and the associated flow through. As you know with the demand particularly coming into Las Vegas for the FIT and Group segment that\u2019s enabled properties of large hotels to be able to increase their ADRs and that\u2019s have great flow through. And then to respond your second comment we absolutely believe these margins are sustainable going forward and we will be driving to grow that through the initiatives that Mark mentioned focusing on the continual improvement environment. David Farber : Very good. You touched upon some of the targeted room product investments in Las Vegas and maybe just tacking on to what you just mentioned Eric, given some of your reason project that have been finished. Can you may be just walk us through how you are thinking about maybe return on investment or any expectations you have or just color around how some of the returns have been met with respect to link or any other properties you\u2019ve done in the hotel side of Las Vegas and then I had just two more? Thanks. Eric Hession : Sure, David. So we as you know during the recession we had pull back on our room renovation projects and then recently ramp those up in 2013 and into 2014, completing a few hotel towers particularly the valley south tower and most notably the link and its entirety and what we\u2019re realizing is that the customers that are coming to Las Vegas are absolutely willing to spend additional dollars per hotel night just stay in a renovated room and they will pay an incremental amount that provides a very solid return to us. So without getting into return specific numbers you can understand from our perspective that incremental ADR per room night over a period of time since we sold the room nights running in the mid-90s of occupancy generate substantial return. And from a risk perspective renovating a hotel room given that we do them continuously as relatively low. Mark Frissora : In fact, if I can just add that when we look at the last years of capital projects and to a detailed review which ones have had the highest returns for us and represent the low risk it is a renovation of our hotel room and Vegas its applicably high payout and we get ROI eyes of 35%, 40% on average which are very high returns as you might imagine and it\u2019s because that in Vegas you can hold would say higher price typically and we can under index versus our competition for the last four, five years and we are still under index. If we look at our product you compare to theirs, our pricing isn\u2019t where it needs to be, given that we actually have comparable facilities but the room products not quite up to snuff. So we think that\u2019s big upside forces we move forward. David Farber : That\u2019s helpful. Just CEOC for a moment you briefly touched up you are phase or potentially exceeding what was budgeted I guess couple of quarters ago at this point. What\u2019s driving our performance there is at the top line is at the cost side and then may be just very broadly talk about your expectations for those regional businesses in 2016. I know you don\u2019t give guidance but just broad expectations and then I just had one big picture questions and that\u2019s it. Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yes, broadly speaking David I would say that it has been more focused on the cost side both balance between our marketing initiatives and our operational initiative. There have been upsides on the CEOC side in terms of the hotel performance in number of markets. But CEOC is also through its ownership of Caesars Palace have been impacted by the decline in the VVIP business. Going forward, we don\u2019t provide guidance but as we are working our way through the planning process for next year. We are assuming relatively modest revenue growth and we are continuing to focus on the cost side to ensure that we are able to achieve our plans, if we are fortunate enough to have the economy in such a state that there is tailwind in excess of what we are planning for, then we will be able to really see exceptionally strong flow through because we will make sure that our cost structure, which is entirely controllable is very tight. David Farber : Very good. Just real quick I mean since we spoke last obviously a competitor has announced a REIT and we have maybe another one with GLPI. I guess I am just curious big picture any thoughts around does the value creation change as there\u2019s more REIT\u2019s in the gaming land space at all any thoughts there? And then that\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yes, unfortunately David, we are not in a position to comment on that due to the restructuring at this time? David Farber : Okay, thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Good afternoon. Mark Frissora : Hi, Susan. Susan Berliner : I guess I wanted to start, I know you guys talked a lot about room renovations and I was trying to, I know you haven\u2019t announced anything for next year. But I was trying to get an idea of what kind of renovations you are talking about, are you talking about just kind of soft cause and any sort of magnitude and I guess secondly, Eric I was wondering if you could go through the CapEx spend because even though CERP came in higher than we expected. I am looking for some cash flow, I was kind of wondering if CapEx that was higher than we had modeled? Mark Frissora : We kind of announced if you look at some of those slides, what projects we be doing next year, specifically in Vegas, so there are quite a few projects, we mentioned that why should in the progress flow for next year. And I don\u2019t know if Eric, if you want to mention any another but goes for kind of the bigger ones, bigger - any big increase at all in capital spending. There is no plan at all to change if you will the way we spend capital; we are focused on spending at the narratives that we think have the highest returns. Eric. Eric Hession : Yes, I just say we have a couple of large projects rolling off. As you are aware the Atlantic City convention center and then the linked projects had considerable CapEx spend this year. As Mark mentioned, reallocating a fair portion of that to room rent innovation projects we believe is the next step forward. We mentioned some plans to renovate substantial room at Paris and Hollywood, the Harrah's Hotel Tower that will be starting later this year, but rolling into next year and then the Roman Tower here at Caesars will come fully online next year. From a CapEx standpoint for CERP we continue to project in that $130 million to $200 million range and that should be consistent with the prior guidance that we have provided. Susan Berliner : Will be CapEx spend be in guess in the Qs after the quarter? Eric Hession : Sorry I didn\u2019t get. Can you repeat your question? Susan Berliner : Sure, I guess I was just wondering if the CapEx spend per I guess entity will be in their respective Qs? Eric Hession : Yes, it will be there. Susan Berliner : Okay. And then just turning to I guess CES I know you guys had set it up last year around this time and I know there have been talk about you potentially looking to I didn\u2019t know if it was kind of reset annually, if you can give us any update on how that\u2019s going or fits in place already? Eric Hession : Yes, for those not as familiar I think you are talking about the reset of the allocation percentages, is that correct. Susan Berliner : Yes. Eric Hession : Yes, we had discussions and we did reset the percentages earlier this year between the three subsidiaries. Susan Berliner : And how would we know how they reset, is that going to be in the respective Qs? Eric Hession : The CGP Q will have the CGPH percentage and then - so it will be there. Susan Berliner : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Frissora : Sure. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue at this time. Jacqueline Beato : Great. Listen, thank you operator and thanks everyone for listening in on call. We look forward to updating you on our future plans and initiatives to deliver stakeholder value. Thanks again. Operator : Thanks again for joining. This concludes our webcast and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Jen, and I'll be your web event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. Brian Blackman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Brian, the floor is yours. Brian Blackman : Thank you, and good afternoon, and welcome to Caesars Entertainment fourth quarter and full year 2015 results conference call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, certain earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at caesars.com. The slides are available for download and will accompany Mark and Eric's prepared remarks for those of you on the phone that would like to follow along. Also, please note that prior to this call we furnished a copy of this afternoon's press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and will shortly file our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before we get underway, I'd like to call your attention to certain statements and information on Slides 1 through 4, which we incorporate by this reference. The forward-looking statements Safe Harbor disclaimer in our public documents covers this call and the simultaneous webcast at caesars.com. This call, the webcast and its replay are the property of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It's not for rebroadcast or used by any other party without the prior written consistent of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect now. By remaining on the line, you agree to be bound by these terms. Today's call will include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, property EBITDA and certain supplemental financial information. Reconciliations of net income and loss of property EBITDA and net income and loss to adjusted EBITDA can be found in the tables of our press release. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners, which includes the two reportable segments, CGP Casinos and CIE. CEC also has a majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, but CEC's financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15 of 2015. However, in addition to a review of CEC's reported financial information on this call, we will also discuss certain supplemental financial information regarding CEOC, including certain remarks that combine CEOC's results with those of CEC. This supplemental financial information is non-GAAP and is presented as a benefit for users to understand year-over-year results in a comparable fashion. This information is not preferable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in our presentation. Additionally, the results are not indicative of future performance or the results that would be reported such the Restructuring Support Agreement to be successfully completed. As used during this call, the words company Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our and us refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. As seen in today's agenda on Slide 5, we'll begin the call today with some high-level remarks by Mark, whose comments will generally relate to the entire Caesars system, including our deconsolidated subsidiary CEOC. Eric will then review our financial results, before Mark wraps up with some concluding comments. We will then open up the call for your questions. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Brian. I am pleased to report that the company's excellent performance in the first three quarters of 2015 continued into the fourth quarter, culminating in the best full year performance for Caesars Enterprise since 2007. As Eric will discuss later in further detail, at continuing CEC, which excludes CEOC, full year net revenues increased 15% to $4.5 billion and full year adjusted EBITDA increased 46% to $1.3 billion. I will now speak more broadly to enterprise-wide performance, which adds CEOC to CEC. Beginning on Slide 6, you will see that we delivered solid annual improvement year-over-year across three critical measures, financial performance, customer satisfaction and employee engagement. Notably, our enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA margins rose 662 basis points year-over-year to 26.5%, the highest annual EBITDA margin since 2007 pre-recession and expanded by more than 500 basis points year-over-year in each quarter of 2015. On a continuing CEC basis, adjusted EBITDA margins rose 608 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, we increased our customer satisfaction scores by 300 basis points across the enterprise as well as improved our overall score in our annual Employee Opinion Survey for the 10th consecutive year. These results were delivered amid the backdrop of considerable distractions, including the restructuring of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company and a challenging operating environment, particularly in the regional markets. They highlight the success for our improved operating model and our strategic investments in the business, which position the enterprise for enhanced financial performance going forward. Moving to Slide 7, enterprise-wide net revenues rose 6% year-over-year to $9.1 billion for the full year. On a continuing CEC basis, net revenues rose 15% year-over-year to $4.5 billion for the full year. Revenue growth was driven by higher hotel revenues with cash ADR up double-digits, aided by the expansion of resort fees across all properties and improved pricing in Las Vegas, as well as the full year contribution from Horseshoe Baltimore and The Cromwell and the renovation of the LINQ Hotel and Casino. We also benefit from continued solid organic growth in Caesars Interactive Entertainment and slightly higher gaming revenues, due to favorable year-over-year hold. As I mentioned earlier, the enterprise experienced notable margin expansion across each of four quarters in 2015, which is detailed on Slide 8. Our ability to drive cost savings initiatives through marketing and operational efficiencies help deliver an incremental $350 million of EBITDA in the full year, bringing our adjusted EBITDA to $2.4 billion, up $706 million or up 42% versus prior year. On a continuing CEC basis, adjusted EBITDA growth was a 46% increase versus prior year. A key contributor has been the reduction of enterprise-wide marketing spend relative to elevated spend in prior years. This has resulted in both reduced free slot play offers and a 4% reduction in casino direct expenses, as we implemented a more targeted approach on complimentary awards to enhance overall customer profitability. As we touched upon last quarter, we are also applying a low-cost high-quality operating model across all of our businesses by implementing Lean Sigma principles, a highly effective efficiency program. We formally rolled out the program at the beginning of the year and are gradually enacting it across the enterprise. Our efforts are focused on identifying process efficiencies, improving the customer service experience and increasing employee engagement. We have already recognized some immediate areas of opportunity, including front desk operations, high transaction food and beverage outlets, laundry facilities and housekeeping. We expect these efforts will steadily ramp up during 2016. The recapitalization of our hotel room product in Las Vegas to market levels over the last two years has been a meaningful driver of topline growth, due to our higher cash ADR. As you see on Slide 9, it has helped us deliver market leading EBITDA margins on the strip for the full year. We have demonstrated that room upgrades are an attractive low-risk opportunity to deploy cash and we will continue to pursue this opportunity. In 2016 we expect to complete renovations for more than 4,800 hotel rooms in Las Vegas and more than 5,700 owned or managed rooms across the enterprise, representing approximately 20% and 15% of total rooms across Las Vegas and enterprise-wide, respectively. We have several targeted investments, both in Las Vegas and our regional properties on the horizon. On Slide 10 and 11, you can see several of our ongoing capital projects, as we execute against this priority. These property upgrades include the transformation of the original tower at Caesars Place to create the Julius Tower as well as the renovation of the Augustus Tower at Caesars. Additionally, we will complete room upgrades at Paris, Planet Hollywood and Harrah's in Las Vegas. In our regional markets, we will renovate Harrah's Gulf Coast, Caesars Atlantic City and Horseshoe Tunica. These investments in our infrastructure across the enterprise will enhance our long-term performance and hospitality. Moving to Slide 12, Caesars offers a wide range of leading entertainment shows in the strip. We maintain the highest quality of performance at the Colosseum, including Celine Dion, who played for sold-out crowds during the fourth quarter as well as The AXIS Theater and the recent opening of Jennifer Lopez's spectacular show in January, which received rave reviews from critics and played to sold-out crowds. On top of these acts are a pool of celebrity talent at our Las Vegas venues continues to appeal to our guest at all age groups and interest. This includes Mariah Carey, and Reba McEntire and Brooks & Dunn at the Colosseum; Britney Spears at Planet Hollywood; Mat Franco's magic show at the newly renovated LINQ Hotel; and the new Rock of Ages show at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino. As a result of our ongoing efforts to be at the forefront of the entertainment space, in 2015 Caesars Entertainment was named one of the three largest live entertainment promoters in North America, based on box office revenue; and the Colosseum was named the top venue in theatres of its size for the 11th time by Billboard Magazine. We remain focused on actively investing in our hospitality business to capture the growth and consumer spending towards these types of activities and ensure that our entertainment offerings are the best on the strip. On Slide 13, along with the expansion of our entertainment offerings, we are also investing in our food and beverage operations, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately priced restaurants and buffets. MR CHOW made its strip debut at Caesars Place, opening in stores in December. In 2016 The LINQ Promenade will add three new exciting tenants, Virgil's Real Barbecue, Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips and Amorino Gelato, while looking for a new anchor tenant in what was previously the Kitson location. Additionally, the Beer Park by Budweiser, located in Paris, Las Vegas, opened at the end of January as the strips first rooftop bar and grill. In Atlantic City, we have remodeled Bally's Wild Wild West Casino, opening it up to the Boardwalk and spanning available indoor and outdoor space, while refreshing our gaming products to create more of an entertainment space to target millennials. This renovation also includes three new food and beverage outlets in 2016, a new bar space with a stage called the Boardwalk Saloon, a counter serving Guy Fieri's award winning barbecue and the Atlantic City Snack Shack with a variety of options near the 24/7 happy hour Mountain Bar featuring a mechanical bull and beer pong tables. Another critical investment area for us has been the service technology, as seen on Slide 14. Across guest arrival, hotel, dining and gaming, we are modernizing the customer experience, while lowering cost. During the 2015 renovation of The LINQ Hotel, we centered the guest arrival experience and the technology and convenience, and were first to market in Las Vegas with the deployment of a fully integrated self-service check-in program that incorporates email, text, web, mobile app and kiosk. This is another way we are differentiating our hotel offering on the strip. For the first time, customers at The LINQ Hotel, Flamingo and Caesars Palace had a choice to interact with live front desk team member or visit a kiosk to check-in and receive their keys. On average, using the kiosk versus waiting in line for the front desk, reduces check-in time by 40%. Reception from the customers to date have been very encouraging and we are expanding the Las Vegas rollout to five more properties in 2016. Looking at Slide 15, we continue to focus on game innovation efforts and our strategy is twofold, reenergizing the core slot player and engaging the millennial and Generation X customer base. There are several underlying initiatives in motion to deliver on this strategy. First, we are launching new table game products, including our own proprietary side bets. Second, we are investing in the on-property experience. Third, we are introducing skill-based games. And fourth, we continue to challenge slot manufactures to innovate. In 2015 we aggressively trialed new table game products, such as side bets and new games, which are now on 15% of our retail tables, as we continually look for exciting new games to enhance the flavor experience and give them more choices and chances to win. Specifically, we recognized a growth opportunity in proprietary table game side bets and have made good progress in creating, patterning and launching several new side bet options over the last couple of years. Additionally, in order to engage tech-savvy millennials, we are working to create a more social, on-property experience by evolving our core design. With substantial modernization, we are attempting to create spaces that better integrate gaming and hospitality, and that maximize a group's ability to stay and play together. In addition to the TAG Sports Bar in O'Sheas Casino, Las Vegas and Bally's Wild Wild West Casino in Atlantic City, we will be building new pilot environment in at least two locations to trial customer experience and engagement in a more social setting. We are also making a concerted effort to expand and enhance our gaming product offerings in these millennial-friendly environments, by developing and deploying games for skill-based components. More to come soon on that front. And finally, we believe that the pace of innovation on the part of primary slot manufactures has been slow and have been pushing for the modernization of their product offerings. However, there are select new products that are driving improved performance and some of the target demographics we just mentioned. As an example, one of our main manufactures have been quickly developing slot designed to appeal the younger generations by incorporating some of the biggest most relevant brands today. While this type of product innovation will not drive meaningful change for our industry, slot games featuring Britney Spears and hit shows such as Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory are consistently landing the top 20 millennial handle pool games on our floors. Therefore, we will continue to invest in the floor, where we see meaningful opportunities. Let me now turn the call over to Eric for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll first start with continuing CEC's consolidated results for the fourth quarter of 2015, followed by a review of the company's reportable segments, and then discuss the supplemental information we have provided on our website, which include CEOC's fourth quarter performance as well as continuing CEC plus CEOC results. Slide 17 summarizes continuing CEC results, not including CEOC, which is no longer consolidated. For the fourth quarter of 2015, continuing CEC net revenues increased 9% to $1.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 52% to $305 million. On a per share basis, continuing CEC earned approximately $40 per share compared to a loss last year, which is largely due to $7.1 billion gain from the deconsolidation of CEOC in the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by a $1.1 billion charge to support the ongoing restructuring effort. Given these adjustments to earnings per share, our underlying year-over-year performance is most accurately represented through a strong adjusted EBITDA improvement. As Mark noted earlier, revenue performance was driven by strength in hospitality offerings as well as continued conversion in CIE's social and mobile games business. Specifically, growth in the hotel vertical was mainly due to higher room revenues at The LINQ Hotel, increased group room nights across our Las Vegas portfolio, resulting in our greatest annual group revenue since 2008 and resort fees driving higher cash ADR. The year-over-year improvement in EBITDA was primarily driven by net revenue increases, marketing and operational efficiencies and improved hotel customer mix. Slide 18 highlights the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties. Fourth quarter net revenues increased 3% to $517 million due to strong hotel performance driven by an increase in resort fees and improved hotel pricing power, higher food and beverage revenues and a positive impact from the recently opened Harrah's Atlantic City Waterfront Conference Center. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 41% to $145 million, with margins expanding 745 basis points year-over-year due to marketing and operational efficiencies and a year-over-year decrease in bad debt expense. For the quarter there was an unfavorable impact of less than $5 million from hold, and for the full year hold was estimated to have a favorable impact between $12 million and $17 million. Turning to Caesars Growth Partners on Slide 19. CGP experienced another strong quarter. For the business as a whole, fourth quarter net revenues increased 14% to $600 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 52% to $157 million and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 662 basis points year-over-year. Revenue performance was driven by higher room revenues due to the renovations at The LINQ Hotel, which were completed earlier this year, the expansion of resort fees, strong organic growth in CIE's social and mobile games business and increased casino revenues at Horseshoe Baltimore. Within the CGP business, I'll first go over the CGP Casino segment in detail on Slide 20. CGP Casinos delivered fourth quarter net revenues of $392 million, growing 6% due to strong room revenue in The LINQ Hotel and Casino and the expansion of resort fees, offset by continued revenue from Harrah's New Orleans due to the smoking ban. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 40% to $80 million, due to net revenue increases and marketing and operational cost efficiencies. For the quarter there was an unfavorable impact of less than $5 million from hold, and for the full year the estimated impact from favorable hold was between $10 million and $15 million. Harrah's New Orleans continues to adjust to the operational challenges from the smoking ban that went into effect in April of 2015. Since that time while volumes have fluctuated month-to-month, we've experienced on average roughly a 10% decline in gross gaming revenues. We're focused on mitigating the negative impact on our revenues to the extent possible by developing outdoor smoking patios that provide a more convenient alternative to our smoking guests, and that will have limited slot machine play. These patios in gaming are subject to certain state and city approvals. On Slide 21, we look at the Interactive Entertainment business, which we've spoken about frequently in 2015, as being a consistent contributor to our topline, due to increased conversion of the user base. Fourth quarter net revenues increased 33% to $208 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 67% to $77 million. EBITDA margins expanded 753 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, average monthly unique paying users grew from approximately 858,000 -- sorry, grew to approximately 858,000 from 657,000 in the same quarter last year. And the average revenue per user per day increased to $0.34 from $0.28 over that same period. Slide 22 shows the supplemental information on CEOC's fourth quarter performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 44% to $246 million and EBITDA margins increased 698 basis points year-over-year. This increase was driven by a decline in direct casino expenses due to less promotional activities across properties and lower payroll cost, offsetting a 2% decrease in net revenues from the prior year to $1.1 billion. The EBITDA contribution from the favorable year-over-year hold for the quarter was between $12 million and $17 million and was between $50 million and $55 million for the year. In Las Vegas, hospitality amenities continued to perform well at Caesars Palace. The Julius Tower renovation took over 570 rooms offline at Caesars Palace during the fourth quarter of 2015, causing a slight quarterly decline in hotel revenues. These rooms are steadily coming back online in the current quarter. Consistent with the rest of the industry, we continue to see a challenging VVIP environment in Las Vegas, and we are anticipating flat baccarat volumes throughout 2016. In 2015, CEOC's regional markets experienced lower gross gaming revenues due to marketing program modification that have been implemented over the last nine months, with retail guest visitations showing notable declines. Despite the gross gaming revenue impact, we believe these modifications are profit enhancing and have not deteriorated our net market position, as evidenced by market share data. As noted on last quarter's call, by mid-2016 certain CEOC subsidiaries will transition the management responsibility of Horseshoe Cleveland, Horseshoe Cincinnati and ThistleDown Racino over to Rock Gaming and its subsidiaries, which currently own the three properties. We are working with Rock Gaming to ensure seamless transition and are taking the appropriate steps to minimize any disruption to customers. Although reward credits for total reward members can no longer be earned at these properties after the transition, existing reward credits will remain valid at Caesars Entertainment properties. On Slide 23, we will now review the supplemental information for the entire enterprise, representing continuing CEC plus CEOC for the quarter. Caesars Entertainment-wide net revenues increased 3.6% to $2.2 billion, mainly due to strong hotel revenue growth from pricing strength, particularly at the LINQ Hotel continued strong performance in the social games business at CIE and favorable year-over-year hold. We also expanded resort fees to include all of our hotels system-wide and increased fees at fees properties, which is a key driver of the 12.7% increase in cash ADR we experienced during the quarter. Revenue growth coupled with ongoing expense reductions, particularly around both marketing and labor efficiencies, resulted in adjusted EBITDA rising 48% to $549 million and EBITDA margins expanding 741 basis points year-over-year. During the quarter, positive year-over-year hold contributed approximately $10 million to $15 million and bringing the full year impact from positive hold to between $80 million and $85 million on a year-over-year basis. While our properties benefited from favorable hold in the full year 2015 period, we do expect this to normalize over time. Looking ahead, we expect to face headwinds related to inflationary cost increases, including salary and benefits, and we'll be focused on offsetting these to increase productivity efforts. Our marketing and operational efficiency programs begin to annualize, year-over-year comparisons will become more difficult. We also continue to be adversely impacted by restructuring efforts, as we navigate the bankruptcy process. This is largely in the form of elevated expenses across numerous parts of our business, which may accelerate over time. Slide 24 provides a snapshot of liquidity and capital expenditure at the quarter end for the CEC consolidated entities. The strength of our operating performance has driven strong cash flow generation and will enable continued reinvestment in these businesses. We continue to take a thoughtful approach on how to deploy our capital, ensuring it's invested on high-return projects. I'll now turn it over to Mark for his closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks Eric. And as I said when I started today, 2015 was a strong year for Caesars, delivering the highest full year performance post financial crisis. Looking at Slide 26, you will see that exceeded our annual CEOC EBITDA target of $1 billion by $100 million, ending the year with $1.1 billion of full year EBITDA. Additionally, we exceeded our previously stated enterprise-wide goal of achieving an incremental $250 million to $300 million of EBITDA from cost savings and marketing efficiencies, delivering approximately $350 million in incremental EBITDA from these efforts. Amid the background of CEOC's restructuring process, we will continue to execute on our business plan, driving a balanced agenda of enhancing revenue growth and driving productivity gains to further improve margins and cash flow, while at the same time maintaining high-levels of employee and customer satisfaction. We improved both our annual Employee Opinion Survey and customer satisfaction scores in 2015 across the enterprise, a good validation that while we manage to drive greater efficiencies, we sustained our quality performance in terms of employees and customers. Looking briefly at January 2016 and February to date, we are encouraged by our results, as we have continued to see EBITDA margin improvement across the enterprise, as well as sequential growth in our Las Vegas region, driven by the world-renowned Consumer Electronics Show at the start of the year. However, we experienced weather-related regional pressure, given two brief property closures in the Northeast, due top winter storm Jonas. Based on these continued trends in operating performance to date, we feel confident in our ability to meet our operating goals for the rest of the year. To summarize on Slide 27, with our improved operating model, we are confident that we will continue to drive growth opportunities across our businesses in 2016 and beyond. Our team is beginning to execute on our cornerstone initiatives that will play a pivotal role in strengthening our foundation and positioning us for future value creation. These initiatives include : one, investing in Caesars' infrastructure to enhance long-term value; two, invigorating hospitality and loyalty marketing program; three, inspiring a sales and service culture; and finally, instituting a continuous improvement-focused operating model. By executing on these strategic initiatives and driving continuous improvement, as we continue to expect EBITDA margin expansion opportunities enterprise wide. We will now open the line for Q&A. At this time, we ask to keep your questions focused on the performance of the business and please do not ask questions about the ongoing restructuring process. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne from Goldman Sachs. Kevin Coyne : Just a quick question on 2016. It looks like you're going to renovate almost 5,000 more rooms in Las Vegas, which seems like it's continuing that accelerated pace, and you certainly have been getting great performance out of the ADR in those renovated rooms. But beyond 2016, will there be a further accelerated pace in '17 or will you revert back to a normal cadence of renovations? Mark Frissora : Yes, we expect that the cadence will continue at this kind of a pace for probably in the foreseeable future, I'll say, the next three to four year given underinvested situation, as you know, over the last five years. So there is a lot more that came from and we've got a master plan that drives it by quarter, by year, so it's good for us, because we look at it as just an opportunity to invest in low-risk, high-return room refurbs, which we're pretty good at, and certainly, in the Vegas and most destination markets, you get a very high return on. Kevin Coyne : And I may have missed this in all the commentary, but have you stated in those renovated rooms what the incremental room rate you're getting is on a percentage basis? Mark Frissora : It varies by property, but Eric, I don't know if you want any general guidelines that we give at all? Eric Hession : Sure, I can just give you some context, Kevin. When we renovate rooms substantially and change the branding of the tower, we then tend to be able to charge an enhanced premium something in the range of $48, $45. When it's a standard room renovation project where we don't necessarily change the theme of the room or just simply upgrade it, then we're kind of more in that $20 to $25 range, so it's a blend of those two, depending on what we decide to do with the particular tower and property. Kevin Coyne : Just turning to your comments on skills-based gaming, I believe I heard you mentioned that you're working to develop skills-based gaming. And I just wanted to clarify is Caesar's directly spending on that initiative or is that just an informal partnership with your gaming equipment vendors? Mark Frissora : We're not investing in skills-based gaming in terms of -- we don't have standalone projects on that at all. We are doing side bets and we do develop our own table side bet games and we patent some of those, but nothing on skills-based games per se. Kevin Coyne : And in your commentary you mentioned that, Las Vegas was up in January sequentially due to CES, but was it also up year-over-year as well? Mark Frissora : It was up year-over-year, Kevin. Kevin Coyne : And just my final question. I noticed the commentary didn't necessarily mention the High Roller. You did touch on the LINQ in terms of the F&B line up in terms of some new product coming in there, but I guess we've always thought that the wheel would ultimately have some potential for corporate and group events, and I'm not asking for specific performance stats, but can you tell us or give us any color in terms of how you feel about the performance to date and is there a push to get better performance out of that asset? Mark Frissora : The wheel, as we mentioned before, Kevin, we provided a glimpse into the number of riders, that's generally consistent with that from the previous period. We do get a significant amount of group business and tour and travel business to join the wheel. One of the areas where we've seen particularly strong traction is with our Happy Half Hour promotion, where we have a bar cart in the wheel. And with it up-sell price on the ticket, customers can ride the wheel and have drinks while they are going around on the ride. So those efforts are definitely underway. It still drives a significant amount of business to the promenade and to the casinos that we have surrounding the wheel. And then from a return on investment perspective, we're pleased with the return from the initial capital investment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Susan Berliner : So I wanted to start with -- I know in your presentation, you put for both CGPH casinos and CERP an unfavorable impact flat to $5 million. So I guess I was kind of curious why is it flat to $5 million? Is there a more precise? Mark Frissora : So I'll address that. If you notice whenever we present a hold impact, we always provide a range. And part of the reason why we provide the range is because a predicted hold when you're talking about table games volatility has a number of factors including game mix, rules associated with the game, certain discounts and promotions that we offer and so we provide a range. It just happens that in this case the hold was modestly negative and our point estimate fell between the $0 million and $5 million range, so that's the range we provided. Susan Berliner : And then when you talked about the bad debt expense from last year, can you just clarify exactly in CERP, was that added back? I assume that was added back to EBITDA last year, making it look higher, is that right? Mark Frissora : No, it's the other way around. So it was not added back last year. We called it out last year as an item that was negatively impacting it. So this year's performance wouldn't have that associated bad debt expense. Susan Berliner : And then just turning to CapEx. Can you help at all with, I guess, when some of these rooms will come out at some of your bigger room renovations? Mark Frissora : When you say come out meaning have the construction projects be completed, so the rooms are back? Susan Berliner : Yes. Or when they started, when they came out and when they're coming back in? Mark Frissora : Yes. So we have a number of the room renovation projects underway. The Planet Hollywood phase one, which is a modest number of rooms we expect to be concluded this quarter, and then the large number will be concluded in the fourth quarter of this year. For Paris, again, we have the three projects that's currently underway that will be done also in this quarter and then the larger room products in the third quarter. You've heard us talk about the Julius Tower and we started the renovation in that on the fourth quarter and so the rooms are coming back at a regular pace now and we had sizeable percentage back for New Year's of last year. And then at Harrah's, we have a full tower down right now of around 600 rooms and that's expected to come back in the second quarter of 2016. So what we try to do is to space the room renovations, so that we as a market, from a market-wide perspective have a relatively constant amount of rooms out of service at any one time such that it doesn't negatively impact our ability to yield the hotel and can still run sizably high occupancies on the weekends, when we need the capacity. Susan Berliner : And then just turning to the AC Convention Center, if you guys can provide a little bit of color of what you're seeing there? And also are you still expecting to get reimburse from the CRDA or is that not with everything going on in AC not going to happen? Mark Frissora : So to answer that second question, the CRDA reimbursements were done, as the money was spent. So I think it was on every roughly $2 that we would spend, we'd get reimbursed a dollar on a month delay, something like that. And so to the extent that there is risk there, there maybe some few dollars remaining as we close up the project, but nothing substantial in terms of risk that we wouldn't get money from the CRDA. Overall, the convention center is performing exceptionally well and beyond our expectations. We continue to see very solid bookings. We anticipate that at the end of this quarter and as we head into the summer, we will start to see the number of actual room nights that are occupied pick up. As you know, convention here's typically don't have reluctance to book right around the time of opens of convention centers, because of the risk of delay to their project. But now that we've been open for five or six months those are starting to come in. And the feedback, we're getting continues to be very strong. The demand as we have mentioned before is also very strong in the Northeast corridor, and so we expect this project to be a very high-return, high-value projects for both the Harrah's Atlantic City and for the city. Susan Berliner : My last question just has to do with margins, I guess, going into 2016. I know you had cited in one of the slides that you had inflationary cost pressures, but I know you also said margins were up so far. So I guess is there any guidance you can give with regards to what kind of additional improvement you can get from here? Mark Frissora : I think we did say that we expected margin expansion, that's probably as aggressive as we want to get at this point in the year, given that the economy and other factors come into place. So we'll just feel good about our performance to date and feel positive enough to say that we expect margin expansion during the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Farber from Credit Suisse. David Farber : I had a couple of questions. I wanted to just touch first in Las Vegas. It appears you're sort of on [ph] parity now with the strip in ADR after a number of years of lagging. So I was curious to hear how much more you think you can drive RevPAR in the Vegas portfolio? And maybe somewhat related to that is what your outlook is for Vegas RevPAR at '16? And then I had a couple of follow-ups. Eric Hession : Sure. We don't provide direct guidance, Dave, so I'll pass on that question. But what I can say is that our ADR increases despite having them been quite rapid over the last three years, we're still below our 2007 peak level. We're also below that of our peer set, when we look at our comparable assets. We believe there are a number of factors that drive that. Some are our operational efforts that we're undertaking to improve that, but others are capital-intensive, as we've mentioned and we're addressing the capital as Mark mentioned over the next three to four years and trying to improve the operational aspects that would help us get up to parity as quickly as we can. David Farber : The presentation has I think $350 million of incremental EBITDA related to cost savings and a lot of the marketing efficiencies. I was curious, if you think there is substantially more savings to come in your finding over the year? And what your thoughts are there? And then I had one last question. Eric Hession : I think that we are focused on improving productivity every year in the company. So we're developing a culture, where we try every year to figure out how to be more efficient. And this is why we had a great last year. Obviously, the rate of improvement is going to slow. But we still expect to find efficiency in our operations. We've got plans to do so. And we think we can find more ways to be efficient both in operations as well as in the marketing area and have plans to do so. We have a healthy set of initiatives this year that are offsetting those inflationary pressures that normal businesses have, and as well as the growth that we have planned for this year. So yes, we're feeling pretty good about productivity and hopefully this will be something that we'll be able to talk to for years to come. David Farber : My last question, I was just curious, if you guys consider any bond buybacks in entities outside of CEOC given some of the returns potentially there versus some other uses of capital, any thoughts there given where paper is trading currently? And that's it from me. Eric Hession : Yes. I think unfortunately, David, we can't address that question either talking about the capital structure at this point. We'll pass and you'll have to wait until we're done with the restructuring to really address any other capital structure questions. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Brian Blackman for final comments. End of Q&A Brian Blackman : Well, we'd like to just wrap up and thank everyone for joining us on today's call. And we look forward to checking back in for our first quarter in a few months. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for joining us. This does conclude our webcast. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

My name is Ian, and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today\u2019s webcast is being recorded. We will have a question-and-answer session at the end of today\u2019s presentation, and instructions on how to ask a question will be given at the appropriate time. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Brian Blackman, Vice President, Investor Relations with Caesars Entertainment. Brian, the floor is yours. Brian Blackman : Good afternoon, and welcome to Caesars Entertainment First Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, certain earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site at caesars.com. The slides are available for download and will accompany Mark and Eric's prepared remarks for those of you on the phone that would like to follow along. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of this afternoon's press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and will shortly file our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016. Before we get underway, I would like to call your attention to certain statements and information on slides 1 through 4, which we incorporate by this reference. Forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimer and our public documents cover this call and the simultaneous webcast at caesars.com. This call, the webcast and its replay are the property of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It's not for rebroadcast or use by any other party without the prior written consistent of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect now. By remaining on the line, you agree to be bound by these terms. Today's call will include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, property EBITDA and certain supplemental financial information. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures and the reasons management believe these measures provided useful information for investors can be found on Slide 3 and in the appendix to this presentation, beginning on Slide 26. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners, which includes two reportable segments, CGP Casinos and CIE. CEC also has a majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, but CEC's financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15 of 2015. However, in addition to a review of CEC's reported financial information on this call, we will also discuss certain supplemental information regarding CEOC, including certain remarks that combine CEOC's results with those of CEC. CEC has committed to a material amount of payments to support CEOC restructuring, which would result in a reacquisition of CEOC\u2019s operations if the restructuring is made on terms consistent with the current Restructuring Support Agreement for which CEC is a party. As a result, this non-GAAP supplemental financial information is presented as a benefit for users to understand the results of the entire Caesars enterprise, including CEOC and consistent with the management services provided across the systems property. This information is not preferable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in our presentation. The results are not indicative of future performance or the results post restructuring. As used during the call, the words company Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our and us refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities, unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. As seen on today's agenda on Slide 5, we'll begin the call today with some remarks by Mark, whose comments will generally relate to the entire Caesars system, including our deconsolidated subsidiary CEOC. Eric will then review our financial results, before Mark concludes with some closing comments. I'd now like to open up the call and Mark, the call is yours. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Brian. I\u2019m pleased to report that Caesars Entertainment delivered another strong first quarter in 2016 building on last year\u2019s great results. Starting on Slide 6, net revenues for continuing CEC, which excludes CEOC, increased 7% to $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 16% to $349 million. Our first quarter results include a $237 million charge related to the restructuring of CEOC. Eric will provide more details on our financial results in his prepared remarks. Looking more broadly at enterprise-wide performance, which adds CEOC to CEC, net revenues grew 4% to $2.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 14% to $653 million. Enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 263 basis points in the first quarter to 28.5%, a first quarter historical record for the enterprise as adjusted EBITDA margins were 200 basis points higher than 2007. As I have discussed in past quarters, we are focused on a balanced strategy of increasing margins and cash flows through both revenue growth and efficiency initiatives while simultaneously driving even higher levels of employee engagement and customer satisfaction. We achieved these objectives in the first quarter by delivering improved financial performance as well as solid year-over-year gains in customer service scores. Many of the drivers that we have talked about over the past four quarters continued to improve enterprise-wide performance this quarter. The Interactive Entertainment business continued to grow revenue and profit, due to a combination of increased unique paying users and growth in average revenue per user. Another key contributor to our top line growth was a strong increase in lodging revenues, particularly at the LINQ Hotel. Enterprise-wide cash ADR rose 9% due to an increase in resort fees, improved hotel yield and greater pricing power as a result of our reinvestment in the hotel product, particularly on the Las Vegas strip. Additionally, the success of the initial Jennifer Lopez\u2019s residency at Planet Hollywood contributed to an increase in the entertainment business revenues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was lower gaming revenues due to an unfavorable hold impact when comparing to the prior year period as well as softness in the Southeast properties from oil and gas related weakness. We also experienced continued pressure at Harrah's New Orleans from the smoking ban. The top line strength coupled with our ongoing efficiency initiatives enabled us to achieve enterprise-wide margin expansion. The majority of these initiatives annualized in the first quarter making year-over-year comparisons more difficult as the year progresses. Collectively, these results also begin to include the ongoing work to execute our cornerstone initiatives, which will provide a solid foundation for future progress. The cornerstone initiatives, which are listed on Slide 7, are invigorating our hospitality and loyalty marketing programs, investing in Caesars\u2019 infrastructure to enhance long-term value, instituting a continuous improvement-focused operating model and finally inspiring a sales and service culture. Before I turn the call over to Eric, let me update you on these four priorities which will be critical components of our business transformation. Turning to the first cornerstone initiative on Slide 8, we are implementing actions to enhance our hospitality and loyalty programs including total rewards with the goal of expanding our customer base and enhancing our member benefits. To derive even more benefits from the program, we are focused on increasing distribution of the total rewards database, which increases the value for every property in our system. Additionally, we continually look for ways to strengthen the value proposition of our rewards program. For example, we recently announced a new marketing alliance with the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas. As a result of this arrangement, Caesars will offer a Las Vegas style island gaming destination as a new benefit to our total rewards members. Investing in our infrastructure is another key priority and we have focused this investment on our hotel, entertainment and food and beverage offerings as shown on slides 9 through 11. On the lodging front, there is particular focus in the Las Vegas market, which continues to experience strong growth and key towards [ph] some indicators with year-over-year increases in visitation, occupancy and ADR rates. At the end of the first quarter, we had completed approximately 29% of the more than 4,800 planned room renovations in Las Vegas for 2016. Enterprise-wide, we have completed approximately 32% of the more than 5,700 planned room upgrades. The completed renovations at our various Las Vegas properties are receiving positive customer reviews. Further, they have been a meaningful contributor to our improved financial performance demonstrating that our Las Vegas hotel investments are paying off. As we conclude room renovations, we anticipate a ripple effect of increases in gaming, food and beverage and other ancillary revenue in addition to improvements in our key hotel metrics of cash ADR and room revenue. However, as is common with any renovation project, there will inevitably be some inventory disruption while rooms are out of service, which we will work to mitigate. We are also differentiating our hotel offering on the strip by using technology to deepen our connection with customers. Last year, we piloted a self-service check-in kiosk at three hotels in Las Vegas to expedite the guest arrival process. As a result of positive customer reviews and reduced check-in times, we are planning to deploy additional kiosk to another five properties later this year. Beyond our room product, we are actively investing in other hospitality channels such as entertainment to ensure our properties remain a preferred destination in Las Vegas. As I mentioned earlier, entertainment revenue was a contributor to our performance in the first quarter. With the launch of new residencies with Jennifer Lopez and Lionel Richie as well as extensions with Britney Spears and Pitbull, we have increased the number of shows at Planet Hollywood by around 30% in 2016 compared to the last year. We continue to explore options to diversify and enhance our Las Vegas entertainment lineup in ways which will appeal to guests of all age groups in taste. Along with entertainment investments, we continually evaluate and refresh our food and beverage offerings as another way to increase traffic to our Las Vegas properties. In March, we opened the Montecristo Cigar Bar at Caesars Palace offering guests premium cigars, food, cocktails and spirits in a contemporary and inviting space. Most recently, we announced that In-N-Out Burger we joined a lineup of new dining outlets opening at the LINQ Promenade later this fall. This will be the very first shift location for this extremely popular burger brand. We believe it will rapidly become a popular choice for loyal In-N-Out fans as well as first-time visitors who are looking for a high-quality quick dining experience. The third cornerstone initiative on Slide 12 is our continuous improvement-focused operating model. Over the last year and into the first quarter of 2016, we have begun engineering a more efficient and productive enterprise through various marketing and operational initiatives. On the marketing front, we continued to improve overall customer yields by leveraging a more sophisticated approach to incentives. Operationally, we have assembled a focused executive team to direct the lean efficiency program. These initiatives are expected to remain a high priority for our management team throughout 2016 and beyond. Lastly, as seen on Slide 13, we are instilling a sales and service culture focus throughout the enterprise to enhance the guest experience and customer loyalty. We have already trained a significant proportion of new employees on new marketing tools, including sales training which empowers them to recommend appealing ancillary products, services and experiences. These actions have resulted in improved year-over-year customer satisfaction as measured by Q1 2016 customer service and net promoter scores. Moving to Slide 14, as we look to the future, we foresee that gaming innovation will be an essential tool to transform the casino industry\u2019s growth trajectory. Our strategy is twofold. First, create unique, appealing gaming environments unlike traditional gambling floors and second, deploy distinctive, innovative games unlike traditional casino products. While we are still in an easy phase of this journey, we are investing in the on-property experience with test pilot programs, working with vendors to deliver new games with skilled based components and aggressively trailing new products. We are partnering with some of the most innovative consumer space designers to create a new environment within the casino. We believe that creating a casino of the future could also help reenergize the core slot player while concurrently attracting and engaging millennial and Gen X customers. I look forward to updating you as we make more progress on this potentially transformational objective. Let me now turn the call over to Eric for a more detailed review of this quarter\u2019s results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start with a review of continuing CEC\u2019s consolidated results followed by a review of the company\u2019s reportable segments and supplemental information, which include CEOC\u2019s performance as well as continuing CEC plus CEOC results. Slide 16 summarizes continuing CEC\u2019s results, which does not include CEOC as it is no longer consolidated. For the first quarter of 2016, continuing CEC net revenues rose 7% to $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 16% to 349 million with a margin increase of 239 basis points. This translated into a diluted loss per share for continuing CEC of approximately $2.12 compared to a diluted earnings per share of $46.12 in the year ago period. Earnings performance was primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of CEOC in the first quarter of 2015 and an additional accrual of 237 million in the current quarter related to CEC\u2019s estimate of the amount it will pay to support the restructuring of CEOC as negotiations among all parties associated with the restructuring are ongoing, this amount will likely change. As such, we believe our operational performance is best represented by the strong improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Revenue in the quarter was driven primarily by organic growth in the social and mobile games within our Interactive Entertainment business and strong hospitality growth, particularly in Las Vegas. This was partially offset by lower gaming volumes with the non-Las Vegas properties and an unfavorable hold impact on a year-over-year basis. On the hospitality side, the business experienced a 12% increase in room revenues mainly due to the growth at the LINQ Hotel. Cash ADR grew 10% as a result of improved hotel yield, increases in cash resort fees following the expansion to all properties in 2015 and a stronger pricing environment in Las Vegas. We also saw increased demand for entertainment and food and beverage offerings at our strip properties. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to net revenue increases, improved hotel customer mix and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a positive adjusted EBITDA impact of between $0 million and $5 million in the quarter relative to our expectations, but an unfavorable $0 million to $5 million adjusted EBITDA impact when comparing to the prior year period. Turning to Slide 17 in the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties. First quarter net revenues were flat year-over-year at 528 million as lower slot gaming volumes at our non-Las Vegas properties and Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas were offset by strong hotel cash ADR performance due to the resort fees and improved hotel yield, and to a lesser extent other revenue increases driven by Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City conference center. Construction disruption affected revenues at Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas as we had a number of rooms out of service from the renovations taking place at the property. Adjusted EBITDA at CERP declined 3% year-over-year to 158 million and margins declined 76 basis points. The decline in EBITDA was primarily attributable to lower gaming revenues and higher labor expenses, which more than offset the benefits from marketing efficiencies and improved hotel customer mix. A meaningful portion of the increase in labor expenses at CERP was related to the ramp up of the Atlantic City convention center. As the conference center fully ramps, we expect to become more efficient in our labor management and hotel yielding capitalizing on the project\u2019s strong bookings. Hold was estimated to have a positive adjusted EBITDA impact of between 0 million and 5 million for the quarter relative to our expectations and there was a minimal impact when comparing to the prior year period. Slide 18 summarizes the performance of Caesars Growth Partners, which experienced a strong quarter. Net revenues rose 14% to 644 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 31% to 194 million. Margins expanded 402 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Revenue performance was driven primarily by organic growth in CIE\u2019s mobile and social games business and higher hotel revenues at the LINQ Hotel, which had 82% more hotel rooms online in the quarter compared to the prior year as a result of the renovations completed in the second quarter of 2015. Looking at the CGP Casino Properties segment within the CGP business on Slide 19, net revenues were 416 million for the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year. This performance was primarily attributable to higher hotel revenues at the LINQ Hotel, which experienced a 21% lift year-over-year in cash ADR due to the renovations as well as higher food and beverage and gaming revenues and increases in entertainment revenue at Planet Hollywood. This was partially offset by ongoing revenue pressure at Harrah\u2019s New Orleans as the property has experienced double digit declines in gross gaming revenues since the city\u2019s smoking ban went into effect. Adjusted EBITDA for the CGP Casino segment increased 24% to $105 million and margins expanded 345 basis points due to net revenue increases and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a minimal negative adjusted EBITDA impact in the quarter relative to our expectations and an unfavorable 0 million to 5 million adjusted EBITDA impact when comparing to the prior year period. Looking ahead, Harrah\u2019s New Orleans annualized the smoking ban in late April, so the expected declines in gross gaming revenues and corresponding declines in EBITDA to moderate. Additionally, we expect growth at the LINQ Hotel to revert to more normalized levels starting in the second quarter as the property will annualize the renovations in May. Moving to Slide 20 in the Interactive Entertainment business, first quarter net revenue increased 29% to 228 million and adjusted EBITDA rose 41% to 89 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 344 basis points year-over-year. Performance was mainly driven by strong results in the social and mobile games due to a combination of increased unique paying users and growth in average revenue per user. Monthly unique paying users grew to 922,000 in the first quarter, up from 762,000 last year and average revenue per day increased to $0.35 from $0.31 in the prior period. Slide 21 shows the supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s first quarter performance. Net revenues were relatively flat year-over-year at $1.2 billion as positive hold at London Clubs International properties was offset by unfavorable hold at Caesars Palace in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to 304 million leading to a 289 basis point increase on margins primarily due to marketing efficiencies, higher collections on markers and favorable property taxes. Hold was estimated to have a positive adjusted EBITDA impact between $5 million and $10 million for the quarter relative to our expectation but an unfavorable $5 million to $10 million adjusted EBITDA impact when comparing to the prior year period. Hospitality amenities at Caesars Palace continue to perform well. The rebranded Julius Tower has received positive feedback from both returning and new customers with all but one floor of suites now completed. Conversely, the challenging VVIP environment continues to adversely affect baccarat volumes and we expect this dynamic to play out for the remainder of 2016. At the end of the first quarter, certain CEOC subsidiaries transitioned the management responsibility of ThistleDown Racino over to Rock Gaming and its subsidiaries. Horseshoe Casino and Horseshoe Cleveland will transition at the end of the second quarter. Now let\u2019s take a look at additional supplemental information for the entire enterprise for the first quarter on Slide 22, which includes CEOC. Caesars enterprise-wide net revenues rose 4% from the prior year to $2.3 billion mainly on strong performance in the social and mobile games business at CIE and hospitality growth in Las Vegas primarily in lodging. This was partially offset by an unfavorable hold impact year-over-year. As noted earlier, the growth in room revenue is mainly attributable to the performance of the LINQ Hotel as well as strong cash ADR growth due to resort fees, improved hotel yield and pricing strength. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% year-over-year to $653 million and margins increased 263 basis points primarily attributable to the net revenue increases, improved hotel customer mix and efficiency initiatives. Though we experienced some inflationary cost pressures including salary and benefits in the first quarter, we were able to manage these pressures through our continuous improvement efforts. We expect these headwinds to persist and we will remain vigilant in offsetting these increases. Hold was estimated to have a positive adjusted EBITDA impact of between $10 million and $15 million in the quarter relative to our expectation but an unfavorable $10 million and $15 million adjusted EBITDA impact when comparing to the prior period. Looking ahead, though we experienced margin expansion in the first quarter related to our improved operating model, year-over-year comparisons become more challenging as the year progresses. The majority of the efficiency programs that led to our outstanding performance in 2015 were fully implemented in the first quarter of 2015. We also expect to be adversely affected by ongoing restructuring efforts, largely in the form of elevated expenses across many parts of our business, which may accelerate during the remainder of this year. Lastly, ongoing room renovations across our hotel portfolio will result in inventory disruptions, which we will attempt to mitigate. On Slide 23, you can see a summary of quarter end liquidity and projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. As you may recall, CEC is a holding company and as such is a non-cash generating entity. While the cash forecast at CEC currently contemplates liquidity to be sufficient through the end of the year. If CEOC does not emerge from bankruptcy on a timely basis, CEC cash balance will be consumed by the expenses associated with the CEOC restructuring unless we identify additional sources of liquidity to meet CEC\u2019s ongoing obligations as well as to meet its commitments to support the CEOC restructuring. Within our subsidiaries, CERP and CGP, the improvement in our financial performance has led to strong cash flow generation enabling reinvestment in high return projects such as room renovations. We are focused on increasing cash flow and specifically adjusted EBITDA as we believe this drive long-term value. We will do this by being more productive through our continuous improvement-focused operating model in addition to taking a thoughtful approach to capital allocation. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments now. Mark Frissora : Thanks, Eric. Summarizing our discussion on Slide 25, we are pleased with this quarter\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin growth, and our ability to drive operational growth and efficiency year-over-year. Hospitality was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. We expect hospitality to remain a business driver as our upgraded room products come online and as positive Las Vegas trends are projected to continue. That said, we recognize the importance of enhancing core gaming growth and we are focused on offering more compelling gaming products in new and exciting environments. Furthermore, our marketing and operational efficiency initiatives have established a baseline for our business. As we ramp up our lean efficiency program in 2016, we will identify incremental and sustainable process efficiencies, which will also enable us to upgrade the customer experience and enhance employee engagement. Looking briefly at April, the business performed well, particularly in Las Vegas driven by strong hotel demand. As we move to the second quarter, we continue to focus on margin management through the implementation of continuous improvement techniques and an acceleration of our revenue initiatives. As always, amid the backdrop of ongoing restructuring efforts at CEOC, we are focused on operating as efficiently as possible to maximize value for all stakeholders. We will now open up the line for Q&A. We\u2019d ask that you keep your questions focused on the business performance. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hi. Good afternoon. Mark Frissora : Hi, Susan. Susan Berliner : So I wanted to start with I guess CapEx spend at the various entities for the quarter and I guess specifically on CERP as well \u2013 if you can give it for all three, but specifically on CERP, can you talk about the impact from room renovations? Can you quantify that at all and also help us think about the rest of the year? Mark Frissora : Sure, Sue. From an impact standpoint, we did have a large quantity of rooms out of order due to the renovations primarily at Caesars Palace and at Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas. We didn\u2019t quantify the impact of that but we obviously tried to mitigate it through revenue management techniques. It was, however, in our view slightly larger than we had originally anticipated. And as we move throughout the year, we\u2019re going to learn from the revenue management opportunities to ensure that that doesn\u2019t repeat itself in future quarters. From a CapEx standpoint, you\u2019ll see on the CapEx that we guided by credit, we did reduce our CapEx guidance slightly for CERP and CGP mainly due to timing. Also CES, we reduced fairly significantly and on that what we\u2019re realizing is that a lot of the information technology initiatives are moving from posted initiatives into cloud-based solutions, so they\u2019re more expense oriented than capital. And then CEOC was largely the same, slightly higher than we had projected at the end of the quarter. Susan Berliner : And can you give us the actual amounts you spent at each entity? Jacqueline Beato : Yes. Hi, Sue. It\u2019s Jacquie. How are you? Susan Berliner : Good, Jacquie. Welcome back. Jacqueline Beato : Thanks. CERP were at 26.5, CGP 18.9, CES 4.7. Susan Berliner : Great. And then I didn\u2019t see \u2013 I saw you guys put revolver balances but I didn\u2019t see actual debt balances and I guess specifically for CERP, the cash came in a lot higher. So I guess if you could help us with what the debt balances were at least at CERP and CGPH? And why is the cash balance I guess so much higher? I know you have that coupon payment but I\u2019m assuming you had [indiscernible] during the quarter? Eric Hession : Yes, Sue, this is Eric. The amortization would have been the only reductions in the debt balances other than revolver repayments that you can see. I think you\u2019re probably referring to the ECF offer -- Susan Berliner : Yes. Eric Hession : And we did not make any ECF repurchases due to the calculation and in particular the fact that it included committed CapEx that\u2019s anticipated to be spent in 2016 and future years. So that\u2019s the reason why ECF payments weren\u2019t required. We\u2019ll use the cash, as we\u2019ve talked about, for reinvestment in our facilities and also to pay down our revolver and such. Susan Berliner : Okay, great. So I guess the debt balance is just the revolver and the terms on amortization that\u2019s it. That would be the only change. Eric Hession : That\u2019s correct. Susan Berliner : Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in line. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. Mark Frissora : Operator, thank you very much. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s first quarter results call and we look forward to joining you for the second quarter report later on in a few months. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, certain earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section on our Web site at caesars.com. The slides are available for download and will accompany Mark and Eric\u2019s prepared remarks for those of you on the phone that would like to follow along. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of this afternoon\u2019s press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and will shortly file our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016. Before we get underway, I would like to call your attention to certain statements and information on slides one through four, which we incorporate by this reference. The forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers in our public documents cover this call in a simultaneous webcast at caesars.com. This call, the webcast, and its replay are the property of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It\u2019s not for rebroadcast or use by any other party without the prior written consent of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect now. By remaining on the line, you agree to be bound by these terms. Today's call will include a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, proper EBITDA and certain supplemental financial information. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures, and the reasons management believes these measures provide useful information for investors can be found on slide three and in the appendix to this presentation beginning on slide 26. These non-GAAP measures are not preferable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in the presentation or discussed on the conference call. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities \u2013 Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners which includes two reportable segments, CGP Casinos and CIE. CEC also has a majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company. But CEC\u2019s financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15 of 2015. However, in addition a review of CEC\u2019s reported financial information on this call, we will also discuss certain supplemental financial information regarding CEOC, including certain remarks that combine CEOC\u2019s results for those of CEC, and CEC has committed to a material amount of payments to support CEOC restructuring, which would result in the reacquisition of CEOC\u2019s operations if the restructuring is made on terms consistent with the current restructuring support agreement to which CEC is a party. As a result, this non-GAAP supplemental financial information is presented as a benefit for users to understand the results of the entire Caesars enterprise, including CEOC and consistent management services provided across all properties. The results are not indicative of future performance or the results post-restructuring. As used during this call, the words company, Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our and [indiscernible] refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. As seen on today's agenda on slide five, we\u2019ll begin the call with some remarks by Mark whose comments will generally relate to the entire Caesars Enterprise including our deconsolidated subsidiary, CEOC. Eric will then review our financial results before Mark concludes with closing comments and we will then open the call to your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Brian. I\u2019m pleased report that Caesars has continued to build on our 2015 full year and first quarter 2016 performance by posting strong second quarter results. These results continue to benefit from the strategic initiatives that we've been executing during the last year-and-a-half focused on operational efficiency and investments in our hospitality assets, which are driving improved revenue and margin performance. As seen on slide six, net revenues for CEC, which excludes CEOC, increased 8% to $1.2 billion and net income declined $2.1 billion resulting in a net loss of $2 billion. The year-over-year decline in net income was due to an accrual of approximately $2 billion related to CEC's estimate of the additional amount it will pay to support the bankruptcy of CEOC and a year-over-year increase in CIE stock-based compensation. Eric will provide further details during his remarks. Adjusted EBITDA for CEC grew 12% to $388 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 113 basis points to 31.5%. At an enterprise-wide level, which as a reminder includes CEC and CEOC performance, net revenues grew 2% to $2.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $697 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 145 basis points to 29.5%. Enterprise-wide, the key drivers of second quarter revenue and EBITDA performance were the same as those I discussed during the first quarter. We continue to experience growth in hospitality revenues, primarily lodging and entertainment in Las Vegas, with enterprise-wide cash ADR at an all-time high for the second quarter which grew 7.5% year-over-year. The Interactive Entertainment business delivered growth by increasing unique paying users and average revenue per user. These positive drivers These positive drivers were partially offset by weaker gaming volumes and regional markets, primarily in the Southeastern United States. Gaming volumes in May and June were particularly weak in the regional markets, consistent with the broader industry. This past weekend, Caesars Interactive entered into an agreement to sell Playtika, Caesars Interactive entertainment, social and mobile games business for $4.4 billion in cash. Caesars Interactive acquired Playtika in 2011. And since the company has grown into one of the largest mobile and social games companies in the world. The World Series of Poker and CIE's real money online gaming operations in the US and abroad will remain part of Caesars Interactive. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the year, will improve an already strong cash position at Caesars Growth Partners. As I have discussed in past quarters, our current cornerstone initiatives, which are listed on slide seven, are an important part of our plan to deliver additional margin expansion and cash flows. The initiatives drive revenue growth and efficiency measures, while further enhancing employee engagement and customer satisfaction. Detail on certain engagement metrics for employees and customers are reported in our 2016 Citizenship Report released this morning. The report is on our Web site and reflects the results of socially sustainable initiatives we've undertaken with our customers, our employees, our operational efficiency in the communities in which we operate. Beginning on slide eight, we are enhancing our hospitality and loyalty programs with the goals of expanding our customer base and increasing customer engagement. We\u2019ve been recognized for improving our hospitality and loyalty programs, have recently won Loyalty360 and TripAdvisor awards. The Loyalty360 awards recognize innovation and effectiveness among the world\u2019s best customer loyalty programs. In May, we received a gold award in the technology and trends category from Loyalty360 for the Total Rewards mobile app, which allows our customers to see their offers, book rooms and receive information on happenings at our properties across the entire network. Additionally, in June, 20 properties in the Caesars network earned TripAdvisor\u2019s 2016 Certificate of Excellence. We believe this recognition is attributable to our ongoing efforts to improve hotel amenities and customer service. The awards recognize excellence in hospitality and are given only to establishments that consistently achieve positive TripAdvisor reviews. A combination of our Las Vegas and regional properties are represented in the rankings with seven resorts new to the 2016 list, including Caesars Palace. Speaking of Caesars Palace, this iconic resort officially celebrates its 50th anniversary this weekend. The property has a lot to celebrate with EBITDA performance in the second quarter being the highest in its history. To commemorate the occasion, we launched a month-long series of high profile events and promotions to create excitement at the property beginning with a controlled closing of the Las Vegas Strip to host the July 4 fireworks extravaganza over Caesars Palace. The summer of Caesars festivities will culminate in a star-studded 50th anniversary gala this weekend, which I will be hosting with Howie Mandel, and will feature legendary entertainers, including a special appearance by Jennifer Lopez. Turning to slides nine and ten, investment in our infrastructure, particularly our hotel room product, is another top priority. At the end of the second quarter, we had completed approximately half of the 2016 room renovations scheduled in Las Vegas. Hotel performance in Las Vegas in the second quarter was strong, with cash ADR up approximately 7%. The pricing environment on The Strip remains favorable, supported by continued positive trends in the leisure and group market. Nationwide, we have completed approximately 60% of planned room upgrades. It\u2019s important to note that we invest in our infrastructure with efficiency, customer preferences and employee engagement in mind. As a result, all of our newly built properties are constructed to Green Building LEED standards and all of Caesars\u2019 North American hotel properties are Green Key Eco rated. We see additional opportunity to drive improvement in our hotel performance through ongoing investments and room renovations. Hotel product is an area we have been undercapitalized relative to our competitors, creating the opportunity for high returns and low-risk renovations. For example, rooms returned to service following renovations generally experience a $25 to $40 increase in cash ADR, depending on the property\u2019s peer group. In addition to increases in room revenues, we expect our room product investments to also contribute to gaming, food and beverage, and other ancillary revenue increases. We're also driving improvement in hotel performance, utilizing better yield management.  Technology is yet another area where we\u2019re investing to differentiate our hotel product on The Strip and enhance the customer experience. As you may recall, last year, at three Las Vegas hotels, we began testing self-service check-in kiosks to expedite the guest arrival process. We\u2019ve been pleased with the initial rollout and recently added additional kiosks to see Caesars Palace and Flamingo and will introduce kiosks to Paris later this month. We also began piloting a Connected Room experience in two suites at The Cromwell where guests are offered the convenience of in-room digital access to complementary and paid services, as well as guest assistance. Due to use of a handheld device, guests can manage all the aspects of their stay from controlling the lighting and thermostat in the room to ordering room service, making dinner reservations, and requesting housekeeping. The system also enables the hotel to recommend relevant products and services to the guests. During this pilot program, we will monitor customer response and assess whether to deploy the technology to additional rooms in Las Vegas. Along with our hotel upgrades, we're investing in further upgrading the quality of our food and beverage outlets as well as entertainment offerings to drive incremental traffic to our facilities, as shown on slide 11 to 13. In May, we opened Brioche by Guy Savoy at Caesars Palace, a quick-service caf\u00e9 offering, fine coffee, French pastries and sandwiches based on his successful Parisian concept. MR CHOW and the Montecristo Cigar Bar new outlets are also located at Caesars Palace and they\u2019re performing well. On the east side of The Strip, The LINQ Promenade and High Roller have delivered improved results, driven by adjustments to our marketing strategy and the tenant base. In the coming months, we will welcome several additions to the retail, dining and entertainment complex, including In-N-Out Burger, Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips, Canter's Deli, Virgil's Barbecue, and Amorino gelato, which we expect will stimulate increased visits. Entertainment continued to be a source of strength in the second quarter as customers have responded positively to the combination of our top-level talent as well as recognized venues. Due to high demand, we have recently added new dates for several of our resident headliners in 2017, including Celine Dion, Reba, Brooks & Dunn, and Elton John at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, as well as Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez at The AXIS at Planet Hollywood. Pollstar recently ranked The AXIS as the number one venue and the Colosseum as the number two venue for their respective classes in the US as measured by ticket sales during the second quarter and recognized the Jennifer Lopez All I Have residency at The AXIS as having the highest average ticket price of any tour or residency in North America during that period. Turning to our continuous improvement operating model on slide 14, we are enhancing efficiency and quality through process improvement and technology investments, such as the kiosk I mentioned earlier. Various marketing and operational programs, which I have spoken about on prior calls, are delivering success. We continue to optimize our marketing reinvestment. Consistent with our expectations, this action has contributed to lower slot gaming revenues in certain markets, but has enhanced the efficiency of our marketing spend. Further, we have been able to gain share in some of our largest and most critical markets In addition, we're generating reductions in operational expenses despite experiencing inflationary wage pressures due to union negotiations in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Some of these initiatives are outlined in our Citizenship Report. For example, our investment in health and wellness has contributed to a reduction in costs to reduce health claims. Additionally, our CodeGreen sustainability initiatives have had a significant cost-saving impact in addition to helping meet our social responsibilities. Optimizing efficiency remains a high priority for our management team. Moving to slide 15, we're creating a sales and service culture within the organization to enrich the customer experience. Employee training, including the use of an online concierge system and hotel inventory database, has been a critical element of this initiative, which has also helped drive revenue growth. Last year, we invested more than 1.6 million hours in training. Our employees are learning new technical skills to deliver more efficient service. We\u2019re also embracing new technologies to free up employee [indiscernible] engagement with guests and deliver a more personalized experience. As a result of these efforts, we once again delivered year-over-year improvement in overall service and net promoter scores in the second quarter. Additionally, the TripAdvisor\u2019s recognition, as I noted earlier, further demonstrates our progress to improve service. Service level improvements and recognition are the direct result of the hard work by our team members and their commitment to deliver the best possible service to our guests.  Finally, before I turn it over to Eric, I want to focus on our gaming innovation efforts covered on slide 16. As mentioned previously, we're focused on reenergizing the core slot player and engaging the millennial and generation X customer base through new products and games in a modernized on-property experience. Investing in technology, particularly mobile, to improve the gaming experience is another key component of this strategy. Online enrollment for the World Series of Poker entrants and mobile slot dispatch are two recent examples of technology enabling better gaming experiences. For the first time ever, the World Series of Poker has enabled players to register and pay for tournament entry fees through mobile devices and self-service kiosk, which has significantly reduced wait times. I will now ask Eric to provide a more detailed review of this quarter's results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start with a review of CEC\u2019s consolidated results followed by a review of the company's reportable segments and supplemental information, which includes CEOC\u2019s performance as well as enterprise-wide results, inclusive of CEOC. Slide 18 summarizes CEC\u2019s results, which do not include CEOC as it is no longer consolidated. For the second quarter of 2016, CEC\u2019s net revenues rose 8% to $1.2 billion. Net loss was $2 billion compared to net income of $500 million in the second quarter of 2015. Diluted loss per share for CEC was $14.25 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.10 in the year-ago period. Net income and earnings per share results were largely driven by restructuring-related accruals, which I'll discuss in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% to $388 million, with a margin increase of 113 basis points. Revenue in the quarter was driven primarily by strong growth in hospitality revenues in Las Vegas, organic growth in social and mobile games at CIE, and gaming revenue growth at Horseshoe Baltimore. This was partially offset by lower gaming revenues, primarily in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to the net revenue increases and improved hotel customer mix and efficiency initiatives. Earnings performance for CEC was primarily attributable to an accrual of approximately $2 billion in the second quarter related to CEC\u2019s estimate of the amount it will pay to support the restructuring of CEOC as well as a $66 million expense related to the fair value adjustment of CIE stock based on compensation awards. We believe our accruals represent the best estimate of our obligations under the restructuring. However, because negotiations between the various parties are ongoing and the amended plan is pending ultimate approval by the Bankruptcy Court and also pending the receipt of the required gaming regulatory approvals, our accruals are subject to change. As such, we believe our operational performance is best represented by the improvement in adjusted EBITDA. All those are estimated to have a positive effect on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expectation and there was a minimal effect when comparing to the prior-year period. Turning to slide 19 and the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, second quarter net revenues were down 1% year-over-year to $562 million. The year-over-year decline in revenues was primarily due to lower gaming volumes in Las Vegas and Atlantic City as well as unfavorable hold, partially offset by hotel revenue growth. In Las Vegas, a large part of the gaming volume decline was driven by a calendar shift in the World Series of Poker by a week from Q2 to Q3, as well as construction disruption from the room renovations at Paris Las Vegas where there are over 10,000 room nights out of service due to renovation.  Additionally, CERP\u2019s Las Vegas properties faced a tough year-over-year comparison due to the record month of hotel revenues in May of last year. In Atlantic City, Harrah's hotel and banquet revenues were a bright spot where gaming revenues continue to be challenged, primarily due to event timing, plain program scheduling and the Meeting Professionals International convention in June, which we hosted. We continue to be mindful of a softening trend in gaming revenues at this property and are taking a targeted approach to addressing certain customer segments. Service net income was down $9 million year-over-year to $8 million and net profit margin was 1.4%. The decline in net income was largely attributable to accelerated depreciation due to the ongoing room renovation projects. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2% year-over-year to $179 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins decreasing 30 basis points. The decline in EBITDA was primarily due to lower gaming revenues, which more than offset the benefits from marketing efficiencies, improved hotel customer mix and better performance of The LINQ Promenade. Hotel is estimated to have a positive effect on operating income of between zero and $5 million for the quarter relative to our expectations and an unfavorable zero to $5 million when compared to the prior-year period.  Slide 20 summarizes the performance of Caesars Growth Partners, which delivered another strong quarter. Net revenues grew 17% to $672 million. Net income decreased 60% to $15 million, equating to a net profit margin of 2.2%, with the year-over-year decline mainly driven by higher stock-based compensation expense at CIE. Adjusted EBITDA grew 33% to $214 million, with margins expanding 389 basis points year-over-year. Revenue performance was primarily driven by organic growth in CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business, gaming volume increases at Horseshoe Baltimore, and strength in hospitality revenues. Looking at the CGP Casino Properties segment within the CGP business, on slide 21, net revenues were $423 million in the second quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Revenue growth was primarily attributable to gaming revenue growth at the Horseshoe Baltimore facility, increases in entertainment revenue mainly due to The AXIS theater at Planet Hollywood, higher hotel revenues primarily The LINQ hotel, and favorable year-over-year hold. Net income increased $21 million year-over-year to $19 million, with a net profit margin of 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 25% to $114 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding 362 basis points year-over-year. EBITDA performance was mainly driven by net revenue increases and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a positive effect on operating income for the quarter of between zero and $5 million relative to our expectations and a favorable zero to $5 million effect when compared to the prior-year period. Moving to slide 22 and the Interactive Entertainment business, second quarter net revenues increased 34% to $249 million. Net income decreased $43 million to a net loss of $4 million and net profit margin was minus 1.6%, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA rose 43% to $100 million with margins increasing 253 basis points year-over-year, mainly driven by strong results in the social and mobile games business due to a combination of increased unique paying users and growth in average revenue per user. Monthly unique paying users grew to 891,000 in the second quarter, up from 796,000 last year. And average revenue per user per day increased to $0.40, up from $0.31 in the prior-year period. Slide 23 shows the supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s second quarter performance. Net revenues were $1.2 billion, down 3% year-over-year as strong gaming volumes and F&B revenue growth in our Las Vegas property were more than offset by gaming volume declines in the regional market and in our international portfolio. Caesars Palace experienced broad-based gaming revenue increases and favorable year-over-year hold. Softness in the regional markets were primarily concentrated in the southeast and mainly attributable to lower slot volumes. Our international properties experienced both unfavorable hold and lower volumes. Additionally, hotel revenues at Caesars Palace were impacted by over 19,000 room nights out of service in the quarter due to renovations at the Julius and Augustus Towers which concluded in July. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% to $309 million and margins grew 122 basis points from the prior-year period, primarily due to higher collections and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a positive effect on our operating income of between $10 million and $15 million in the quarter relative to our expectations and between zero and $5 million when compared to the prior-year period. Now, let\u2019s take a look at additional supplemental information for the entire enterprise for the second quarter on slide 24, which includes CEOC. Caesars enterprise-wide net revenues rose 2% from the prior year to $2.4 billion, mainly due to strong performance in CIE social and mobile games business; gaming revenues growth at Caesars Palace and Horseshoe Baltimore; higher hotel and entertainment revenues, primarily in Las Vegas; and favorable year-over-year hold. This was partially offset by gaming volume weakness in the regional and international market. As Mark mentioned previously, gaming volume weakness seen in regions during May and June appear to have been industrywide. Caesars\u2019 enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA increased by 8% year-over-year to $697 million and margins increased 145 basis points, primarily attributable to net revenue increases, improved hotel customer mix, and higher collections. We continue to expect inflationary cost pressures, including salaries and benefits to persist for the remainder of the year and will remain diligent in managing these pressures through our continuous improvement efforts. Hold is estimated to have a favorable effect on operating income of between $15 million and $20 million for the quarter relative to our expectations and between zero and $5 million when compared to the prior-year period. While EBITDA margins in the second quarter improved year-over-year, margin expansion has slowed as a result of more challenging comparisons as the majority of our efficiency programs were fully implemented in the first quarter of 2015. Going forward, we continue to expect to be adversely affected by ongoing restructuring efforts, largely in the form of elevated expenses across many parts of our business, which may accelerate during the remainder of this year. Lastly, ongoing room renovations across our hotel portfolio will result in inventory disruptions, which we will attempt to mitigate. Slide 25 provides a summary of quarter-end liquidity and projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. As a result of our investments in high-return low-risk areas such as room renovations and our continuous improvement operating model, the underlying performance of the enterprise continues to improve, which has resulted in greater cash flow generation. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our cash flow through efficiencies and profitable growth investments to drive value for our stakeholders. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark for his closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks, Eric. Summarizing our discussions on slide 27, we're pleased with our second quarter performance, which increasingly reflects progress executing our cornerstone initiatives. Our focus on enhancing hospitality assets is a key business performance driver, while our efficiency initiatives are enabling us to maintain the margin improvements we've achieved over the last six quarters. By continuously improving the operating model and investing in the business, we will be able to accelerate revenue growth and drive productivity gains. The goal of this approach is to further improve margins and cash flow, while also further improving customer and employee satisfaction. While macroeconomic indicators are currently mixed for consumer spending, regional gaming markets in our industry have shown some recent softness, which we will continue to monitor. Nevertheless, we are somewhat encouraged by our recent market share gains in certain markets. We will continue to stay focused on our balanced approach to running the business, an equal focus on revenue generation and cost management as well as customer and employee satisfaction. We believe that this approach, along with executing our stated strategic initiatives, is the best hedge against uncertain economic trends. As always, amid the backdrop of ongoing restructuring efforts at CEOC, we're focused on operating as efficiently as possible to maximize value for all stakeholders. Over the last several months, we\u2019ve made significant progress in the CEOC bankruptcy case, as outlined on slide 28. We\u2019re optimistic that achieving these milestones puts us on a path to resolving the unit\u2019s bankruptcy. Yesterday, we announced the signing of a new restructuring support agreement with a significant portion of CEOC second lien holders. This milestone signals continuing progress in CEOC\u2019s negotiation efforts with its lenders to bring that entity out of bankruptcy. The RSA will become effective upon the signing of the RSA by creditors holding at least 50.1% of the aggregate outstanding amount of CEOC\u2019s obligations by the end of August. Further, if consenting creditors holding at least two-thirds of the aggregate second-lien bond claims sign the RSA, we could potentially have a fully consensual deal ahead of CEOC\u2019s confirmation hearing in January. We will now open the line up for Q&A. We\u2019d ask that you please keep your questions focused on the business performance. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Susan Berliner : Hi. Thank you. So I want to start, I guess, with the consumer. I know you guys talked about the consumer gaming spend being lower in the regional markets and it sounded like it continued into July. And I was wondering if you can talk about what you're hearing from your customers. Is it just slot play? Is it at all with regards to F&B as well? Eric Hession : Sure. I\u2019ll start and then Mark can add some context. We did notice some softness in May and June and it trended a bit into July, but not as weak as we've seen in May and June. A lot of the weakness was focused around the southeastern part of the United States, which we believe is adversely affected by the oil and gas price situation. And then the rest of the central division also experienced slight weakness that was not in the same line that we have seen through the first four months of the year, which is why we mentioned it here. We also continually take an approach by evaluating all of our marketing campaigns and all of our operating strategies to try to mitigate any weakness that we see. And so, as we mentioned in the materials earlier, we\u2019ll be very vigilant to make sure that we\u2019re able to maintain our margins and that we do react appropriately as we see these threats coming through. From the Vegas perspective, though, I would say that the Vegas market, we continue to be optimistic. The demands for the market from the free and independent traveler are continuing to be strong. And then to address your question directly from the food and beverage perspective and the entertainment perspective, the consumers do seem to be purchasing those products in a strong way. So we\u2019re not concerned on that side. Susan Berliner : And then just turning to CapEx, I didn't see in the slides or in the press release CapEx at each entity. Can you go over that? And then, just discuss what, I guess, the major renovations are at CERP and CGP. Eric Hession : Sure. I can run through them here. So, at CERP, in the second quarter, we spent $32 million of capital, CGP was $21 million, CES was $2 million, and then CEOC was $38 million, for a total of $93 million. We did provide in the materials an updated range of CapEx, which you\u2019ll see was slightly higher on the bottom end, but we kept the top end of the range the same. The predominant projects that we have coming up in the second half of the year are room renovation projects. At CGP, we\u2019re embarking on a significant room renovation effort at Planet Hollywood. And at CERP, that's predominantly focused on room renovations at Paris right now. Susan Berliner : Great. And then I just want to try to figure out \u2013 I guess, with the CIE, congrats on that. Can you guys talk about what the proceeds will be used for? And then, if you can talk about if there are any other potential assets for sale such as Baltimore. Eric Hession : Due to the recency of the sale, we\u2019re not commenting at this point on the use of the proceeds. There was some disclosure around the payments that can be made for professional services, minority investors in the entity and a few other distributions. But other than that, we\u2019ll comment on that at a later date. And then with respect to additional asset sales, again, nothing to comment on there. We don't have, at this time, any plans to divest further assets. Susan Berliner : Great. Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. John DeCree : Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just wanted to go back quickly to some of the color you provided on the regional gaming customer. And I was wondering if you're seeing any change in the promotional environment with some of your competitors in the regions where perhaps the consumer is a little softer. Eric Hession : Yeah. I would say, at this point, consistent with what we\u2019ve been trying to undertake for the last six quarters really, we've been trying to rationalize our investment with respect to the various segments, particularly in Midwest regions, but also in Las Vegas to some degree. We really drive down to that particular segment level and try to titrate our marketing efforts to achieve the maximum results that we can. We have seen a moderating competitive dynamic in terms of reinvestment levels, but I would say that that\u2019s also been fairly consistent now for the last six months. So a little bit different than in 2015. So at this point, I would say that there really don't seem to be any strong trends from an increasing reinvestment perspective for many of the competitors that we see. And this is broadly speaking, of course, across the portfolio. John DeCree : Okay, very helpful. And to switch gears into Las Vegas, I think some, obviously, really good data points as it relates to the non-gaming business that are pretty consistent across the board. I was wondering if you can add a little more color to your views on the gaming business, the casino floor, if you\u2019re expecting any particular growth in that area or any improvements in terms of casino revenue growth in Las Vegas. Eric Hession : I\u2019d say, broadly speaking, in contrast to the non-gaming side where we are definitely seeing an increase in both the hotel demand, the food side and the entertainment side, the gaming side has been up a few percent for the past six months. We did have a strong second quarter with respect to baccarat business. But at this point, it's too early to tell whether that\u2019s going to continue. And as you know, that's certainly been a challenged segment for the prior five or six quarters before that. As Mark mentioned in his notes, we\u2019re actively searching for new product offerings that we can deliver to the floor. We do plan to roll out three test areas across our brand, with one of them being in Las Vegas that we believe will contain new products that will be very appealing to the millennial generation and will help really drive people in and reenergize the gaming side. John DeCree : Great. Thanks, Eric. Really appreciate the questions. Eric Hession : Sure, thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Brian Blackman : Right. Thank you very much. And I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon for our second quarter earnings announcement and we look forward to joining you again for the third quarter. Have a very good day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Brian Blackman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brian, the floor is yours. Brian Blackman : Thank you and good afternoon, and welcome to Caesars Entertainment Third Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, certain earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section on our Web-site at caesars.com. The slides are available for download and will accompany Mark and Eric's prepared remarks for those of you on the phone that would like to follow along. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of this afternoon's press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and will shortly file our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2016. Before we get underway, I would like to call your attention to certain statements and information on slides 1 through 4, which we incorporate by this reference. The forward-looking statement Safe Harbor disclaimers in our public documents cover this call and the simultaneous Webcast at caesars.com. This call, the Webcast, and its replay are the property of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It's not for rebroadcast or use by any other party without the prior written consent of Caesars Entertainment Corporation. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect now. By remaining on the line, you agree to be bound by these terms. Today's call will include discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, property EBITDA and certain supplemental financial information. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures, and the reasons management believe these measures provide useful information for investors can be found on Slide 3 and in the appendix to this presentation beginning on Slide 24. These non-GAAP measures are not preferable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in the presentation or discussed on this conference call. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners. Through the second quarter of 2016, we aggregated the operating segments within CGP into two separate reportable segments, CGP Casinos and Caesars Interactive Entertainment. Given the sale of CIE's social and mobile game business in the third quarter, which represented the majority of CIE's operations, CIE is no longer considered as separate reportable segment from CGP Casinos based on management's view. Therefore, CGP Casinos and CIE have been combined for all periods presented to form the CGP segment. CEC also has a majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, but CEC's financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15 of 2015. However, in addition to a review of CEC's reported financial information on this call, we will also discuss certain supplemental financial information regarding CEOC, including certain remarks that combine CEOC's results with those of CEC. CEC has committed to a material amount of payments to support CEOC's restructuring which would result in the reacquisition of CEOC's operations if the restructuring is made on terms consistent with the current restructuring support agreement to which CEC is a party. As a result, this non-GAAP supplemental financial information is presented as a benefit to the users to understand the results of the entire Caesars Enterprise, including CEOC, and consistent with the management service provided across all properties. The results are not indicative of future performance or the results post restructuring. As used during the call, the words, Company, Caesars, Caesars Entertainment, we, our, and us, refer to Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its consolidated entities unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise. As seen on today's agenda on Slide 5, we'll begin the call today with some remarks by Mark whose comments will generally relate to the entire Caesars Enterprise, including our deconsolidated subsidiary, CEOC. Eric will then review our financial results before Mark concludes with some closing comments, and we will then open up the call for your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark P. Frissora: Thank you, Brian. In the third quarter, we delivered year-over-year improvement in our financial performance as we continued to execute against our strategic and operational objectives. These performance improvements are a direct result of our ongoing investment in hospitality assets and our focus on continuous improvement. Turning to Slide 6, net revenues for CEC, which excludes CEOC and our recently sold social and mobile games business, increased 3% to $986 million. Net income increased $761 million to $5 million positively, mainly due to a gain on the sale of the SMG business which closed on September 23, offset by an additional accrual to support the restructuring of CEOC. As you may recall, Caesars Interactive announced in August that it had agreed to sell its SMG business for $4.4 billion in cash to a consortium of Chinese investors led by Shanghai Giant Network Technology. Adjusted EBITDA for CEC increased 9% to $269 million and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 158 basis points to 27.3%. At an Enterprise-wide level, which includes CEC, CEOC and our recently sold SMG business, adjusted EBITDA increased 1% to $638 million. Enterprise-wide performance was impacted by a significant unfavorable hold with an estimated year-over-year EBITDA impact between $30 million and $35 million. Hospitality revenues remained a key driver of performance with Enterprise-wide cash ADR increasing 9% year-over-year to an all-time high of $136 and strong growth in Las Vegas entertainment. Additionally, we continue to generate marketing and operational efficiencies which help mitigate inflationary wage pressures in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Hold adjusted revenue per employee grew 4.5% year-over-year in the quarter. These positive drivers were offset by unfavorable year-over-year hold, predominantly at Caesars Palace and Harrah's New Orleans as well as weaker gaming volume trends in the Southeastern United States. Since our last call, there has been significant progress towards an ultimate resolution in the CEOC bankruptcy proceedings. Last month, all of CEOC's major creditor groups signed amended restructuring support agreements and have agreed to the terms of the latest plan of reorganization. This is a key milestone in CEOC's efforts to implement a consensual restructuring and paves the way toward a successful conclusion of CEOC's bankruptcy in 2017. Once the restructuring is complete, management will be able to turn its full attention towards our strategic priorities, which we believe will continue to drive value to all of our stakeholders. As I have mentioned on previous calls and can be seen on Slide 7, our cornerstone initiatives are a critical component of our plan to expand margins and to grow cash flows through revenue and efficiency initiatives while driving employee engagement and customer satisfaction. Beginning on Slide 8, we continue to make progress enhancing our hospitality and loyalty programs with the goals of expanding our customer base and increasing customer engagement. We remain focused on growing adoption of Total Rewards App. The app allows us to engage directly and in real-time with customers before, during and after they visit our properties. As a result of our updated design and content, new user installations and user sessions have risen 55% and 62% respectively over Q3 of last year. In addition, we've had initial success is fostering a more direct relationship with our customers through Caesars.com. As a result of improvements to the mobile booking experience, we have seen greater traffic and bookings through our mobile Web-site and conversion, defined as the percentage of users that execute a successful transaction, is up 14% year-over-year through September. This has generated incremental hotel revenue as well as benefited our Total Rewards enrolment, which has increased 33% year-over-year through this channel. We've been recognized for our efforts on our loyalty program, recently winning two awards at this year's Mega Awards. The Mega Awards are one of the travel industry's highest accolades recognizing innovation in the airline and travel business. Caesars Entertainment won the Loyalty Innovation of the Year category for our ability to integrate the Total Rewards program with mobile technology. Our Total Rewards Visa Card also won Innovation of the Year in the Travel Co-Brand Card category. Turning to slides 9 through 11, investing in our infrastructure is another important cornerstone priority with a heavy focus on refreshing our hotel room product. During the quarter, we completed the previously announced renovation of the Augustus Tower at Caesars Palace and began to renovate a combined 3,400 room at Paris and Planet Hollywood. We are preparing to start the Palace Tower renovation at Caesars Palace currently scheduled to begin in the first quarter. This will bring our total renovated room product to over 10,000 rooms or approximately 44% of our Las Vegas portfolio since 2014. Continuing with our Las Vegas masterplan is a high-return opportunity for us with cash ADR increases ranging from $25 to $40 per room at our recently renovated hotel towers in the region. Similarly, we are taking steps to update our hotel product in regional markets. In September, we announced the renovation of the Bayview Tower at Harrah's Atlantic City, which are the most convenient set of rooms for guests visiting our Conference Center. This is the latest in a series of enhancements at the resort, including planned improvements to The Pool After Dark, the construction of the new fitness center and upgrades to our Food Court. The renovation will help us to maximize performance of the adjacent Waterfront Conference Center by enabling us to deliver a more competitive room product, which will translate into incremental cash ADR and banquet revenues. Complementing our room renovations, we are investing in our food, beverage and entertainment at Caesars Palace offerings to stimulate the incremental visitations to our properties. In Las Vegas, we've opened the Alto Bar at Caesars Palace replacing the Seahorse Lounge. Over at the LINQ Promenade, in addition to opening the Amorino Gelato and Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips, construction begins on several new tenants that will soon arrive to the complex, including In-N-Out Burger and Virgil\u2019s Real Barbecue, which are on track to open by year-end. Once these leased sites are opened, occupancy at the complex will increase to 91%. The High Roller has demonstrated improved performance as well with ridership up 18% in the third quarter due to enhanced marketing efforts by our dedicated team, focused on attracting traffic to the LINQ Promenade. On a regional basis, we are adding new offerings as well. We recently opened the Cross Street Grill at Harrah's Joliet and have plans to open Guy Fieri's Philly Kitchen & Bar at Harrah's Philadelphia, and The Blind Tiger at Harrah's Biloxi. On the entertainment front, our headliner business has proved to be successful in the expansion of our offerings to make Caesars the third largest live entertainment promoter in North America. The AXIS at Planet Hollywood and the Colosseum at Caesars Palace have been important drivers behind this achievement and have enabled us to deliver strong growth in entertainment revenues. Pollstar ranked The AXIS as the number one theater venue in United States based on 2016 year-to-date ticket sales through the third quarter and the Colosseum was ranked third on the same metric. The AXIS has held in a new era of entertainment in Las Vegas by bringing the first pop music residencies to the Strip, including Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. In March 2017, the best-selling boy band of all time, The Backstreet Boys, will be the latest artist to headline an exclusive residency of 26 shows at The AXIS and sales are already off to an extraordinary start. We are working to upgrade our entertainment amenities outside the Las Vegas as well. Last month, we announced several enhancements to Harrah's Philadelphia, including improvements to our existing gaming and entertainment area located at The Block. The space will offer customers a uniquely intimate concert experience as well as live table game action and a brand-new bar and lounge. We expect these renovations to be completed by the spring of next year. We also plan to add an exciting new entertainment venue at Harrah's New Orleans that I look forward to providing more details on in the future. I'd like now to turn the call and talk a little bit about our continuous improvement efforts on Slide 12. Our investments in technology are critical. They allow us to improve productivity and quality and better connect with our customers by delivering scalable personalized service. On the customer service side, we have expanded the rollout of self-service check-in kiosks to six hotels in Las Vegas and approximately 22% of our guests at those properties are now using this feature. Subject to any regulatory approvals, we are also migrating certain applications and data to the cloud to increase efficiency and agility. We continue to look for ways to optimize our marketing programs to increase visitation and productivity through all of our key customer contact channels. We plan to leverage technology to better meet the needs of our guests and improve the overall customer experience. We're also leveraging technology to enhance the sales and service culture within the organization, as shown on Slide 13. For example, the implementation of mobile technology on the slot board to manage customer transactions and streamline processes has resulted in better service for our gaming guests. Our slot attendant activity scheduling is prioritized automatically and communicated to them via a mobile device. The Mobile Slot Dispatch System, which has been deployed at 11 properties in Las Vegas and regional markets, has delivered a 15% to 20% improvement in response efficiency. We expect to introduce this technology to all properties by the second quarter of 2017. Our continued progress on our sales and service cornerstone is reflected in the fact that overall service scores improved year-over-year in the third quarter. Turning to Slide 14, gaming innovation is a long-term strategic focus. In September, we entered into two new agreements with Gamblit and GameCo which will make Caesars the first casino operator to offer skills-based real money gaming machines unlike anything seen on the casino floors today. Through our multiyear agreement with Gamblit, Caesars will roll out Gamblit's Model G and TriStation machines in our California and Nevada properties, beginning with Harrah's resorts in Southern California. Each machine contains multiple themes and cutting-edge skills-based games, including a Match 3 game and a word matching game. We plan to field trial games at our Nevada properties pending regulatory approval, after which we expect to deploy a large number of gaining seats across multiple properties in the state. We also reached an agreement with GameCo to debut their video game gambling machines at our Atlantic City properties. Following the receipt of a regulatory approval in October, Harrah's, Bally's and Caesars now feature a total of 21 gaming positions at GameCo's new offering Danger Arena. This first-person action game where players' skill determines the payout combines the fun and entertainment of video games, e-sports and gambling, all in one experience. We are proud to be the first to bring these innovative games to our customers and plan to make skill-based games an increasingly important part of our gaming environments. I will now ask Eric to provide a more detailed view of this quarter's results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll start with a review of CEC's consolidated results, followed by a review of the Company's reportable segments and supplemental information which will include CEOC's performance as well. Slide 16 summarizes CEC's results, which do not include CEOC as it is no longer consolidated. Additionally, the sale of CIE's social and mobile games business in the third quarter has caused that business to be classified as a discontinued operation. CIE's remaining business, which includes real money online gaming and the World Series of Poker, will be accounted for going forward in CEC and CGP's results. For the third quarter of 2016, CEC's net revenues increased 3% to $986 million, mainly due to strong growth in the Las Vegas region, which was partially offset by revenue declines in Atlantic City and New Orleans and unfavorable year-over-year hold. Net income, before including the effect of non-controlling interest, was $5 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $756 million in the third quarter of 2015. Earnings per share for CEC, which includes the effect of non-controlling interest, was a loss of $4.38 per share compared to a net loss of $5.44 per share in the year ago period. The non-controlling interest is primarily Caesars Acquisition Company's ownership in CGP. Year-over-year, net income and earnings per share improvements were driven by a $4.2 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of CIE's social and mobile games unit, partially offset by an accrual increase of approximately $3 billion related to the restructuring of CEOC. Due to these large charges, we believe it's beneficial to provide adjusted EBITDA figures as further insight into our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $269 million, with a margin increase of 158 basis points, mainly due to higher revenues and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a positive effect on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold, and an unfavorable effect of between $5 million and $10 million when compared to the prior year period. Turning to Slide 17 and the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, third quarter net revenues rose 5% year-over-year to $569 million due to strong growth in gaming and hospitality revenues in Nevada. While CERP experienced strength in Las Vegas due to higher hotel rates, there were over 32,000 room nights out of service during the quarter due to room renovations that had a negative effect. These room nights were primarily concentrated at the Paris Resort and Casino which began renovations in July and will continue through the remainder of 2016. Service net income increased $6 million year-over-year to $6 million and the net profit margin was 1.1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $170 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins up 91 basis points, mainly due to higher revenues and marketing and operational efficiencies. Hold was estimated to have a positive effect on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold, and between $0 and $5 million when compared to the prior year period. Slide 18 summarizes the performance of Caesars Growth Partners. Caesars Growth Partners net revenues were $422 million in the third quarter, up 1% year-over-year, mainly due to higher hotel rates and increases in entertainment revenues in Las Vegas. That was offset by an unfavorable year-over-year hold and lower food and beverage revenues due to decreases in the banquet business in Las Vegas. At Harrah's New Orleans, we look forward to opening our first outdoor smoking patio on December 1. We believe the patio will provide a more convenient alternative for our smoking guests and help alleviate the loss of slot revenues that we have experienced since the smoking ban went into effect. Net income before including the effect of non-controlling interest increased to $3.9 billion from $21 million in the year ago period, mainly due to the gain on sale of CIE's social and mobile games business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 2% year-over-year to $100 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin grew 25 basis points due to higher revenues and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated to have a minimal effect on operating income in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable $5 million to $10 million effect when comparing to the prior year period. Unfavorable hold was concentrated at Harrah's New Orleans due to exceptional hold in the same period last year. Slide 19 shows supplemental information on CEOC's third quarter performance. Net revenues were $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year as a result of unfavorable year-over-year hold, mainly at Caesars Palace, and lower gaming volumes in our Southeast region, partially offset by our higher hotel rates and improved food and beverage revenues in Nevada. Additionally, reimbursable revenues declined due to the removal of the Ohio properties and the expenses associated with these revenues declined similarly. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 12% to $276 million, and margins declined 190 basis points from the prior year period, mainly due to hold. Hold was estimated to have an unfavorable effect on the operating income of between $10 million and $15 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold, and between $25 million and $30 million when compared to the prior year period. Now let's take a look at additional non-GAAP supplemental information for the entire Enterprise for the third quarter on Slide 20, which include CEOC and the recently sold social and mobile games business. Caesars Enterprise-wide net revenues were down 1% to $2.1 billion, as higher revenues in Las Vegas were offset by revenue declines in our regional markets, unfavorable year-over-year hold and lower reimbursable expenses. Excluding reimbursable expenses, revenues would have been flat on a year-over-year basis. Caesars Enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA increased 1% year-over-year to $638 million due to the performance of CIE's social and mobile gaming business and marketing and operational efficiencies which offset lower revenues. Hold was estimated to have an unfavorable effect on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold, and between $30 million and $35 million when compared to the prior year period. Going forward, we expect the inflationary cost pressures, including salary and benefits, to persist into the fourth quarter and we remain diligent in managing these pressures through our continuous improvement initiatives. We also expect to be adversely affected by ongoing restructuring efforts, largely in the form of elevated expenses across many parts of our business. Lastly, ongoing room renovations across our hotel portfolio will result in inventory disruptions, particularly in the fourth quarter and into 2017, given the ramp-up of construction activities at Paris and the beginning of construction at Planet Hollywood and Harrah's Atlantic City, all of which we will attempt to mitigate. Slide 21 provides a summary of quarter-end liquidity and projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. The underlying performance of the Enterprise continues to strengthen, driven by our investments in the high-return low-risk areas such as room renovations and our more efficient operating model. This has resulted in greater cash flow generation than we had originally anticipated. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our cash flow through efficiencies and profitable growth investments to drive value for our stakeholders. I'll turn it back to Mark for some closing comments. Mark P. Frissora: Thank you, Eric. Please turn to Slide 23. In summary, Caesars delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter despite contending with significant unfavorable hold, inflationary pressures and gaming weakness in the Southeastern U.S. As we look to 2017, we are focused on executing against our cornerstone initiatives, prudently allocating our capital to high-return projects and laying the groundwork to continue our solid performance. Hospitality will remain a critical driver of revenue growth as additional renovated hotel inventory comes online. We're also optimistic of the introduction of new and exciting skills-based gaming products will appeal to new customers. Further, we are pleased about the progress that has been made in the CEOC restructuring. We are hopeful that this puts CEOC on a path to emerge from bankruptcy next year. We're looking forward to directing management's full attention towards executing our strategic priorities and creating value for our stakeholders. We will now open up the line for Q&A. We'd ask that you please keep your questions focused on business performance. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with J.P. Morgan. Susan Berliner : So you guys talked a lot about skill-based, and I was wondering, I know it's early, if you could give any color with regards to how those machines are doing versus what's on the existing floor, what kind of demographics of people have been seeking those out? Eric Hession : Unfortunately, you're right. We just put them on the floor I believe last week. So we don't have data to share at this point. So I think we'll have to wait until the next conference call. We're obviously very excited to trial the games in Atlantic City and get the responses from the customers, but at this point unfortunately it's just too early to give any feedback. Susan Berliner : Great. And is it too early also to discuss any change that you have seen with the new Borgata management, any increased promotions in AC markets? Eric Hession : Yes, a similar answer. We haven't heard of any significant changes at this point. But as you know, it has been fairly recent when they changed ownership structure. Susan Berliner : Great. And then just turning to the consumer, I was wondering if you could talk about trends you saw during the quarter and if you can give us any color on October with regards to spend, visitation or different buckets of customers? Eric Hession : From a database perspective, really the trends have been quite consistent for the last multiple quarters. We continue to see some slight increases in trips from our higher-end customers and our spend-per-trip across most categories continues to increase. Where we're seeing declines, it does tend to be in the lower-end segment, and that's on a trip basis, not necessarily on a spend-per-trip basis. So that's from the gaming side, which is largely consistent to what we've seen before. From the non-gaming side, which is particularly dominant here in Las Vegas, we continue to see relatively strong demand from the FIT, and overall, although it's somewhat lumpy, from the group customer the demand also continues to be reasonably strong. Susan Berliner : Great. My last question is, Eric, if you could give us CapEx by each entity for the quarter? Eric Hession : Sure. I'll just run through it and it's detailed in the Q that will be coming out shortly as well. For CERP, we spent $28 million, which makes our year-to-date $87 million. For CGP, it was $17 million and year-to-date would be $57 million. CES was $8 million in the quarter, which is $14 million year-to-date. And then at CEOC, it was $37 million, and that makes the total year-to-date $171 million. So the total for the quarter was $90 million and the total year-to-date was $329 million. As you saw in the materials, we did update our ranges slightly. The aggregate change for all the subsidiaries on a consolidated basis was to reduce the low end by $20 million and then the high end by $10 million. Again, I would think of that as basically timing. Some of our construction spending got pushed into 2017 that we had anticipated we would achieve in the late 2016 timeframe. Susan Berliner : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Farber with Credit Suisse. David Farber : I had a couple of questions. I wanted to first lead with Las Vegas. Obviously we see continued strength in the hotel and F&B side. I was curious how you feel you are positioned for 2017, any expectations you may have for Vegas in 2017? And then separately, maybe talk a little bit about how many rooms you think will be offline given all the developments you're doing on the Strip? And then I had a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Eric Hession : Sure. I'll try to answer it first. From a positioning standpoint, one of the objectives that we've had and what's part of our cornerstone initiatives is to really improve the asset quality of our hotel rooms and the underlying product that we are able to offer to the customers. As you have been following since late 2014, we have undertaken an initiative to try to renovate the majority of our Las Vegas rooms and we're making significant progress along those lines. What ultimately happens is that then the customers perceive our product as better, we are able to then get more efficient bookings that cost us less, we also get up-sells as we've mentioned from a revenue standpoint, and customers that stay in upgraded rooms also tend to spend more on the other activities. So it's a very virtuous position to be in. As we mentioned, we'll have about 10,000 of the rooms or 44% completed by the midpoint of next year. And so, that will significantly improve our position with respect to the market. And that's really from a Las Vegas standpoint where we think the biggest upside is from that non-gaming side. Regarding the room construction disruption, we mentioned this quarter we had about 32,000 rooms out of order. We'd anticipate throughout next year, although again it could be somewhat lumpy, but we would anticipate to have outages of that similar magnitude. Certainly in the fourth quarter we have a number of towers under renovation, including significant construction at Paris and Planet Hollywood. And then heading into next year, we also take out the Palace Tower here at Caesars Palace, which is slightly over 1,100 rooms. So that's a significant renovation. Those will all finish up next year, but there is going to be similar construction disruption as we head into next year. David Farber : That's helpful. And then on the mix side, any sort of expectations around Vegas in terms of either bookings, group bookings, RevPAR, any sort of thoughts around what you think 2017 may look like given what's on the calendar today? Eric Hession : Again, it's similar to how I answered Su's comment on the database makeup. The trends have been largely consistent. The FIT business has been relatively strong throughout the year. We don't see any reason why that would change. The group business, although it can be lumpy at times, has also been reasonably strong and we would expect 2017 to be a continuation of what we've achieved this year. So, from a mix standpoint, I wouldn't anticipate anything dramatically changing, just an improvement in our offerings which will enable us to be able to attract customers and charge higher rates on the ADR front. David Farber : Okay. And then just switching over to CEOC for the moment, the results were a touch weaker this quarter, although I guess the hold adjustment gets you guys effectively flattish it seems. So, I guess away from Vegas, I was curious to hear how you're thinking about the regional markets, what customer behavior may be like? Any thoughts there would be helpful, and then I had one last question. Thanks. Eric Hession : You're right, we had very unusual poor hold concentrated within CEOC, and you're right that adjusting for that makes it much more of a respectable performance for the quarter. The impact from the regional markets is really being hit down in the Louisiana-Mississippi region. There is definite weakness in the consumer. We believe it's centered around the oil and gas industry and it's kind of across the board in terms of our properties. We're taking actions to try to minimize that as I mentioned with some things we're doing in New Orleans, and Mark mentioned the potential entertainment activities that we're able to do down there. So, we are trying to offset it but there is weakness in that Louisiana-Mississippi region. Broadly speaking, the rest of the regional markets are similar to what we have seen throughout 2016, with some markets up a few percent, some markets down a few percent, but really I wouldn't call out any other abnormal trends. David Farber : Okay. And then just finally, there are a number of sort of new market growth opportunities, potentially in the near to mediate term. I guess I was just curious how you think Caesars is positioned either internationally or domestically, maybe a new topic with the exit, but I'd be curious to hear how you think about those growth opportunities and what, if any, particular market you might be focusing on? And that's it for me. Thanks. Mark P. Frissora: I think that as you look at the opportunity going forward, what we've modelled anyway, is based on the agreements actually getting approved by the Bankruptcy Court, which would be in January. We'll have a very strong balance sheet, one of the strongest balance sheets of all public companies. Leverage will be a little bit lower than what most of the public companies are at right now, probably a turn lower on debt-to-EBITDA. And so, we'll take advantage of that. We'll have an opportunity to look at certain markets that I would call destination markets where we know that if we invest some capital, we get a reasonable return on it. So, if it's for example a hotel product, there's an opportunity to get cash business on it. And then if we're like number three or number four in the market, we think there may be an opportunity to get synergies by buying smaller players not doing well, someone who we could for example bring Total Rewards in and get a lift. And we're seeing obviously anywhere we go with Total Rewards, we bring in a usual lift in the property. So, we think there will be development opportunities once we get out of bankruptcy. We haven't been able to pursue those obviously for the last couple of years, but given our regional presence, we think there is opportunity in some of those regional markets from a \u2013 what you would call destination markets. So, that could be New Orleans, Lake Tahoe, Atlantic City to a lesser extent, but there are markets that we think we could develop even better. We also know that globally there is a lot of development projects that we certainly have our row in the water but nothing has come to fruition. But you certainly heard MGM talk about those today. We are certainly \u2013 we are in the mix on all those and we'll make sure that we pursue those and there will be lots of growth opportunities globally going forward the next couple of years. The last thing I'll just mention is that we also \u2013 when we look at the room product in Vegas, we think that can provide really good earnings momentum as we come out of bankruptcy because we were a little undercapitalized and we hadn't kept current with our room product, and everyone else on the Strip had. That allows really nice flow-through. When we do a room refurb, we get typically a 30% to 35% ROIC on that, and that's very high and it's very low-risk project and it provides really good flow-through on the $25 to $40 a room night that we get. The cost is there already, it's a fixed cost to service the room, and we just get very high flow-through from it. So, we think that will provide really good earnings momentum going forward with the company. David Farber : Very good. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. John DeCree : Mark, just wanted to stay on the topic that you just brought up there, I was wondering if on the room renovations, the cash ADR premium you see, if it's relatively instant in terms of price directing on your side or if there's a little bit of a ramp once some of your customers get a chance to see the new rooms, and just curious if there's a little bit of a ramp-up period once those rooms come online? Mark P. Frissora: Not really. I'll let Eric respond on this too, but I mean in general it's fairly quick. I would say, within 90 days or less we were seeing an instant lift. We typically do some pre-promotion on it. So it's not like we introduce the room product in the market and then just expect everyone to know about it. I mean we do launch some PR, some online, some social media to make sure people understand the rooms are new and they can be booking them. And we open up big quadrums of them, if you will. It's not just, like if we get one onboard, we'll go ahead and announce one, we'll announce a whole tower. For example, Caesars Palace, and we did that for example on Augustus, and we were talking about it and we did \u2013 we just announced recently the opening of Julius, and we got very quick lift on it. So, again, we've done 10,000 rooms of the 24,000 rooms we have on the Strip. We expect to complete the rest of them over the next couple of years. And we've had obviously interruption in our numbers this year and we'll have that next year, but we're still overcoming that being able to get a nice profit improvement from it. John DeCree : Got it. Thank you. And one question, sorry if I missed it, Eric, in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned some inflationary cost pressures, wasn't sure if that was just general inflation or elevated costs from some of the reinvestment projects that you guys are doing, if you could just give me a little bit of color on that? Eric Hession : Sure. I did mention it in the specific remarks, but it's general inflation. However, it's somewhat exacerbated by some particular increases that we've had in the salaries, wages and benefits area associated with large portions of our workforce. And then the rest of the increases would be general inflation associated with just normal commodities. John DeCree : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Brian Blackman : Thank you, operator. And that concludes our third quarter call and we look forward to reporting fourth quarter and full-year results after the beginning of next year. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you for joining us. This does conclude our call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

These non-GAAP measures are not preferable to GAAP results provided elsewhere in the presentation or discussed on this conference call. As a reminder, Caesars Entertainment Corporation is a holding company with the following consolidated entities, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties and Caesars Growth Partners. CEC also has a majority ownership of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, but CEC's financial results do not include the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries following its Chapter 11 filing on January 15 of 2015. However, in addition to a review of CEC's reported financial information on this call, we will also discuss certain supplemental financial information regarding CEOC, including certain remarks that combine CEOC's results with those of CEC. CEC has committed to a material amount of payments to support CEOC's restructuring which would result in the reacquisition of CEOC's operations if the restructuring is made in terms consistent with the current restructuring support agreement to which CEC is a party. As a result, this non-GAAP supplemental financial information is presented as a benefit for users to understand the results of the entire Caesars Enterprise, including CEOC, and consistent with the management services provided across all properties. These results are not indicative of future performance or the results post restructuring.

As seen on today's agenda on Slide 6, we'll begin the call today with some remarks by Mark whose comments will generally relate to the entire Caesars Enterprise, including our deconsolidated subsidiary, CEOC. Eric will then review our financial results before Mark concludes with some closing comments, and we will then open up the call for your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Brian. I'm pleased to report that Caesars capped another strong year with solid operating performance in the fourth quarter, driven by revenue growth in Las Vegas and margin expansion across the enterprise. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results reflect the successful execution of our strategic initiatives, particularly our ongoing investments in hospitality and focus on operational efficiency. As shown on Slide 7, at the continuing CEC, which excludes CEOC and the recently sold social mobile games business, full-year net revenues increased 3% to $3.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $1.1 billion. Net loss was $2.7 billion due to accruals related to the CEOC restructuring offset by a gain from the sale of CIE social and mobile games business. Eric will cover these performance metrics in more detail later in the call. On an enterprise-wide basis, which add CEOC to continuing CEC, full-year net revenues increased 1% to $8.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 6% to $2.2 billion. Net revenue was driven by strong growth in Las Vegas hospitality revenues, a one-time management termination fee at CEOC and favorable hold in Las Vegas, which offset regional gaming weakness. As I mentioned earlier, we benefited from the investments we have made in our hospitality offerings, including the recapitalization of our hotel product in Las Vegas and strong performance of our entertainment business. Cash hotel revenue was up 9% year-over-year establishing a new high since 2007. Additionally, we generated record level of marketing efficiency due to higher email conversion from direct mail and refined segmentation. Labor productivity also improved with full-time employees down 4% for the year driven by planned attrition. All combined has led to a 117 basis point increase in EBITDA margins year-over-year, our second consecutive year of enterprise-wide margin growth. Our focus has been steadfast on maintaining market share and operating the business efficiently while preserving high levels of employee engagement and customer satisfaction. I'm pleased to report that we were successful in each of these efforts in 2016. Our employees reported the highest level of satisfaction since 2005 in our annual Employee Opinion Survey and the biggest year-over-year improvement in at least 10 years. On the customer side, we enhanced the guest experience with our overall service score up 4% over last year. Our performance in 2016 is a testament to the execution of our strategies and the success of the investments we have made in our people, our products, our services and our capabilities. Notably, we've achieved this level of success with the background noise of the CEOC bankruptcy. As you know the Bankruptcy Court confirm CEOC\u2019s plan of reorganization last month. We are now focused on securing approval from regulators for the plan, raising certain emergence financing and completing the merger between Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition Company. We are optimistic that all the steps will be completed and CEOC will emerge late this summer. Moving back to our strategic objectives, we have made substantial progress in the cornerstone initiatives they introduced last year, which are listed on Slide 8. These four initiatives have played a critical role in expanding margins and growing cash flows over the past four quarters and the senior management team and I have recommitted to these cornerstones again in 2017. Let me review some highlights of our progress during 2016. Turning to Slide 9, we've been taking actions to enhance our hospitality and loyalty programs including total rewards with the intention of expanding our customer base and deepening our customer relationships. We made headway on this initiative in 2016 including improving our active customer email capture rates up to 89% now, increasing the active database of $400 plus customer segments by 5% year-over-year, growing caesars.com, generated revenues by 12% year-over-year, increasing downloads of our Play By Total Rewards app by 81% and winning various awards for hospitality and loyalty programs including more than 60 of the best of Las Vegas awards. Over the course of the last year, we have set out to foster more direct relationship with our customers. To this end, we have invested in enhancing the customer experience on caesars.com and to our mobile app. The Play By Total Rewards app is at the core of our strategy to engage customers and give them what they want, when they want it. The increasing number of app users provides an opportunity to grow revenue, as we deploy additional functionality this year including bubble payment and a new offer experience. As shown on Slide 10 to 12, one of the main drivers of our 2016 performance has been the investment in our hospitality offerings, particularly the recapitalization of our hotel product in Las Vegas. During the fourth quarter, we completed the renovation of approximately 1,100 rooms at Paris and continued renovations of roughly 2,200 rooms at Planet Hollywood. Additionally, we began the renovation of approximately 1,100 Palace Tower rooms at Caesars Palace in the first quarter of 2017. Once completed, we will have renovated almost half of our Las Vegas room inventory since 2014. Despite recent investment in Las Vegas market, our room product is still under capitalized relative to Pier properties providing additional upside opportunity. Importantly, renovated rooms continue to perform well yielding an incremental $25 to $40 lift in cash ADR per room with strong flow through to EBITDA. Enterprise-wide Las Vegas cash ADR was up 7% in 2016 aided by greater pricing power in the Las Vegas market, as well as our investment in hotel product. Given the low risk high return nature of these projects, we will continue to pursue our capital plans to drive future revenue and EBITDA growth. In 2017, we plan to renovate over 7,000 rooms across the enterprise with a high proportion concentrated in Las Vegas. We have also selectively upgraded the hotel assets in regional markets over the course of the past year. We plan to continue these investments over time. As I noted on our last call, the renovation of Bayview Tower at Harrah's Atlantic City is currently underway and we recently announced the renovation of 500 rooms at Horseshoe Southern Indiana. We are also excited that the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Tribal Council has approved the addition of a fourth hotel tower at Harrah's Cherokee Casino as well as other amenities including approximately 100,000 square feet of convention meeting space. These enhancements will substantially increase the resorts total convention meeting and hotel room inventory solidifying Harrah's Cherokee as the largest hotel resort in North Carolina. We also have made a concerted effort to upgrade our food and beverage offerings across the network to stimulate greater traffic to our properties. For example, in addition to extending our partnerships with celebrity chefs Gordon Ramsay, Guy Savoy, and Guy Fieri to introduce new offerings in Las Vegas. We also opened well known concepts the LINQ Promenade such as Virgil\u2019s Real Barbecue in the fourth quarter and the highly anticipated In-N-Out Burger which debuted last month. Outside of Las Vegas, we opened a Craft Beer Berry at Harrah's Southern California, a sports bar at Harrah's North Kansas City and a food bar at Horseshoe Hammond to name a few. We will continue to evaluate and adapt our food and beverage portfolio to ensure our offerings remain appealing to a variety of demographics. Within entertainment, this vertical continues to be a source of strength for the Company and a positive contributor to our financial performance. We generated the highest entertainment operating income in the history of our Company in 2016 driven by the strongest portfolio of Live Entertainment in Las Vegas. We also received a number of industry accolades including being ranked by Billboard is the third largest promoter worldwide of Live Entertainment based on gross revenue after Live Nation and AEG Live, each of which co-promotes several of our shows. These achievements are attributable to two factors. First, the expansion of our Roster of Las Vegas headliners which is reaching an even broader range of customer demographics to drive consumers to our marquee properties. And second, strategic adjustments to the way we operate this business compared to a few years ago. Caesars was the first casino operator to launch the Residency Concept in Las Vegas 14 years ago with Celine Dion and today we have the most diversified portfolio of Resident Entertainers in the world. New residency such as Jennifer Lopez have not only drawn record ticket prices and crowds, but it also enhanced our brand equity. Due to the strong demand we've added 15 additional performances in 2017 for Jennifer Lopez\u2019s residency and extended dates for the Reba, Brooks & Dunn residency at The Colosseum through the end of 2017. We are also excited about the launch of the Backstreet Boys residencies at Planet Hollywood next month and the return of Pitbull\u2019s residency later this summer. Apart from the resident entertainers, we are exploring in the innovative ways to evolve our entertainment experiences and create unique spaces to attract and engage a broader audience. For example, capitalizing on the popularity of eSports, the Champions of Fire Invitational was held at Paris in November. The Amazon sponsored event brought together 16 of the world's biggest celebrity videogame streamers to battle it out across five popular casual mobile games for their share of the $100,000 cash prize drawing 3 million people to stream the event online. We continue to experiment with new offerings such as virtual reality and interactive games. Turning to our continuous improvement in operating model on Slide 13. As I noted earlier our focus on business process improvement has resulted in greater marketing and operational efficiencies across the enterprise. As a result we delivered a 5% improvement in the productivity of our workforce as measured by net revenue per full-time employee. A variety of initiatives have contributed to this outcome including the ongoing optimization of our marketing reinvestment, the rollout of technology enhancements to modernize the customer experience and modifications to our procurement process. We are also revitalize our lean efficiency program, developing 25 Black Belts and 25 Green Belts last year. We have plans to continue to expand the program. We will continue to look for opportunities to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our day-to-day operations. We expect the enhancements of certain of our IT and operational systems in 2017 to provide added benefits on this front. Moving to Slide 14. During the year we made progress in fostering a sales and service culture within the organization to enrich the guest experience. As part of this process we\u2019ve invested in the training and development of our employees and we have certified approximately 41,000 guest facing staff in our proprietary sales and service program. We are leveraging new tools and technologies deliver more efficient service and enhanced personalized interactions. In addition to realizing a positive shift in our 2016 net promoter score, our sales training initiatives are also generated incremental revenues with non-gaming revenue per full-time employee reaching an all-time high for 2016.We are encouraged by the outcomes we seen so far and believe we can continue to realize benefits to revenue as training is fully implemented across the company. Now let me turn it over to Eric to review our fourth quarter financial results and greater detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll start with a review of CEC's consolidated results, followed by a review of the Company's reportable segments and supplemental information which will include CEOC's performance as well. Slide 16 summarizes CEC's results, which do not include CEOC as it is no longer consolidated and also does not include the social mobile games business as it was sold in September of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, CEC's net revenues increased 3% to $949 million, mainly due to strong growth in the Las Vegas region, resulting from favorable year-over-year hold and improved hotel performance as a result of the renovations and strong Las Vegas market fundamentals. Net loss was $435 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $39 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Net loss per share for CEC was $3.68 compared to the net loss of $0.54 per share in the year ago period. Year-over-year declines a net income and earnings per share were driven by a $426 million accrual related to the restructuring of CEOC. Due to these large charge, we believe it's beneficial to provide adjusted EBITDA figures for additional visibility into our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $250 million, with a margin increase of 180 basis points mainly due to higher gaming and hotel revenues and continued focus on operational efficiency such as labor and marketing. Hold was estimated to have a minimal effect on operating income in the quarter relative to our expected hold, and a favorable effect of between $10 million and $15 million when compared to the prior year period. Turning to Slide 17 and the performance of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, fourth quarter net revenues rose 4% year-over-year to $536 million due to favorable year-over-year hold, primarily at Paris increased gaming volumes in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and improved hotel performance in Las Vegas as a result of the continued investment at Harrah's and Paris. Additionally, The LINQ promenade delivered improved results by increased wheel ridership and higher rental income due to growth in the tenant base. Hospitality of revenues at Paris were negatively impacted by room renovations of the property - over 23,000 room nights out of service in the quarter. As Mark noted earlier, Paris room renovations were completed in this summer. Service net income increased $12 million year-over-year to a net loss of $1 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-over-year to $163 million with adjusted EBITDA margins up 236 basis points mainly due to higher revenues and efficiency initiatives. Hold was estimated have a minimal effect on operating income in the quarter relative to our expected hold and a favorable factor between $5 million and $10 million when compared to the prior year period. Slide 18 summarizes the performance of Caesars Growth Partners. Caesars Growth Partners fourth quarter net revenues increased 3% year-over-year to $414 million primarily due to favorable year-over-year hold, improved hotel performance in Las Vegas, and increases in entertainment revenue mainly due to the Axis Theater at Planet Hollywood. This was offset by weaker gaming volumes in Baltimore and New Orleans, and lower food and beverage revenues, partially driven by the 33,000 room nights off the market at Planet Hollywood during the quarter due to renovations, which also affected that properties hotel revenues that - in Baltimore, gaming volumes were impacted by the entry of a new competitor into the market. Additionally in New Orleans, we continue to experience pressure from the smoking ban in a weak regional economy. So the opening of the first outdoor smoking patio on December 1 has begun to mitigate some of this impact. The improved stopping flexibility in New Orleans has also provided a positive impact on our cost structure which should help margins of the property moving forward. CGP net income decreased $14 million year-over-year to $11 million primarily attributable to the sale CIE social mobile games business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% year-over-year to $93 million and adjusted EBITDA margins grew 306 basis points due to higher revenues, efficiency initiatives and some favorable one-time year-over-year cost impacts. Hold was estimated to have a favorable effect on operating income of between zero to $5 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and also when compared to the prior year period. Slide 19, shows supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s fourth quarter performance. Net revenues increased 6% year-over-year to $1.2 billion revenue growth was attributable to the receipt of a one-time management contract terminations fee related to the divestiture of the three Ohio casinos, as well as favorable year-over-year hold and improved hotel performance both of which were driven primarily by Caesars towers. The completed renovations of the Octavius and Julius towers at Caesars Palace earlier in the year contributed to the favorable outcome. These positive drivers were partially offset by regional gaming related weakness, mainly concentrated in the Southeast and Midwest. Philadelphia also experienced pressure due to the casino for expansion of a competitor in the market. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $279 million, and margins increased 146 basis points from the prior year period mainly due to the continued focus on operational efficiencies. Hold was estimated to have favorable effect on operating income of between $15 million and $20 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and between $10 million and $15 million when compared to the prior year period. Now let\u2019s take a look at additional supplemental information for the entire enterprise for the fourth quarter on Slide 20, which includes CEOC. Caesars enterprise wide net revenues were up 5% to $2.1 billion. As mentioned earlier, the increase was primarily driven by the receipt of a one-time payment at CEOC, strengthen Las Vegas hospitality revenues and favorable year-over-year hold. These positive drivers were partially offset by revenue declines in the regional markets and lower reimbursable expenses. Caesars enterprise wide adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to $528 million, and margins expanded 176 basis points, primarily due to higher revenues and operational efficiencies. Hold an enterprise wide basis was estimated to have a favorable effect on operating income of between $15 million and $20 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold in between $20 million and $25 million when compared to the prior year period. Offsetting these hold improvements was disruption related to room renovations, and two power outages, we experienced here in Las Vegas. Going forward, we expect inflationary cost pressures including salary and benefits to persist and we will remain diligent in managing these pressures through our continuous improvement initiatives. We also expect ongoing room renovations across our hotel portfolio will result in greater inventory disruptions this year, when compared to the prior year given the ramp up of several construction projects. Additionally, we will continue to monitor the performance of Horseshoe Baltimore as the market absorbs a new competitor. Slide 21 provides a summary of quarter and liquidity, and 2017 projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. Our investments in high return low risk areas such as room renovations coupled with a more efficient operating model has resulted in a strong cash flow generation in 2016. Going forward, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our cash flow by focusing on our cost structure. We\u2019re also opening up to ourselves to profitable growth investments to drive value for our stakeholders. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark, for his closing remarks. Mark Frissora : Thanks, Eric. Please turn to Slide 23. In closing, 2016 represented another year of strong results for Caesars. Our full-year performance reflected the execution of our strategic objectives, including investment in our hospitality assets and operational improvements, which enabled us to sustain strong margin expansion. As we enter a New Year, Caesars remains poised for growth as we further build out our success achieved through our four cornerstone initiatives. We believed continued execution on the cornerstones will enable us to drive ongoing improvements in margins and cash flows to both revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, while simultaneously driving higher levels of employee engagement and customer satisfaction. Additionally, the conclusion of CEOC\u2019s restructuring and the merger with Caesars Acquisition will be a pivotal inflection point for the Company, while we have delivered strong operating performance within our existing footprint over the last two years, there is no question that CEOC\u2019s bankruptcy process has constrained us particularly when it comes to expansion. I am excited about the opportunities ahead of us to invest and expand our business more freely including the increasing distribution through Greenfield Development and M&A as we put the bankruptcy behind us in order to create value for all of our stakeholders. Going forward, further increasing cash flow will be a key objective of our financial performance. As a result, cash flow metrics will be more prominent in our presentation of financial results. We will now open up the line for Q&A. We would ask that you please keep your questions focused on business performance. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Farber from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Farber : Good afternoon, guys. How are you? Mark Frissora : Hi, good. Eric Hession : Hi, David. David Farber : Good. I had a number of questions. I guess first, you mentioned that in the prepared remarks, which is why I wanted to ask. But I guess given the recent confirmation and raising funds and emerging, I was hoping maybe you could just help us think through when a potential exit for CEOC would take place and maybe to the extent that you would be willing to talk about it, any incremental thoughts on the capital structures of server growth, just given the really strong performance there would be helpful, and then I have a number of follow-ups. Thanks. Eric Hession : Sure. David why don\u2019t I take a first part of it and Mark can jump in if he has anything there at the end. So as we mentioned, we're not providing any specific timeline for emergence, but we have outlined with three primary tasks that need to be completed. There are other smaller ones, but speaking at a high level, we need to complete the regulatory approval process, which requires certain approvals in variety of jurisdictions that we operate in. That process is underway and moving forward. We also have to complete the merger of CACQ and CZR, that process is also underway. And then finally, we need to complete the financing associated with the CMBS structure on the PropCo side and then the OpCo financing. That's also underway. In terms of providing specific guidance each three of those activities have certain steps and requirements and we're not providing direction at this point. However, as we said we anticipate that this summer we would hope that all three would be completed and we'd be able to emerge from bankruptcy. Regarding your second question on the rest of the capital structure. Yes, we've had great performance over the last two years at both CERP and CGP given the performance of those entities, the cash flow generation that we made and the increased EBITDA, the leverage of those facilities has come down. The current market dynamics, I think would indicate that it would be respectable to refinancing those facilities and should the market performance sustain and our performance sustain and we look to refinance those at some point in the future and take advantage of the lower interest rates to improve our cash flow. David Farber : Okay. That's very good. Just on the operation side, you described I think cash hotel rates were up 9% or so. I\u2019m curious to hear you're seeing the discount between the rooms and the market abate at all and then how much further you think you can drive ADR in Las Vegas? And then I had two others and that\u2019s it. Thanks. Eric Hession : Yes, we continued David. As you seen to outpace the market, we believe that\u2019s due to a number of different factors predominantly as you called out the improvement of our asset in terms of the quality through the room renovations relative to our competitors. We still believe there is signification gap between our competitors from an equal let\u2019s a peer brand perspective and where our properties are focused. When we look at online customer feedback from online travel sites are property still score lower than do applicable peer competitors and we believe a large driver of that is due to the quality of the product and as we improve that quality not only are we able to increase our price, but we're also able to attract that customer direct book with us, which is you know the cheaper way to effect the booking. So we're still optimistic that there's room in that segment. Mark Frissora : Yes, now just to add that now we understand index and we look at it every week on where we're under indexed and why but we also aren't completed with renovation projects we announced in this call there will around 7,000 rooms which is more than last year and there's probably a couple more years of those type projects those kinds of numbers ahead of us in order for us to get our product aftermarket parity. So we feel good that - we were good at this it's a very low risk kind of investment when you refer to room and you get immediate profit the moment you open it up and keep it out of service from anywhere from three months to four months and then you get a nice lesson very high ROI. So we think we've got a lot of runway yet to work this. David Farber : Very good. And then on the margin side they obviously continue to improve you briefly mentions some one-time benefit. So maybe you could just talk about what they were if how you expect margins to evolve this year. And then just on a housekeeping question, but in the deck you highlighted this onetime fee related to Ohio. So Eric I was curious with treatment of that was - if it\u2019s all EBITDA revenue and how we should think about that in terms of same-store. So two questions there and that\u2019s it for me? Eric Hession : Okay. Sure. So from a margin standpoint we did have a few favorable items in the fourth quarter and particular we had some corrections associated with our bad debt that and then we also had a favorable true up from our medical cruel as you know we have a program in place where we try to balance the employees medical benefits and programs where employees get three months throughout the year and that\u2019s reduced our inflation expectations associated with the cost of medical care. So it\u2019s a great program before the employees and from a financial standpoint it has to with managing the medical care. So that\u2019s being reflected in these results. Going forward, as I mentioned there are some cost pressures but we have initiatives in place to offset those we\u2019re very aggressive with our business process improvement. Mark mentioned we now have 50 Green or Black belts trained each property has these individuals deployed towards continuing to drive improvements at the property level and then macro level we undertake corporate initiatives to introduce technology across the enterprise that all further help offset this inflationary pressure. So we feel that there is still margin improvements to go and plan to deliver that during 2017. Mark Frissora : We also have a lot of headwinds in the board quarter and I want to make sure pull those out and talk about as well. The construction disruption was probably at least $5 million for us in the quarters. So that was a headwind with offset in addition of that we had issues again with power outages which are actually very costly during wrong time a year. I had a couple of just shut down the entire place, entire casino. Those were millions of dollars as well. So there were number of regional issues that I think we are more or less related to the economy of those by all post-regions and of course the smoking ban continues we thin have some kind of impact to one of our best properties which is in the Orleans. Those things are all [indiscernible] come in the quarter. Eric Hession : Yes, absolutely Mark. And then to finalize an on your second question related to Ohio. From an accounting perspective we brought the $83.5 million that we received as revenue. However because it's one time nature we excluded from adjusted EBITDA. So what you will see is that had a negative impact of about 100 basis point on our consolidate margin. Because obviously the denominator are higher and the [indiscernible] and was reflected as a positive contribution to operating income as that the appropriate gap trained. David Farber : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Payne from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Payne : Hi, great. Thank you. I mean one for Eric and a couple for Mark, but starting with Eric. Just a follow-up from the last question, I'm wondering and I can appreciate the complexity of what has to happen over the next few months, but as far as the existing capital structure goes, do you need to wait until the CEOC emergence for bankruptcy before you can consider being opportunistic with the current capital structure? Eric Hession : So yes, I mentioned there are some opportunities. At this point, we're not ready to commit one way or the other. We will have to evaluate market conditions. We\u2019ll evaluate the timing and will also evaluate what the optimum capital structure is in a post-merger world. What we also have to keep in mind is that we don't want to take action to quickly end up with a capital structure that isn't optimal from a long-term perspective. So we have to balance all those needs. But rest assured we're looking at all aspects of the capital structure and trying to optimize the future, so that we end up with the lowest cost of capital possible from a debt perspective. Michael Payne : Okay, fair enough, and then maybe for Mark. You talked about the ability for expansion post emergence. I'm wondering if you can give us an update on where you are with the Korean investment, maybe the longer term opportunity in Japan for you guys, and I guess anything else domestically that you can think of. Mark Frissora : The project that we have in Incheon Korea is still alive and well, and we replaced this last year with a new partner that was a great switching partnerships and they've been very helpful for us and continuing to move the ball down the road. So we continue to move towards an execution facility, architectural drawings are done and we\u2019re like I said moving forward on the timeline is given by the government. In terms of Japan, I was in Washington and had a chance to see Prime Minister Abe and of course talked about Caesars interest in Japan. We've been working on Japan for 10 years. So we've been in the hunt. We think we've got a very good position there because we have the opportunity actually be the only one represented that's not in Macau and as you know the Japanese and Chinese sometimes look to our advantage, given the relationships of the two countries. And Japan, we believe things were actually in a good place as a resolve that. Toronto is something that we are talking about right now, but that's something that we're certainly involved in and - but all these projects are as you know if you get into them a very confidential so, but we are working on number of development projects around the world and we're excited with the emergence bankruptcy to be able to do that in a way that's a little bit less bureaucratic and what we had to do before, which is kind of work with each entity in order to get anything approved and we have a lot of things back, but it will be nice to get out and be able to openly talk about lot of these projects and be able to fund them in the future. Michael Payne : Great, and then maybe for either of you, any notable strength or weakness for that matter that you're seeing regionally so far in 2017 and noticed AC numbers out, which kind of caught my eye, so anything there would be helpful? Mark Frissora : Well, we think that the month of January is a heavy - it\u2019s heavily influenced by calendarization, New Year's for example the all the right way, there are weekend days and weekdays that are affected. So it\u2019s heavy month in terms of calendarization. There is regional weakness that you can see the numbers that are coming out. So we see the same thing in terms of March, we think that will be very good in Vegas because it\u2019s an incremental conventions year-over-year that will play well. So overall for the quarter, I\u2019d saw we\u2019re comfortable, we\u2019re balanced. We feel good about where we are, but there have been numbers that have come out in the industry, which shows some weakness, but I think most of that is calendarization. Eric, you want to add to that? Eric Hession : Yes, I think that\u2019s right Mark. The takeaway I would say is that there really hasn\u2019t been a shift from the trends that we've observed the regional markets haven't been all that robust and in certain instances, there are definitely pockets of weakness due to regional economic considerations, and Vegas has been quite strong particular in the hotel side, all last year and we really don't see any reason to believe that that's going to change from a hotel demand perspective throughout 2017. Michael Payne : Okay, great. Thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chad Beynon : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, I wanted to touch on the CapEx that was in your slide deck on Slide 21. Pretty wide range in CERP and CGP. Mark you just mentioned the time it takes to renovate some of these properties in Las Vegas, so I'm guessing it's alluding to that, but could you help us think about, I guess firstly, the range of the CapEx there and then secondly if that's mostly in Las Vegas and pertaining to the 7,000 rooms and then maybe some timing on the beginnings of those rooms, I'm guessing that's after the big conventions in March? Eric Hession : Sure. Chad, you are right that the large swings in CapEx and why we provide a sizable ranges due to the timing associated with these major projects. As you are aware the spending curves associated with them are oftentimes difficult to project plus we will sometimes have delays caused either by identification of some construction aspect that we need to take more time to figure out or timing associated with something that we didn't anticipate. So we try to build in a range to account for this and you saw some of that in 2016 where our certain projects would flow over into 2017 either more or less than we had anticipated. As Mark mentioned, we have significant renovation underway at Planet Hollywood, Caesars Palace here and we're gearing up to start in the middle of the year another Hotel Tower at Harrah's Las Vegas. That was very successful last year in terms of the renovation. We have hotel renovations currently underway at Harrah's Atlantic City and in Southern Indiana. Planet Hollywood, the renovation started last year in September and we're continuing right through to June and when we're completed with that it will be a total of 2,200twenty rooms and that will be fully renovated for the whole property. So we feel very good about that property. Caesars will be in great shape and then Harrah's will also have two of its three towers completely renovated. The areas where we\u2019ll then start to turn the focus would be Flamingo. We do plan to start some room renovations there later in the year. We're also contemplating a Bally's tower renovation on the large tower at Bally's and those will be the next areas that we focus as we move through 2017. Chad Beynon : Okay. Very helpful. My follow-up on just operating efficiencies you mentioned a few KPIs, FTE is down 4% in the year and you've seen some margin improvement. Is there anything in 2017 that you plan on doing or that we should expect from the labor and marketing side that is not already in place either in Las Vegas or in the regional markets to help improve margins? Mark Frissora : I think that we\u2019re more of the same kind of in terms of our progress and marketing efficiency and operational efficiency. As it relates to revenue growth, we have a number of customer entanglement initiatives where we have figured out ways with our data analytic team to figure out how to engage existing customers more fully than we do. And the customers in our business model have a tendency to float around a lot. They're not as low as you like them to be and being able to entangle your existing customers get a higher share of wallet can be meaningful. And so we have a number of initiatives in our tied to machine learning that we're doing, something that\u2019s core here at this Company when the best in class total rewards program, customer relationship management programs and we're using that sophistication to again, get more customer involvement in the former revenue. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John DeCree : Good afternoon, everyone. Appreciate all the color. Just had two quick follow-up questions on Las Vegas. I was wondering if you could dive a little deeper into the operations and get your thoughts on where you're seeing the most strength in your business in Las Vegas, whether it would be kind of the leisure segment or the group segment especially as you guys have renovated and reinvestment in bunch of your rooms. Are you seeing the one segment starting to outperform the other? Mark Frissora : Yes. As we said earlier I would say that trends are generally consistent with what we've seen certainly having the renovated rooms does appeal to the leisure segment, but it also helps us with our bookings. So when we're trying to book a convention they like to be able to observe the room quality and be able to see that we have a fresh offering. The convention business is a bit more volatile will have certain peaks and values for example as Mark referenced in March there's a huge convention coming that comes every three years that are certainly provided boost to the city. We see the convention business remaining strong as leisure business. On the casino side also room renovations that we've seen have appealed well to those customers that come a few times a year and stay with us that we're getting great responses that a number of the properties and so when with us they tend to play more if they're staying in a higher quality room. So that helps as well. John DeCree : Got it. And then just to shift gears to the non-gaming segment in Las Vegas talked a lot about the room renovations that you guys have done obviously reinvested into lot of your retail in SMB as well. For 2017 and going forward is there much left to do on if SMB in retail side in terms of reinvestment or are you guys pretty much up to speed there? Mark Frissora : We\u2019ve a lot runway on food and beverage for example I think that we invested in some executive talent in that area last year and trying to standardize our food and beverage offerings trying to learn best practices from around the enterprise you believe it or not we haven't done a lot of that we have focused as much on hospitality in food and beverage has some of the other competitors have. So we think that\u2019s opportunity for us to grow as we help ourselves in terms of getting standards that certain properties already hit. Vegas as a very strong line up and we keep introducing along The LINQ promenade a lot of new tenants that we think are marquee and helping build traffic there on The LINQ promenade as well. John DeCree : Thank you. That's it for me. Mark Frissora : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Kayler from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. James Kayler : Hi, guys, how are you doing? Mark Frissora : Good. Eric Hession : Hi, Jim. James Kayler : Just one big picture question just on sort of promotional environment and marketing. I mean it seems that broadly the whole industry has kind of gotten smarter and more targeted with more efficient with marketing. Yes various sort of what your views are in terms of what you see from your competitors and then from what you're doing. If you think that this sort of new approach to marketing is here to stay or if the economy as economy gets better that you know people can start to ramp up promotions again. Mark Frissora : I mean it's hard to predict what competitors are going to do you know on a given day. When they come into a new market and oftentimes they have to promote heavily first get share that conscript the whole market if other people compete and they try to actually you know stop that share loss. So when you introduce new competitors in a market that's a difficult one to talk about if you take the place like Las Vegas, which right now anyways today and maybe not two or three years now, but today we have a pretty much stable universe, it seems like that\u2019s worked out really well. We continue to reduce our marketing reinvestment dollars and we continue to gain share. And so we feel very good about up to the Las Vegas that\u2019s about 66% - 67% of our total EBITDA. When we look at outside of there and we go into some of the regional markets if you stay a case by case and some cases people or rational more rational other they aren\u2019t add to that. Feel free. Eric Hession : Yes, I think that\u2019s right as you knows from falling the company for a longtime we tried to be very targeted and mathematical with respect to our approach we made some fairly large enhancements to our ability to do that a couple of years ago and played a sizable impact in our performance, in our improved margins going up to this point. We continue to make advancements in these areas and as you know we're highly data intensive. Mark mentioned some of the machine learning capabilities that were rolling out, a lot of ads focused in the margin marketing area allowing for improved customer valuation ability and improved targeting in terms of direct mail. We also have enhanced sort order for customer contact for example that's driven by one of those algorithm and those are all really starting to play in terms of being able to either market more efficiently improve our response rates or to reduce cost through the efficiency associated with those marketing activities. James Kayler : Very good, that's helpful. Just changing gears a little bit, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on investors particularly in the room product in Vegas, which obviously is showing a lot of benefit. Curious what the view on the slot floors and slot investment are going forward. It seems like it's been less of a focus, I'm curious if that's going to change or if you're sort of focused on the non-gaming amenities more to drive growth? Mark Frissora : I think it\u2019s clear for us that we need to continue to reinvest in our stock products that along with some of the room product we were behind on and we put more capital work there. Last year, a little bit more capital. This is year, to say it\u2019s more significant. So we continue to reinvest in our slot product and we think that will obviously help drive growth and make us competitive and there's a lot of and start benefits from it as well. So I think there's again when you look at runway and earnings power I think as we continue to reinvest in the floor with new product that's going to be helpful for us to. Eric Hession : Yes, I'd only add to that we're also targeting some of the nontraditional investments when you look at what our offerings are. So we've launched some of the skill based games. Throughout the company, we're very aggressive and trying to put those on the floor and test with them. We're also introducing various carnival games. We're also putting inside beds and recently for example we did a Oculus lounge here at Caesars Palace. So we're trying to come up with new technology and introducing it to the floor in a variety means, not just from a gambling perspective, but also from an entertainment perspective to either drive trial, people coming to the property or to increase visitation. James Kayler : Great. Really helpful. Thank you, guys. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza from Cowen. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Lance Vitanza : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to go back actually to the CEOC question about the one-time benefits and I did hear the commentary earlier, but I'm wondering if you can help me quantify that in terms of the dollar amounts and X those items, did you in fact see revenue and EBITDA growth in the quarter or to what extent did you see revenue EBITDA growth in the quarter? Eric Hession : Sure. If you're specifically talking about the Ohio one-time benefits, that was $83.5 million basically cash receipt. We booked it as revenue for the quarter, so you'll see that reflected in our revenue numbers. We seem that to be one-time in nature. Therefore, from our adjusted EBITDA perspective, we did not include it. So our adjusted EBITDA from our perspective is an accurate measure in terms of year-over-year performance relative to that particular adjustment. I'm not sure if you're asking about others as well, but we did at the CEOC level we did see growth on a year-over-year basis. Lance Vitanza : That's great. That's actually a big help. Last for me is just you know and I appreciated the commentary earlier around potential long-term optimal capital structure that makes all the sense in the world to me. It got me thinking that presumably if you were to refinance everything up at the new CEC level someday that would not only have a bearing on your rates, but also would simplify your financial reporting requirements quite a bit, I guess is that correct and is that relevant to you? Mark Frissora : It is correct and it's also are very relevant. We take that into consideration. As you know, we put out numerous 10-K's into 10-Q's that certainly consumes resources, it consumes expense. We have two listing fees et cetera. There is no question that post emergence when we simplify the capital structure we will reduce expenses associated with just the general complexity of the capital structure. From an interest rate perspective, as I mentioned, we\u2019re are in constant discussions with banks and advisors and exploring various possibilities in terms of the optimum capital structure, we would air on simplicity. However, to the extent that that's not the optimal way to finance or restructure from an interest rate perspective, the Company we considered something else. Lance Vitanza : Thanks very much and congratulations on the strong quarter. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Eric Hession : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question period. I\u2019d now like to turn the call to Mr. Brian Blackman. Brian Blackman : Thank you very much for everyone for attending today's call and we look forward to checking back for our first quarter results in a few months. Have a good afternoon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Eric will then review our financial results before Mark concludes with some closing comments, we will then open up the call for your questions. If you turn to Slide 7, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Okay. Thank you, Brian. And I\u2019m pleased to report that Caesars Entertainment delivered another quarter a solid financial and operating performance driven by higher Las Vegas hotel cash revenue growth and an associated increase in cash ADR. The first quarter results reflect our continued focus on improving operating efficiency as well as the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. The positive impact of our ongoing investments in our properties especially room product is particularly evident in these results. At CEC, what you which excludes CEOC first quarter net revenues increased 1.4% to $963 million net loss was $546 million largely due to a $466 million accrual related to the restructuring of CEOC. The accrual amount is mainly driven by CEC\u2019s stock price, because a significant portion of the liability would be settled in CEC common stock. Consequently the rise in CEC\u2019s share price in the first quarter led to the higher accrual. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $274 million, with the EBITDA margin rising 98 basis points year-over-year. On enterprise wide basis which add CEOC to CEC, first quarter net revenues decreased 1.4% to $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 1.1% to $551 million. EBITDA margin increased 65 basis points to 26.9%. Decline in enterprise wide revenues was driven by lower reimbursable management cost at CEOC related to the divestiture of the Ohio properties and impact of unfavorable hold at $15 million to $20 million over the year ago period. However, Las Vegas hotel revenues and other hospitality verticals helped offset the decline. If we sort of the influence the divestiture, enterprise wide revenues were up year-over-year, we generated all time record hotel cash revenues grew two out of the three months in the quarter, leading to 9.4% year-over-year increase in this vertical. We achieve this monthly hotel cash revenue records even with over 90,000 room nights out of service for renovation. Our properties benefited from strong demand and increase rates as well as the positive impact of our hotel yield optimization processes. EBITDA further benefited from increased operating efficiency, lower operating expenses. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable hold while gaming volume was flat year-over-year on an enterprise-wide basis. Regional markets as a whole underperformed Las Vegas, reflecting a generally weaker regional economic environment, the first quarter had one fewer day and one less weekend than the year ago quarter, negatively impacting the year-over-year comparison. The effect was more evident in regional markets than it was in Las Vegas. The success of our room innovation projects starting to come online was clear in the first quarter with Las Vegas cash ADR at 11% Enterprise-wide. On Slide 8, you will see the investments in our Las Vegas properties are not only driving cash ADR but when combined with our customer focus hospitality initiatives, we are also increasing share. On a net revenue basis we gained 200 basis points of Las Vegas market Enterprise-wide over the last nine quarters, reflecting our success and differentiating our offerings. Over the same period EBITDA surged 52% and EBITDA margin rose 850 basis points Enterprise-wide. On Slide 9, we highlight our Enterprise-wide strength in Las Vegas for the first quarter. Specifically when looking a gaming volume market share, adjusted EBITDA margin and net revenue per marketing dollars, we maintained share while improving profitability compared to the prior year period. In addition to our continued financial execution, we also made great progress towards the resolution of the CEOC\u2019s restructuring. Following core approval of the reorganization plan in early Q1, CEOC successfully price a $1.4 billion senior secured credit facility at LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission approved the merger as Caesars Entertainment and Caesars Acquisition company and we are optimistic that CEOC will emerge in Chapter 11 during the second half of third quarter. With the restructuring concluded management will be able to turn its full attention towards strategic priorities and realize the full growth potential of the business. We are also working on reducing the cost of capital at CGPH and CERP. CGPH reprises existing $1.14 billion term loan B and subject to receive a regulatory approvals raised in additional $175 million repay the entire loan at the Cromwell. We anticipate this action will reduce our annualized interest expense by roughly $38 million. We have also launched the repricing effort on the CERP credit facility and is successful, we also realized further annual interest savings of over $50 million. As I have mentioned on previous calls and can be seen on Slide 10, our four points are showing initiatives going to basis of our plan to expand margins and grow cash flows to revenue and efficiency initiatives while driving employee engagement and customer satisfaction. On Slide 11, we look at the first of those four pillars with progress on enhancing our hospitality and loyalty programs. During the first quarter, we continue to focus on growing the number of members in the elite tiers of our total rewards program and enhancing members benefits. First quarter's spending by total rewards members reflects our success with VIP members spending up 6.8%. During the quarter we launched total rewards dinning, which allow members to earn reward credits by dinning that anyone of over a 11,000 restaurants, bars and clubs nationwide. Outside the U.S. we also extended our relationship with the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas with a significant number of guest taking advantage of partnership. Guest earnings rewards towards the Atlantis partnership program have exhibited higher gaining and total spend in our properties. We continue to invest heavily in our Play By Total Rewards mobile app which was downloaded for the 1 million times last month, which 1 millionth member winning a complimentary trip to Caesars property here in Las Vegas. We remained focused on further enhancing total rewards with new features including a itinerary service, coordinated omni-channel communications and location based messaging capabilities. These efforts are directly linked to our goals of increasing customer engagement and satisfaction and intern expanding spending at our properties. Turning to Slide 12, investment in Caesars infrastructure in Las Vegas and regional properties continue to drive our financial performance and long-term value preposition. With the room in property renovation plan in place through 2020. these efforts are aimed at delighting our customers, further improving customer satisfactions scores and continuing to drive cash ADR higher. We plan to refresh approximately 7,000 rooms across the enterprise during 2017 and by the end of the year we have upgraded more than half of our Las Vegas portfolios since 2014. In the first quarter, we began work on 1,100 Palace Tower rooms at Caesars Palace. As planned in Hollywood, we are nearly halfway through our renovations over 2,000 a project we expect to complete by the end of the second quarter. Our Las Vegas investments continue to be an excellent use of capital representing low risk and high return opportunities. Moving to Slide 13 we are investing nationwide with projects underway of several regional properties and here at Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, we are renovating 450 rooms in the Bayview Tower as well as making a number of other hospitality and food and beverage related improvements. These projects were helped to maximize the performance of the water front conference center deliver a more competitive room product, boost the incremental cash ADR, as well as help to drive banquet revenues. We also recently completed renovating approximately 500 rooms at Horseshoe Southern Indiana in the first quarter of 2017. In terms of post renovation results our room refreshed at Harrah's Gulf Coast in Velocity completed in May of 2016 has delivered excellent results with lodging revenues rising more than 20% year-over-year in the first quarter. Slide 14 details some of the continuous success of our entertainment strategy. Core to this strategy is making our Las Vegas venues the destination for headliner acts that are filed to a wide array of audiences. As part of this strategy our Las Vegas venues particularly the Colosseum and the Axis have become known as the destination for a roster of headliners that are appeal to a wide range of visitors who come to Las Vegas every day. Many of our entertainers are the primary reasons some visitors travel to Las Vegas. Key additions to our headliner line-up include The Backstreet Boys, the best-selling boy band of all-time. They gave their Las Vegas show Backstreet Boys, larger than live in March at the Axis. Their 26th show residency is one of the fastest selling shows in Las Vegas history. In the opening weeks of their residency The Backstreet Boys set a new record twice for the largest residency audiences in Las Vegas history. The early success of this new shows consistent with our other recent successes in the entertainment. This summer the Who, one of the rocks\u2019 most legendary and defining refining bands where launched in Las Vegas residency The Colosseum, we will also welcome to return a Pitbull's times of our lives residency to be accessed in late summer 2017. Overall our headliner business continues to drive incremental hotel gaming and food and beverage traffic. Looking to Slide 15, and our strategy aimed to enhancing the customer experience, we continue to invest in our offerings including breaking new ground in the gaming innovation space. In March, we announced Las Vegas first-to-market interactive video gaming experience Planet Hollywood and our Harrah's Resorts, Southern California is now the first to deploy the skills based gambling tables in California. Planet Hollywood is initially featuring two new offerings, Gamblit Poker and Cannonbeard\u2019s Treasure, both of which provide a completely new social competitive gaming experience that guests can enjoy together. The new games had received promising reviews thus far. Pending final, regulatory approval, additional interactive skill based games will be installed at our various properties throughout Nevada. We have also moved to support our gaming innovation leadership with the appointment of Christian Stuart, as the Executive Vice President of Gaming and Interactive Entertainment. The newly created role and exemplifies our commitment to being a leading gaming innovator in our industry. Our strategy here focused on offerings at the intertwine mobility, technology and innovation of best-in-class gaming, hospitality and entertainment. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our business process improvement efforts, focusing on increasing the efficiency of our operating model. A good example is the latest update on our check-in and check-out kiosk program, improving on first generation kiosk pilots, we are reducing customer check-in and the wait times and lowering costs, all while improving the customer experience. At Planet Hollywood, where we launched our latest generation kiosk hardware, utilization rates of the kiosk hit 26% of all guests within weeks of deployment. Overall, kiosks are reducing front desk check-in times by 40% while improving total service scores more than any other single initiative on record. Due to the success, we have experienced in Las Vegas, we are expanding the kiosk product other markets in Atlantic City is next on the list. We constantly look for ways to optimize our operations, marketing and technology programs to improve the customer experience, increase visitation and drive productivity to our key customer engagement channels. I will now ask Eric to provide a more detailed review of this quarter\u2019s results. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start with a review of CEC\u2019s results, followed by a review of the Company\u2019s reportable segments and supplemental information which will include CEOC\u2019s performance as well. Slide 18 summarizes CEC\u2019s results, which do not include CEOC as it is not consolidated nor CIE\u2019s social and mobile games business as it was sold in September of 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, CEC\u2019s net revenues increased 1.4% to $963 million, mainly driven improved by Las Vegas hotel performance, this was offset by lower gross gaming revenues due to unfavorable and hold a lower gamin volume primarily at CGP. Net loss for CEC is 546 million in the quarter compared to a net loss of $308 million in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in a net loss of $3.71 per share compared to the net loss of $2.12 per share in the year ago period. Year-over-year declines in net income and earnings per share were driven primarily by $466 million related to the restructuring of CEOC. As Mark, noted earlier as the CEC start price rises, we incur a high accrual related to the restructuring of CEOC since the significant portion of the liability will be settled in CEC common stock. Accordingly, the rise in our share price during the first quarter towards the cost that grow higher and negatively impacted net income. Due to this charge, we believe it's beneficial to provide adjusted EBITDA figures to provide visibility into our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% to $274 million with a margin increase of 98 basis points mainly due to higher hotel revenues and improved operating efficiencies partially offset by lower growth gaming and food and beverage revenues. Hold was estimated to have an unfavorable effect on operating income of between $10 million and $15 million for the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $15 million and $20 million when compared to the prior year period. Turning to Slide 19, Caesars Entertainment resort property delivered a strong first quarter performance. Net revenues were up 3% year-over-year to 546 million due to increased hotel cash revenues and higher gaming volume. Gross gaming revenues increased 3% year-over-year despite unfavorable hold during the quarter. Hotel performance improved with the completion of the rooms of Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas and Paris as well as improved results of Flamingo, all of which helped drive a 10% year-over-year increase in hotel revenues and higher cash ADR. CERP's hotel performance benefited as room nights out of service in the first quarter of 2017 drops to 19,000 compared to 47,000 out of service in the year ago quarter. Going forward, we anticipate a reversal in this trend and expect a negative impact as rooms will be out of service undergoing renovation in Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas, Flamingo and Laughlin during the second half of the year. CERP's net income increased $22 million year-over-year to net income of $6 million compared to a loss in the year a ago period. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.2% year-over-year to $171 million with adjusted EBITDA margins up 139 basis points to 31% mainly due to higher hotel and gaming revenues partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable year-over-year hold and room nights out of service due to a fire at the Rio in Las Vegas. Hold was estimated to have an unfavorable impact on operating income of between $0 million and $5 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $5 million and $10 million when compared to the prior year period. Slide 20 summarizes the performance of Caesars growth partners. Caesars growth partner's net revenues of $421 million in the first quarter declining 1% year-over-year primarily due to a decrease in gross gaming revenues related to unfavorable hold and a sizable amount of room nights out of service due to our renovation schedules, partially offset by strong cash ADR growth in Las Vegas. CGP growth gaming revenues declined due to unfavorable holding New Orleans and Baltimore as well as weaker gaming volumes in Baltimore related to an anticipated increase in competition and a short-term dealer shortage. We have taken steps to recruit new dealers at Horseshoe Baltimore and expect to have a staff ramps backups towards the end of the current quarter. Hotel cash revenues were flat year-over-year a strong ADR offset the impact of room outages. CGP was impacted by more than 38,000 room nights off the market in the current quarter, primarily related to renovations with Planet Hollywood versus zero room nights out of service due to room renovation in the year ago quarter. CGP net income decreased $27 million year-over-year to $7 million primarily attributable to lower net income from discontinued operations associated with the sale of our social and mobile games business at CIE and accelerated depreciation due to room renovations at Planet Hollywood slightly offset by lower stock-based compensation of CIE. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.9% year-over-year to $109 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 77 basis points due to lower year-over-year operating expenses across marketing and labor as well as reduced gaming taxes at Baltimore as a result of the slot tax reduction initiated in December of 2016. We estimate that Hold had an unfavorable impact on our operating income of between $10 million to $15 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $5 million and $10 million, when it compared to the prior year period. Slide 21, shows supplemental information on CEOC\u2019s first quarter performance. Net revenues decreased by approximately 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. The decline in revenues was attributable to lower reimbursable management cost of approximately $32 million related to the divestiture of Ohio properties, lower gaming volume and lower food and beverage revenues. It's important to note that while the lower reimbursable cost negatively impacted revenues, it did not have a similar effect on operating income as there is an offset of an equal reduction in expenses. Hotel revenues rose as a result of higher cash ADR at Caesars Palace reflecting the newly renovated investments in the [Augustus and Julius] (Ph) towers. Room nights out of service in the quarter totaled 32,000 down from 47,000 in the prior year period. At CEOC adjusted EBITDA decreased 2.8 to $276 million primarily driven by lower gaming revenues partially offset by higher hotel revenues and cost efficiency improvements. EBITDA margins however increased 18 basis points from the prior year period due to lower operating expenses and the elimination of the pass through revenue associated with the Ohio properties. We estimate that Hold of the ahead of favorably effect on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $0 million and $5 million when we compared to the prior year period. Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 22 for additional supplemental information on the entire enterprise for the first quarter, which includes CEC and CEOC. Caesars enterprise wide net revenues were down 1.4% to $2.0 billion, the decrease was primarily due to lower net revenues at CEOC I have described earlier, lower gaming revenues related to unfavorable hold and a 2% decline in food and beverage revenues. These factors were partially offset by the strength in hotel revenues which were up 6.4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% year-over-year to $551 million and margins expanded 65 basis points primarily due to higher hotel cash revenues and low operating expenses all partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year hold. Hold is estimated to have an unfavorable impact on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and unfavorable effect of between $15 million and $20 million when compared to the prior year period. As we move to the second quarter of 2017 from an enterprise wide perspective we have faced headwinds of approximately $20 million due to favorable hold in the second quarter of 2016 as well as inflationary cost pressures including salary and benefits. We remain diligent in managing these pressures in the quarter and beyond through our business process improvement initiatives. We also expect the ongoing room renovations across our hotel portfolio will results in the greater inventory disruptions this year with an estimated 18,000 more room nights out of service enterprise wide in the second quarter of 2017 versus the same period in 2016, which we will also attempt to mitigate. Additionally, we are monitoring the performance of Horseshoe Baltimore as it absorbs the presence of a new competitor. Slide 23, provides a summary of quarter and liquidity, and projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. Our investments in high return low risk areas such as room renovations coupled with our more efficient operating model has resulted in improved cash flow profile. At CEC, we generated $125 million in cash from operating activities in the first quarter roughly doubled the year ago quarter. Cash flow was largely used to reinvest in our core business through property renovations as well as the acquisition of additional real estate located behind our link hotel. We also leveraged operating cash flow to completely repaid $40 million of revolver that was outstanding for CERC. We will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our cash flow through efficiencies and profitable growth investments to drive value to our stakeholders. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark, for closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks, Eric. Please turn to Slide 25. In summary, the company\u2019s first quarter performance reflected the continued successful execution of our strategic objectives including the positive impact of several of our newly completed renovation projects coming online. The 9% year-over-year increase in enterprise wide cash ADR is clear evidence for the value we are creating by investing in our properties and ultimately our ability to deliver and improved customer experience. Our strict focus on continuous improvement for enhanced operating efficiencies with net revenue per employee rising 7% over the last nine quarters. As we continue to execute on our cornerstone initiatives, improving an aggressive capital investment plan in place through 2020 to refresh our properties. We are laying the groundwork for further improvements in our operating performance, margin expansion, and long-term profitability. On an enterprise wide level, recent capital markets activities were reduced interest rate expense and improved future cash flows, as we seek to complete CEOC\u2019s restructuring, we are laying the foundation for new growth opportunities to expand our network and increase shareholder value. We will now open the line for Q&A. And we would ask that you keep the questions focused on business performance please. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chad Beynon. Sir your line is open. Chad Beynon : Hi, great. thanks for taking my question. First off, I wanted to start with margin expansion, Mark you ended with that. And more importantly just focusing on the Las Vegas property margin opportunities. You mentioned some of the efficiencies that you have initiated here and we can see the result in the margin. Can you just help us think about either flow through maybe margin upside sustainability in terms of what you\u2019re able to produce this quarter, to just kind of give us some better goal post in terms of what some medium terms goals could be for Las Vegas margins? Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yes, I mean I think because we have got so many rooms that will be under refurbishment for the next several years. I think the cash ADR which is a number that flows quite readily all the way through to the bottom-line that cash ADR number will continue to be significant. We haven't gotten involved in kind of predicting what it is, but we feel good about the fact that we continue to have quite a few number of rooms yet to finish if you will. And then in addition to that on kind of reengineering efforts or continuous improvement efforts, our continuous improvement program really got started and Earns last year and it's gaining momentum and we are getting more and more project, more high quality projects where we increased the number of Black Belts that we have in the company and we will continue to increase that over the next two years frankly. And so that will gain momentum we believe because these projects again, the requirement is they have to hold neutral to improve customer satisfaction and as well as improve employee engagements. So we are doing this in a very positive way and we are doing it with just sophisticated technology improvements in some cases, gives us continuous improvement, productivity, other things like the kiosk, but even just reengineering the planning that we do at the front desk or at a buffet and making sure that we turn to seats faster. So just a lot of what I would call using math and science to improve customer satisfaction through continuous improvement efforts, that\u2019s going to continue when we are building that into the culture. I would say that we are not even half way through that journey yet. Chad Beynon : Okay, thank you. And then turning to CEOC\u2019s first quarter performance, you noted that the result was affected by lower casino revenues, we have seen from a lot of the regional gaming operators that things did turn more positive as we got further along in the quarter. Can you confirm that this happened with you guys and maybe just kind of an overall outlook in terms of how you are viewing the general regional business at this time given that January and February months had some difficult weather and difficult calendar and it appears to turn more positive way? Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure Chad, this is Eric. Yes, it was a very interesting quarter from a calendar perspective. New Year had a odd effect on January and then you know in February due to leap year there was a day less. There is also the tax return phenomenon and as a result when you look at the gaming revenues published by the states and the commentary of our competitors and we would echo the same results here. January and February were fairly challenging months and then March was quite robust. I would say at this point due to all of the different factors affecting the first quarter, it's very difficult for us to tell whether there has really been a change in any of the trends that we saw last year. We will hopefully have the results in March continue, but I think it's too early to predict anything along those lines. Broadly speaking, we continue to see weakness in the Louisiana Mississippi region and again we have talked about some in past calls where we believe that that is primarily driven by the local economy being focused on the oil and gas industry given the change in pricing and lapping some of the reductions in the oil pricing. Hopefully that will subsides. And then the rest of the regional markets as I mentioned were fairly volatile month-to-month and so I hate to call it trend at this point in time given that that volatility caused by the calendar shifts and what tax turns. Mark Frissora : And I'll just add to Eric's comments. I think that obviously we have our own internal plan and never stretched plan, I mean we pretty much I would say predicted what the gaming demand has been as well as the hospitality demand. We feel like we have been exceeding our plans so there has been those surprises to the down side. But March it was a positive month, we saw some nice kind of what I would say continuation of those trends in the first couple of weeks of April. So again we are hopeful, but it's too soon as Eric said to predict exactly what this is going to mean the rest of the year. But overall we feel pretty good about where we are from our plan standpoint and that we have been exceeding our plan so. Chad Beynon : Great, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Farber [Credit Suisse]. Sir, your line is open. David Farber : I had just three questions. I wanted to first just on the operations side, there continues to be a significant amount of investment in Las Vegas from you and your competitors in both the hotel product and some large non-gaming projects. I was curious given some of the underutilized land you have in the deck and you've talked about in the past if you are at all considering incremental investment in Vegas away from the hotel rooms as you build cash and what types of projects might you consider in Las Vegas or if not maybe otherwise in other states the jurisdictions and then I had some follow-ups. Thank you. Mark Frissora : Eric and I will both answer this, but I certainly believe as this is one of the biggest investments thesis for us going forward post the merger and so as that we have a lot of great, great land available that is obviously underdeveloped right now center strip and we you might imagine we have talked a lot about that internally and we have a lot of plans. And as those plans are well defined and we think they are very great projects that have nice significant returns to them and its efforts are near and dear to our heart and so we feel positively about the future and our development of Las Vegas. Eric you do want to add to that on regions as well as anything else in Vegas. Eric Hession : Yes, the thing I would add David is that, that we do continue to be very bullish on Las Vegas as a market, when you think about those supply and demand dynamics in this market it's positive for the existing operators. The supply from both Southern California as well as the air traffic continues to show that there is strong demand as well as the group business keeps holding up and then from the demand perspective and then from the supply perspective there doesn\u2019t seem to be a much expansion on the horizon at least in the next two to three years. And so from that dynamic when you get high hotel occupancy rates as we have seen, your ADRs can really rise and that's what we are experiencing here in Las Vegas. So from that standpoint, we continue to believe our investment in the room products is a very good one, as we have seen this year we are planning to renovate around 7,000 hotel rooms which will be a very large effort on our part significant amount of capital and much higher than what we would expect to invest in future years and we do expect to get solid returns from those. As mark mentioned, we have sizeable land holdings on the east side of approximately 80 to 90 acres and then we own about seven acres of undeveloped plan in front of Caesar\u2019s towers all of which would be prime for potential development from additional convention space to retail to other confidence that our customers would desire. David Farber : Okay, very good. Just on CEOC for a minute, there has obviously been some very strong results over the past year especially in the margin side. You spoke to us a little bit in the Q&A, but I guess my question is given the magnitude of the improvement and then this first quarter\u2019s results, curious if you think we may get a peak perhaps in EBITDA, absent new revenue or how do you guys think about CEOC, if the EBITDA or it\u2019s margin profile going forward given that improvement over the last year plus. And then I had one quick question on the cash structure. Thanks. Mark Frissora : I guess, you know my comment would be that we feel like there is still plenty of runway for improvement, we have again I mean very methodical about how we govern the rate of improvement, because we don\u2019t want to overly stress the organization on the plans that we have, we have a lot of plans yet for improvement to go forward with. And I think that this quarter I think you heard us talk about what I would call bad hold if you will year-over-year, and as well as having 90,000 room nights out. So there is a lot of moving pieces, but as you kind of neutralize those pieces and normalize and again for us a solid quarter and within feeding our plan and I think that we have tried to make sure that the fast-forward has not only a lot of growth in it, saw growth initiatives, some of those were starting to really kick-in now. We work really hard on our application on total rewards we have worked really hard on mobile booking in our websites and those initiatives are really paying off for us. David Farber : Okay. Thanks for that. And the just quickly, you have been in the loan market recently, I was curious to hear if there is any updated thoughts on what CEOC\u2019s emergence could look like. You talked about the second half of the third quarter and I guess my question specifically is there any updated thoughts on potential refinancing for the high yield portion of either CERC or growth venture partners? Thanks and that\u2019s it. Mark Frissora : Sure David, as you know we have been fairly active in the loan market with respect to securing the CEOC exist financing. We also re-priced our CGPH facility and upsized to take advantage of rates with respect to retiring the Cromwell debt pending regulatory approval. And then we are in the market to CERP term loan. It\u2019s not a lost on us that there is a additional potential opportunity with respect to the bonds. The bonds do come with associated call premium and also they would be refinanced with other bonds then there would be additional if we were to eventually refinance the entire structure and to complete merger of the two facilities. We were certainly active in discussions in and outs as trying to figure out the best way to optimize our cost-to-capital. So rest is shared we are looking at all the possibilities and we will take advantage of the market conditions when they present themselves, but right now we are primarily focused on CERP term loan with pricing and making sure that we are able to exit the restructuring as soon as possible. David Farber : Very good. Thanks for taking all the questions. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of [Michael Keith] (Ph). Sir, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thank you. Actually just a follow-up on a last one a little more, Eric just relative to emergence, are you able to consider merging CGP and CERP prior to that, do we need to wait for that? And then as it relates to potentially considering refinancing bonds, is that also something that it needs to wait for those two events to happen? And do your current credit facilities that are new allow an easy path to that? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yes, so unfortunately I don\u2019t have a clear answer for you because we do evaluate all the options based on how the market conditions are and all the information that we have at the time as I mentioned to try to come up with a ultimate capital structure that has lowest cost to capital for the company. In this particular case, merging the two facilities is particularly challenging given that they are currently owned by two different public companies. And so that likely we have to wait until after the emergence simply from a practical nature of the collateral being held by two different entities. The term loans that we are currently repricing should not have any impact or negative cost associated with any of our future actions, they both will consist of a tougher repricing of six months but otherwise they can be retired at par. So the actions that we are taking with respect to CGPH and CERP should have no negative effects long-term with respect to our capital decisions. And from a positive side it allows us to take advantage of the current market conditions and lock-in some of the strong interest savings that we can anticipate to realizing the future. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. And then Eric, you also talked about a $20 million hold headwind in the second quarter of this year and then there was something else you mentioned with salaries, I\u2019m sorry I missed that so some clarity there? And then that the hold headwind was that enterprise wide and if it was is there any rough numbers you can give on the three silos? Eric Hession : Sure, so the enterprise wide Hold impact was about $20 million plus. We didn\u2019t provide guidance broken up by the various silos but just wanted to highlight. And to your second question with respect to the salaries and wages as we go through with various contacts with our employees as well as increases in salaries and benefits there is general inflation that comes through with respect to those categories. Our expectations are where that we challenge our management team to offset those is increases productivity actions, however we do like to call out the fact that we are experiencing increases from an inflationary perspective in those categories. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks and then just one last one, where do you expect to be at year-end 2017 in terms of percentage of property renovations and then just looking forward how much more do you have to do in the years following 2017? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yes, as you know we were very active, we have got slightly over 35% of our rooms completed now and we would anticipate at the end of 2017 to be at around 56% completed and that's completed since the 2014 so these will be a very fresh room night. As I have mentioned previously as we anticipate this year being our peak CapEx year and going forward we would expect to continue at a slowly elevated pace about our long-term capital requirements would need, but we will be able to do fewer and fewer rooms in 2018, 2019 and 2020 before getting down in 2021 to a flat run rate over the long-term expected amount of capital that we would be spending. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John DeCree [Union Gaming]. Sir, your line is open. John DeCree : Hey everyone, thanks for the questions. If I could just build on the last question, Eric given how the how high the ROI has been on the room renovations and this year being up of the peak CapEx year. Is there any thought or opportunity to pull some of the room renovations from 2019 or 2020 forward a little bit to begin renting that up or is it just maybe too much inventory disruption. Eric Hession : Yes, it's a good observation and I'll make a couple of comments on that one is our current plan does really do what your describing, which is that we have accelerated along of the room renovations into this year because we felt that the return were so strong and because of our performance over the past two years it supported us the ability to have the cash side in the various credits to be able to perform those activities. As you have seen and as we highlighted we do have construction disruption that we have to then offset through various means so it's somewhat disruptive. Going forward however once we have this year done, we believe that we will have a core group of rooms and with the 56% that will be sufficient quantities at all of our properties to handle the group business as well as the casino business and thus the urgent need to upgrade the product isn\u2019t as necessary and therefore we are able to back-off and slow it down a little bit. The other thing I would comment is that although we are experiencing strong improvements in ADR from these renovated rooms and thus high returns on that capital that we are investing at some point that's going to diminished. Once we get a certain percentage of the room nights complete the marginal room that's renovated doesn\u2019t provide the same return that the earlier rooms provided. And when that happens we don\u2019t know, at this point we are still experiencing a good returns on these projects, but at some point in the future that will flip and just become more and maintenance related project as opposed to driving growth. John DeCree : Got it, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then maybe higher level question Mark, I think you guys have both discuss a little bit about potential development opportunities in Las Vegas, I was wondering as the rework of CEOC kind of comes to a conclusion hopefully at the end of 3Q how you guys think about some other strategic priorities whether would be M&A or potentially development outside of Las Vegas. Any high level comments on how you are kind of thinking about that going forward? Mark Frissora : I think it's fair to say that we have had a lot of time to plan and look at projects outside of Las Vegas and we have got a pretty good list of what I would call targets I guess and Eric and the team have done a really good job identifying what those are, what we think the expected returns would be and were fairly bullish, that we will be able to generate some good inorganic growth through M&A activity as well as activity as well as licensing opportunities, we have cadre of about five different categories of growth that once we emerge we will be able to start executing again. So we are pretty prepared for that and excited to be able to start talking about it once we emerge. John DeCree : Great. Thank you, everyone. Operator : And we have a follow-up question Chad Beynon. Sir, your line is open. Chad Beynon : Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a maintenance question. Eric regarding the classification of the [indiscernible] property, is this now excluded or was this excluded from the quarterly consolidated EBITDA and kind of your LTM rolling historical EBITDA number? Eric Hession : Yes, that\u2019s correct. The deconsolidation of [Indiscernible] from 2016, Q1 perspective, if you recall our prior reporting said $304 million of EBITDA, and now we are showing $284 million and that\u2019s to request the removal of [indiscernible] and it\u2019s also reflected in the current period. The one thing I would also note for those building model is that it was also excluded from any of the information that we included in our S4. So those projections are also excluded [Indiscernible]. Chad Beynon : Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all from me. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Eric Hession : Thank you. Operator : And now, I would like to turn it back over to Brian Blackman for closing remarks. Brian Blackman : Alright. With that, on behalf of the company would like to thank everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call, and we look forward to checking back few months for our second quarter results. Have a great day. Operator : Thanks for joining us. This does conclude our broadcast. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

If you turn to Slide 7, I can turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Okay, thank you Joyce. Caesars Entertainment delivered second quarter results in-line with our expectations, despite considerable headwinds. As we anticipated and described on our last call, second quarter results were impacted by inflationary cost pressures, inventory disruptions from room nights off the market for renovation and a difficult competitive environment in Baltimore. We also have significantly favorable hold results in our Caesars Palace baccarat business in the second quarter of 2016, which did not repeat in 2017 further affecting year-on-year comparisons. Despite all of these factors, the underlying health of our business continued to improve, and we were able to offset some of these items with volume growth across the majority of our properties, early successes from new revenue growth initiatives and our constant focus on operational efficiencies. Our room innovation plan is moving forward with significant momentum. Our entertainment offerings are expanding with the opening of Caesars Entertainment Studios and we made two senior leadership appointments to repel the further growth of our company beyond its existing footprint. All of this progress positions Caesars Entertainment well to take advantage of additional opportunities following the conclusion of CEOC's restructuring. At CEC, which excludes CEOC, second quarter net revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat year-over-year at $289 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin narrowed by 39 basis points to 28.8%. CEC recorded a net loss before the effect of non-controlling interest of $1.4 billion, a $617 million improvement relative to the prior year's comparable period, driven by lower accruals related to the restructuring of CEOC.  Eric will get into the details of the operating performance at CEC later in the call. On an enterprise-wide basis, which adds CEOC to CEC, second quarter net revenues were down 1.7% to $2.1 billion, strong slot volume performance was offset by a $41 million year-over-year reduction in baccarat win at Caesars Palace and increased competition at Horseshoe Baltimore. Unfavorable year-over-year hold between $10 million and $15 million, lower reimbursable management cost at CEOC related to the divestiture of the Ohio properties and construction disruption due to incremental rooms off the market for renovation also impacted results. Excluding the volume impact of VVIP at Caesars Palace and performance in Baltimore net enterprise revenues improved, supported by 2% increase in slot volumes. Enterprise-wide operating income for the quarter increased 17% to $385 million. The decline in revenues led to a decrease in enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA of 6.3% to $565 million and EBITDA margin decreased 133 basis points to 27%. The shift in the Easter Holidays to Q2 in 2017 from Q1 last year negatively impacted EBITDA, and approximately 17,500 additional room nights off the market for renovation in Q2 versus last year also negatively impacted EBITDA by about $6 million. Total cash ADR was flat year-over-year with the increases driven by renovations at our Atlantic City properties, Harrah's Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood offset by soft performance at the Rio, Las Vegas. Despite year-on-year softness in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate that we will surpass our initially disclosed 2017 full-year EBITDA projections by at least $40 million before the anticipated deconsolidation of our Horseshoe Baltimore operations, which Eric will explain in more detail later. We have outperformed in the first half of the year relative to our plan and expect year-on-year performance to accelerate in the third quarter and the remainder of the year. We reduced our annual interest obligations by a total of approximately $110 million through two-term loan repricings executed during the second quarter and a recent refinancing of Horseshoe, Baltimore\u2019s debt executed in the third quarter. We expect to emerge with significantly reduced balance sheet leveraged and anticipate significant and annual interest savings from future refinancing subject to market conditions.  Moving to Slide 8, you can see that we have made good progress with the necessary approvals for CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy. We have received the necessary authorization to implement our restructuring from gaming authorities with Nevada, Missouri, and Louisiana still pending. In addition, we achieved another important milestone with stockholder approval for the merger of CEC and CAC received on July 25.  We anticipate the merger and restructuring will be completed within a few days after all regulatory approvals have been obtained. We are targeting completion of all transactions and to begin operations under the new company structure for the first week of October 2017. On Slide 9, we highlight our four cornerstone initiatives. As I have mentioned on previous calls, these four innovations are our plan to expand margins and grow cash flows through revenue and efficiency efforts, while driving employee engagement and customer satisfaction. We continue to make headwind in a successful execution of our plan. On Slide 10, we look at our progress in the second quarter against the first of those four pillars, enhancing our hospitality and loyalty programs. During the period, we launched a new loyalty partnership with Wyndham Rewards, the top-ranked hotel rewards program by U.S. News. The partnership provides a host of industry-leading products for total rewards members, including the immediate benefit of complementary status match with Wyndham Rewards and ability to transfer points across programs. This partnership provides us with a unique opportunity to increase traffic across our total rewards towards properties. We expect it to left occupancy by tens of thousands of room nights as Wyndham Rewards members will have the ability to book TR destinations across the U.S. and Canada directly through the Wyndham Hotel Group and Wyndham Rewards websites and other channels later this year. Separately, we have seen impressive use by our play by total rewards mobile app as the number of user sessions increased 195% year-over-year. Engagement via the app has proven to be to more valuable customer relationships as it gives a real time customized way to engage with guests. Turning to Slide 11, we are investing in our room product both in Las Vegas and regional properties as a core element of our efforts to enhance value. We plan to refresh nearly 6,000 rooms across the enterprise during 2017, which is down slightly from our prior estimate of $7000 as we have pushed out the start date for our Bally's Las Vegas renovation project to better accommodate seasonal demand. By the end of the year we will have upgraded approximately 50% of our Las Vegas portfolio since 2014. Planet Hollywood renovations were completed in June. This milestone marks the end of a 2,400 room project across the entire Hotel, which began in 2016. Also in Vegas, the 1,100 room renovation of the Palace Tower at Caesars, which includes the new 29 floor villas, is on track for completion this quarter and in July we began the renovation of another 950,000 rooms at Harrah's. The announced first stage of the flamingo renovation is scheduled to begin after Labor Day with completion expected in the second quarter of next year. The flamingo\u2019s prime location and loyal following make it one of our most iconic brands and we expect this 1,270 room project to unlock substantial value at this property. Lastly, at Bally's Las Vegas, we anticipate the start of a 2,050 room renovation project kickoff in late 2017. We are also investing in our regional room project with 230 rooms at Harrah's New Orleans to be renovated this year and our 410 room renovation at Laughlin scheduled to begin by year end. Renovations of 450 rooms in the Bayview Tower at Harrah's and Atlantic City are now complete with a number of other hospitality in food and beverage related enhancements also up and running just in time for the summer season in Atlantic City.  Slide 12 provides an overview of the renovation projects we have undertaken since 2015 with details in the details of the number of rooms remodeled and the various completion dates. Beyond the project still under way, we have a room and property renovation plan in place through 2020, which positions us well to maximize performance of our properties like delighting our guest and further improving customer satisfaction. Moving to Slide 13, beyond investments in our existing properties, we\u2019re pursuing broader growth opportunities for our brands and network. These include traditional M&A, international development projects, increasing the utilization of our real estate in Las Vegas and leveraging our leading brands through branding and licensing partnerships. We expect to have approximately $2 billion of cash in our balance sheet when CEOC emerges from bankruptcy. Following emergency CEC will have significantly reduced leverage and a strong free cash flow profile. We are actively evaluating users of capital to drive future growth. Given the announcement of these growth initiatives, and in order to support the plans that we're moving forward, we announced the appointment of two senior executives. Marco Roca joined Caesars Entertainment as President Global Development; and Mike Daly as Senior Vice President, Strategy and M&A. Marco brings more than 30 years of hotel and gaming development experience to Caesars Entertainment and will oversee all domestic and international development activity, including the pursuit and execution of new markets, as well as new projects within the company's existing property footprint. Mike Daly joins us from General Electric Capital where he was responsible for strategy M&A and corporate development. He will be responsible for defining and executing the company's growth strategies, including joint venture, strategic alliances and M&A. The additions of Marco and Mike will bring you to more focus to our domestic and international network expansion initiatives and help Caesars Entertainment unlock new growth channels. In terms of our Las Vegas asset activation plan, we have previously discussed the company's desire to build a 300,000 square-foot Convention Centre adjacent to The LINQ. We believe this is an attractive opportunity that could target the market for medium size business and association meetings rather than the exhibition business.  We believe this would be highly profitable opportunity across the enterprise given the incremental hotel and hospitality spend we generally capture from customers attending these kinds of meetings. Please watch for the future updates as our plans progress. Moving to Slide 14, we are expanding our celebrity chef concepts with new and exclusive food and beverage offers that are driving guest traffic. Gordon Ramsay for example is broadening his presence here in Las Vegas with his new Hell's Kitchen Restaurant at Caesars Palace, and in our regional properties with the opening of a new venue in Baltimore and more regional locations coming soon. Similarly, we are working to bring our partnership with Giada De Laurentiis to Baltimore. This is an exceptional opportunity to build on the success of Giada\u2019s first restaurant which is located at our Cromwell property here in Vegas. Caesars Entertainment is uniquely positioned to bring celebrity chef concepts to regional markets and will keep building on the track record of our existing offerings, which include Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill in Atlantic City and Guy Fieri's restaurant in Atlantic City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Laughlin. Slide 15 highlights important new investments in our entertainment offerings. We recently announced the opening of Caesars Entertainment Studios. The first full-service production studio in Nevada. This is a 48,000 square-foot state-of-the-art facility capable of hosting full-scale television, movie, eSports and special event productions.  With this studio, we are seeking to compete at the highest level of the film industry and are targeting all productions, not just Las Vegas focused projects. We\u2019re already off to a strong start having held a high successful eSports event in June and with who wants to be a millionaire now filming its latest season at the facility. Moving to Slide 16, also look forward to our entertainment strategy is making our Las Vegas venues the destination for headliner acts that appeal to a wider array of audiences, and we\u2019re building on strong momentum in Q1 with an impressive summer line-up. We\u2019re very proud to maintain our position as a leading promoter of live entertainment worldwide. The AXIS at Planet Hollywood maintained its position as the Number 1 theatre venue in the US with the Colosseum at Caesars Palace AT Number 3 based on ticket sales. The Jennifer Lopez All I Have residency at the AXIS achieved the second highest average ticket price worldwide in the second quarter outpacing all other Las Vegas residencies and concerts. Overall our headliner business continues to be an important driver of incremental hotel, gaming and food and beverage revenue. Several exciting acts we are proud to host at our venues include The Who and innovative circus spectacular called Circus 1903, and the Backstreet Boys whose larger-than-life residency has been extended into 2018.  Slide 17 details our ongoing effort to build on our leading gaming position through innovative offerings such as the eSports event just referenced. In partnership with Microsoft Xbox, we hosted two highly successful gears of all tournaments at our Caesars properties in Atlantic City and Las Vegas with a total of over 1,000 attendees and over 2 million online viewers. In partnership with Microsoft Xbox, we hosted two highly successful gears of award tournaments at our Caesars properties in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. These events have allowed us to further our development of a profitable and scalable operating model. We will continue to perform brand partnerships and hold additional tournaments over the balance of the year leveraging our vast portfolio of properties. Given the incredible market statistics for eSports we believe these tournaments will be a core feature of our product offering in the near future. We also recently announced that the World Series of Poker entrants and a leading Internet provider put in China reached a multi-year deal to grow the competitive game of poker throughout Asia. We are excited to tap into the huge potential to grow the WSOP brand in the region as the game increases in popularity. We also retooled WSOP's 2017 schedule to enable same day television coverage from the first day of the main event to the conclusion of the final table with play now finishing in the summer, instead of November, which will get more viewers engaged with the brand. The most recent WSOP event, which wrapped up last month, broke all records for entries, prize pool and revenue. We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in gaming dollars domestically by constantly operating offering new and innovative gaming experiences for adults of all generations. Turning to Slide 18, one cornerstone of our strategy has been fundamentals of driving margin outperformance and differentiation of our competitors is our continuous improvement culture. We have Black Belts trained in operational improvement covering every property. They are dedicated leaders accountable for financial targets for a focus on revenue, cost, and employing customer satisfaction initiatives. We\u2019re now shifting our focus toward driving incremental revenue opportunities. One example is paid parking, which completed rolling out across Las Vegas properties in April with solid early lessons. We see the potential reach up to $20 million in revenues per year from this initiative. We also anticipate to realizing incremental efficiency in revenue gains from the overhaul of our major systems. The first example is a new marketing platform powered by sales force that will enable us to optimize our marketing efforts, enhance customer satisfaction and drive revenue growth through expanded functionality. We\u2019ve started the system implementation process across the enterprise and anticipate completion of the full roll-up by mid-2018. This initiative is expected to deliver tens of millions of dollars of improvement over the next five years. We have a robust pipeline of projects across the organization and there will be more updates to come. Slide 19 outlines our progress on our fourth quarter cornerstone initiatives inspiring a sales and service culture. I\u2019m proud to report that we achieved record second quarter overall service and net promoter scores. We also earned four awards from Loyalty360, the association for customer loyalty, including the top honor of the top loyalty company.  We won the Number 1 casino program in three categories from the Freddie Awards, and we received four awards across our EMEA operations so far this year, including European casino operator of the year for the second year in a row. We have plans to roll out further training for employees and customer facing roles in our Las Vegas properties and our call center to support better customer engagement and further revenue growth. I want to reiterate that customer satisfaction is paramount to our long-term profitability and success. These results are a testament to professionalism and commitment to excellent service demonstrated by our staff worldwide, and I want to thank the Caesars team for continuing to go above and beyond to take care of its guests. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start with a review of CEC's results followed by a review of the company's reportable segments and supplemental information, which will include CEOC's performance as well. Slide 21 summarizes CEC's results, which did not include CEOC as it is not consolidated, nor CIE\u2019s social mobile and games business as it was sold in September 2016. As Mark mentioned earlier, CEC realized net revenues of approximately $1 billion for the second quarter of 2017, a 1% improvement against the prior year's corresponding period. Higher gaming volumes across most properties and incremental revenues from our operational initiatives were partially offset by performance in Baltimore, which reflects the presence of a new competitor this year. Net loss attributable to CEC was $1.4 billion in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in a net loss of $9.68 per share, compared with the net loss of $14.25 per share in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat year-over-year at $289 million with adjusted EBITDA margin down 39 basis points to 28.8%, primarily driven by the one-time settlements related to insurance claims. Hold was estimated to have a favorable impact on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million for the quarter relative to our expected hold and no impact when compared to the prior-year period. Turning to Slide 22, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties delivered solid second quarter performance. Net revenues rose 1.4% year-over-year to $570 million, due to higher revenues associated with operational initiatives, higher gaming volumes and increased total cash revenues. Gross gaming revenues were flat year-over-year, despite unfavorable hold. Hotel performance improved with results from Harrah's Las Vegas and Paris, which helped drive a 2.8% year-over-year increase in hotel revenues and higher cash ADR. CERP\u2019s hotel performance benefited as room nights off the market in the second quarter of 2017 dropped to approximately 2,000 rooms compared with over 10,000 rooms off the market in the second quarter of 2016, resulting in a benefit of approximately $1 million. While CERP rooms of the market are expected to increase year-on-year in the third quarter, a positive impact of EBITDA between $2 million to $3 million is anticipated as renovations will take place at properties with lower average daily room rates relative to last year. CERP\u2019s net income increased $7 million year-over-year to $15 million. Adjusted EBITDA and margins remained relatively unchanged year-over-year at $170 million and 31% respectively. While we saw top line growth, operating expenses also grew driven by one-time settlements related to insurance claims, which tempered the overall EBITDA growth.  Hold was estimated have an unfavorable impact on operating income of between $0 and $5 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable impact of between $0 and $5 million when compared to the prior-year period as well. Slide 23 summarizes the performance of Caesars Growth Partners. Net revenues were $435 million in the second quarter, relatively unchanged on a year-over-year basis. CGP gross gaming revenues declined due to weaker gaming volumes on Baltimore related to the anticipated increase in competition and a short-term dealer shortage despite favorable hold in New Orleans. We have taken steps to recruit new dealers at Horseshoe Baltimore and are expected to see improvement in this area as our staff ramps backup. Hotel cash revenues declined 3% year-on-year as CGP was impacted by more than 25,000 room nights off the market in the current quarter versus roughly zero room nights off the market in the prior-year period. Accounting for a headwind of approximately $4 million, primarily related to the renovations at Planet Hollywood. CGP net income increased $5 million year-over-year to $21 million, primarily attributable to higher interest income on the CIE restricted cash and lower interest expense supported by our debt reduction actions.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.4% year-over-year to $120 million and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 92 basis points due to favorable year-over-year hold, which was partially offset by weakness in Baltimore. We estimate that hold had a favorable impact on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and a favorable effect of between $0 and $5 million when compared to the prior-year periods.  Slide 24 shows supplemental information on CEOC's second quarter performance. Net revenue decreased by approximately 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Stable regional casino performance was offset by unfavorable year-over-year hold of between $10, $15 million and lower gaming volumes in the international VVIP business.  As Mark mentioned, this was mainly driven by Caesars Palace, Las Vegas where our baccarat business saw one year year-over-year decline in gross baccarat win of approximately $41 million. This was due to significantly favorable hold in the second quarter of 2016 and lower activity from VVIP players in the second quarter of 2017, due to the highly variable nature of the business. We expect baccarat player activity to increase in the second half of this year based on current bookings. CEOC also experienced lower reimbursable management costs related to the divestiture of our Ohio properties and lower food and beverage revenues in the second quarter of 2017. Hotel cash revenues declined primarily as a result of a higher percentage of room nights off the market at Caesars Palace which totaled approximately $28,000, up from approximately $19,000 in the second quarter of 2016, which accounted for a headwind of approximately $3 million. Cash ADR and occupancy were relatively unchanged on a year-over-year basis. At CEOC, adjusted EBITDA and margins decreased to $277 million and 25%, respectively from $315 million and 27% in the second quarter of 2016. The declines were primarily driven by the lower gaming revenues that we\u2019ve referenced earlier.  We estimate that hold had a favorable effect on operating income of between $0 and $5 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $10 and $15 million when compared to the prior-year periods. Now let\u2019s take a look at Slide 25 for additional supplemental information on the entire enterprise for the second quarter, which includes CEC and CEOC. Caesars Enterprise-wide net revenues were down 1.7% to approximately $2.1 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower net revenues at Caesars Palace and in Baltimore as described earlier, as well as lower gaming and food and beverage revenues related to the shift in the Easter Holiday for Q2 in 2017 from Q1 last year. These factors were partially offset by the strength in slot volume spot volume performance across most of our properties, higher occupancy, and cash reserve fees, and incremental revenues from our operational initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA decreased year-over-year to $565 million from $603 million and margins contracted 133 basis points, primarily due to lower VVIP gaming revenues at Caesars Palace Las Vegas, the competitive environment in Baltimore and the one-time insurance impact. This shift in the Easter Holiday to Q2 in 2017 from Q1 last year also had a negative impact on EBITDA, and approximately 17,500 additional room nights off the market had a negative impact of about $6 million. Hold was estimated to have a favorable impact on operating income of between $5 million and $10 million in the quarter relative to our expected hold and an unfavorable effect of between $10 and $15 million when compared to the prior year period. There is several factors to consider as we look forward into the third quarter of 2017 and the remainder of the year.  First as Mark mentioned, we anticipate deconsolidating our Horseshoe Baltimore operations in the third quarter as a result of certain terms within the joint venture agreement. Cash flows received by Caesars Entertainment will not change as a result of the deconsolidation. The property contributed approximately $29 million of adjusted EBITDAR for the enterprise year-to-date and our initially disclosed projections include an expected $53 million of adjusted EBITDA for the property for the full year. Moving forward, our projections will be adjusted to exclude Baltimore. So, it\u2019s also important to note that $320 million of debt at the property, which was recently refinanced down to $305 million, will also would no longer be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet going forward.  We expect to face additional inflationary cost pressures and headwinds from 19,800 room nights off the market for renovation in the third quarter versus the prior year period, but only expect a modest impact to hotel revenue, due to the timing and mix of those rooms being off-line. Although June was a particularly challenging month at Caesars Palace Las Vegas due to unfavorable VVIP win, July is showing improvement, which indicates that trips may have shifted between quarters. Despite these headwinds, we expect Caesars Palace and enterprise-wide performance to accelerate in the third quarter supported by strong demand within the group business, increased traffic from the international segment, and stronger regional gaming. We\u2019ve also added incremental business process improvement projects across the portfolio to offset some of the softness we anticipated in Q2, and expect these initiatives to drive margin expansion going forward. We remain confident in our ability to deliver targets for the full year and anticipate surpassing our consolidated EBITDA projections as initially disclosed by at least $40 million before the anticipated deconsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Slide 26 provides a summary of quarter-end liquidity and projected capital expenditures for the CEC consolidated entities. Our investments in high return low-risk areas such as room renovations coupled with our more efficient operating model have resulted in a strong cash flow profile, continuing CEC generated $95 million in cash from operating activities in the second quarter. We also reduced our interest obligations over the quarter through the CERP CGPH repricings with further reductions achieved in third quarter through the Baltimore refinancing. Looking ahead, we will continue to optimize our cash flow through efficiency, additional opportunity to reduce our cost of capital through refinancings, and profitable growth investments to drive value to our shareholders. Now, I will turn it back to Mark for closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks Eric and please turn to Slide 28. To recap, we continue to make headway on our cornerstone initiatives with new total reward partnerships, room product investments, including the Phase 1 renovation of the Flamingo, continuous business improvement projects, and further recognition for our customer service focus. We are optimistic that all approvals required for CEOC to emerge from bankruptcy will be received this quarter, and then we will begin operating under the new company structure in early October. As CEOC\u2019s restructuring comes to a conclusion, we will focus on revenue growth and efficiency initiatives to further improve our margins and cash flow. Once again, we want to reiterate that we feel good about our core business and we expect to exceed our full-year EBITDA projection. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today for our second quarter 2017 financial and operational results quarter. We\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A and we ask that you please keep your questions focused on the business performance. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Hi great, thanks for taking my questions. First, wanted to start on the guidance, Eric, Mark you both kind of touched on some of the positives in terms of why you are raising the guidance and Mark you just summarized saying that the core business is maybe a little bit stronger than expected, could you just kind of help us think about where you\u2019re seeing that strength, is it just revenue growth and the flow through is so strong that if you continue to see the revenue growth, you know that will go right to the bottom line or is there really just a combination of a lot of things that you put into place this year that are taking hold? Any additional color there would be helpful? Thanks. Mark Frissora : I will take a stab at it. We\u2019re seeing stronger revenue growth year-over-year in our core gaming business, we were seeing stronger occupancy rates in our hotels. All regions are pretty much showing stronger growth obviously with the exception of Baltimore, and we had some one-offs and Caesars Palace both on a whole basis and also on the baccarat business which is very sporadic and seasonal. So the VVIP players that didn't show up this year in the second quarter, I expect to show up in the back half of the year. So the median business is strong for us in the back half of the year so that\u2019s another - that will be another boost of profitability. So we expect the RevPAR and ADR to improve at least at a lot of higher level than what they did in the second quarter. Eric, please add anything else. Eric Hession : Yes, the only other thing Chad is, we do have additional visibility into a lot of the initiatives that we\u2019ve been putting in place, and as those gain traction we get more and more confident and the ability to have those deliver. As we\u2019ve discussed before, we put a number of initiatives in place and then we discount those values based on probability of success, and as those again demonstrate their ability to gain traction then we get more confidence and build them into our forecast and that\u2019s partially what you're seeing here as well. Chad Beynon : Okay great. Thank you. On the inorganic growth side, there\u2019s been a lot of headlines out there with respect to Australia and Japan lately, and I know you\u2019ve talked about Toronto, could you just update us on those key markets the opportunities and if anything else has really changed in terms of your excitement towards those markets since the last time you\u2019ve presented in a public forum? Thank you. Mark Frissora : Yes not much has changed. I think that we\u2019re continuing to be in the hunt so to speak in Japan. We feel good about our prospects there, and we continue to stay involved as required if you will through that process, and here in the Toronto and again that\u2019s a process where we are not sure when there will be a formal announcement, we continue to think our prospects are good. In terms of other activity that\u2019s going on around the world and there\u2019s a lot of things that are starting. On Brazil, we\u2019re still waiting to see that we\u2019re active there. We are waiting to see when legislation will be put in place, so that we have an opportunity to pursue their. Eric, please add anything. Eric Hession : Nothing more. Mark Frissora : Okay. Chad Beynon : Thank you both very much. Appreciate it. Best of luck. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Your line is open. John DeCree : Hi guys thanks again for the questions. Just wanted to follow-up on Chad's comment and may be digging a little deeper on the gaming volume growth that you had discussed seeing that pretty much broad-based geographically, I was wondering if you could comment on Las Vegas may be beyond and what you see on the VIP side, and then maybe regionally a little bit about what you're seeing kind of in the mid or lower tiers database? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. We - if you back out Caesars Palace and you back out Baltimore then we saw about 2% gaming growth across the enterprise. As Mark mentioned some regions where stronger than others, so we saw some traction in the Louisiana Mississippi region this quarter, which if you recall has been a challenge for us for probably the past four to five quarters. Atlantic City was also reasonably strong. The other markets in the Midwest were up a few percent to down a few percent, and then the balance of Las Vegas, again backing out Caesars Palace was also up year-over-year. So broadly speaking, we feel reasonably encouraged by the performance of the business backing out those two, kind of externalities. From a segment perspective, our spend per trip across the enterprise was up 3.5%. VIP trips were up approximately 2%, and then our VVIP trips were up about 7%. So again, pretty good performance on the side of the gaming broadly speaking and it was really just a couple of properties that were isolated in terms of the fairly large contractions. John DeCree : That's helpful thanks Eric. And taking a look at 3Q, two big fights obviously in Las Vegas, was wondering if some of the bookings that you\u2019re seeing or some of the trips being pulled forward to maybe 3Q on the VIP side or even further down the segments of customers, is this typically what you see when there is big events and anything unusual or kind of upside surprise to help 3Q is looking? Mark Frissora : Yes there is no question that having a marquee boxing or MMA or other event certainly helps our performance from an ADR perspective. When the city regardless of where the event is, draws a significant amount of people, it creates compression and we\u2019re all able to raise our rates. So, I think if you were to go look at the published rates during the Mayweather-MacGregor week fight, you would see a sizable increase relative to what they were before the fight announced. So that\u2019s very positive for us. From a higher gaming standpoint, we\u2019ll have do see in terms of what types of customers come in. Broadly speaking it does provide a positive for the quarter, but there are a lot of days and it fills up the weekend, but there are other positive aspects that are going on in the quarter that led us to have the confidence to increase our estimates. John DeCree : Great, thanks a lot guys. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Jared, the line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So just to ask that revenue question a little bit differently, if you were to sort of neutralize for all the headwinds you called out, the one-time comp noise, how much do you think revenue would have been up in the quarter and I realize some of these are hard to quantify, but I\u2019m really just trying to get some clarity on what the go forward number would look like relative to your 3% annual targets? Mark Frissora : I mean, we are seeing growth at this point anyways in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis; it\u2019s much stronger than 3%. So, I would just say that our confidence to increase the estimate and understand what\u2019s happening in the back half of the year in third quarter and fourth quarter is high given what we see what our bookings are, our understanding how that impacts gaming revenues as well, what cash business we have versus non-cash. So we have pretty good visibility for at least the next three months, and then actually when we look at meetings, schedules, and as well as kind of what we\u2019re seeing as a trend in the business, we\u2019re feeling very good year-on-year given what we did in the second half of last year. So our increase in the second half of this year will be significantly higher than what the first half was on a year-on-year basis. The best thing I could say is just significantly higher. So higher than let's say an ongoing 3% number for the second half of this year. Jared Shojaian : Okay that\u2019s really helpful, and so that - at least 3% for the third quarter and Mark did I hear you correctly in your prepared remarks, I think you said fourth quarter was going to accelerate from the third quarter year-over-year growth rate as well as that right? Mark Frissora : I don't [indiscernible] didn\u2019t see that, but so at this point I wouldn't predict that, but I mean third quarter again will be a better growth rate then what we experienced certainly in the second quarter and first quarter. Jared Shojaian : Got it. Okay. And then last one for me, can you just elaborate on some of the softness you called out for the Vegas market in the press release was that just entirely renovations related or did you see core demand softness and if so, has demand since return back to normal levels? Mark Frissora : No, I would say that in May and June, we saw that the meetings schedules were unusually light, and that drove some softness in midway demand for example in the hotel business, and obviously that also impacts our gaming revenue. We had, if you exclude Caesars Palace, we had growth of about 1.4% on gaming revenue, if you exclude Caesars Palace for This Strip. So in general it wasn't bad for a moment, we saw a slight improvement, which is always good as it relates to just the core gaming business at large. So we feel pretty good about the demand that was there. If we exclude certain kind of one-time issues, you know when you look at this baccarat issue it has a bigger impact for us on share and it was a big year-over-year decrease, and it was driven by a list of maybe 15 to 20 customers, which, you know they show-up in different intervals, and this is a very highly kind of volatile and cyclical demand pattern for these customers and so they\u2019re all planning visits with us in the second half of the year. They didn't have visits as they did in the second quarter. In fact, they didn't have visits in the second quarter of this year. So that\u2019s what drove that particular weakness. Jared Shojaian : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Farber from Credit Suisse. David your line is open. David Farber : Hi guys, how are you? Mark Frissora : Good, how are you? David Farber : Good. I wanted to touch on Las Vegas for a moment. You mentioned that in some of your prepared remarks, but you were seeing some mixed results out of the market in the second quarter, and I guess, I\u2019m curious on a couple of things. First, how do you guys see the competitive environment there, you touched on that briefly? Second, how is ADR trending on the new hotel product from where you thought it would be? And then finally if you could share with us any updated thoughts on the seven acres of undevelopable land in front of Caesars Palace that\u2019d be helpful, and then I have one follow-up. Thanks. Mark Frissora : Sure. So, I think in terms of the broad hotel performance in the market, as Mark mentioned, the May and June period was slightly weaker and that was due to the cyclical nature of the group business pulling back and a few other factors as we look towards the second half of the year though based on the bookings, we think that that\u2019s coming back and the back half of the year will be relatively strong from an ADR perspective. From a renovations perspective however, we continue to see the same $20 to $30 improvement per room night on a renovated room, it\u2019s just when the overall market is either up or down, that variant still persists, but the absolute numbers that we get in terms of the total ADR is somewhat reflective of how the market is doing. So, we continue to believe that investing in our room product is the right decision, and we continue to believe that we\u2019ll be able to drive additional ADR relative to the overall market, given the fact that the market does go up and down in terms of having certain swings. David Farber : Okay, and then just what\u2019s the latest timing expectation perhaps, you mentioned October for the combined entities, but can you just remind us, what your latest expectations are for potential refinancing opportunities that you talked about in the past either on the growth side or the service side, any remaining gaiting factors we could think about? And that\u2019s it from me, thanks. Mark Frissora : Sure. As we said in the document related to the merger and we referenced in the conference call, we\u2019d expect that this point based on all of the indications that we have from the regulators to complete getting all of the approvals by the end of September, and then now it will allow us to ultimately close the transaction in early October, and again that\u2019s based on all the information that we have at this point. From a refinancing perspective, as you referenced, we clearly believe that there\u2019s an opportunity to reduce our interest expense through refinancing of both CERP and CGP and particularly the bonds that are still priced based on when they were put in place pre-restructuring and pre - the performance of the business over the last two years. Because those are in two different companies, the timing of that has to ultimately be post emergence.  So given the step down that occurs in October - early October, our goal would be to complete that refinancing as soon as possible and save the interest expense as quickly as we can. David Farber : Make sense, very good, thanks. Mark Frissora : Thanks. Operator Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ian Zaffino from Oppenheimer. Ian, you like is open. Mark Zhang : Hi guys, this is Mark on for Ian. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up with you guys in terms of your cost savings and your efficiency initiatives, I just wanted to see if there is a any way you could help us to possibly identify and quantify some key areas that you see a lot of potential in, and if there is anything we could have in mind for dollar expectations that would be terrific. Thank you. Mark Frissora : I would say that we continue to forecast that for the rest of the year that we will improve our marketing efficiency, we\u2019ve been pretty much beating our business plan on marketing efficiency every quarter, including the second quarter. So marketing as a percent of sales from an efficiency standpoint we believe will continue to improve in the back half of the year. And the same thing will be true of our labor efficiency. So we\u2019ve got obviously a fairly large labor number of around 2.3 billion as our spend on labor as a company, and so we will do see - I think revenue per employee, gross revenue per employee continue to go up, so we will continue to have productivity from a label standpoint. We have a number of initiatives on a revenue generation that with the increased revenue that we\u2019re going to see in the third and fourth quarter, coupled with tight operating controls around in our first - the labors piece and the marketing piece, we showed again demonstrate some nice efficiency improvements for both marketing and labor. And then we've got some new technology coming on board as well. I know that we went live with Oracle on the financial ledger project and that project has so far has gone well, we would like to see the closing - the first closing, but we anticipate no hiccups there and with that project, we have significant savings so Wisconsin has to run that system roughly $12 million to $13 million a year, that now has gone down to $2.5 million a year approximately. So, again that efficiency will start ticking in as well in the third and fourth quarter. Mark Zhang : Okay got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess like is there anything, I guess like in terms of our EBITDA improvement from cost initiatives that we could think about? Mark Frissora : Well, I mean, I don't know what we\u2019ve said so far, but we had a significant number of improvements that our plan in 2011 [ph] come in the back half of the year. So we haven\u2019t given a forecast on that so I guess maybe as we give later in the quarter we maybe give some estimates on what those initiatives generate, but at this point it would be premature to do that. Eric Hession : Yes, I would add. We haven't provided any specific guidance in terms of specific dollars of initiatives. However, they are reflected in our projections that we\u2019ve provided. The improvement of $40 million over the initial projections do reflect our current estimate of those initiatives, as well as the core revenue growth in the market. Mark Zhang : Okay great, thank you guys very much. That was very helpful. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace from JP Morgan. Mike your line is open. Mike Pace : Hi thanks, good afternoon. Bunch of my questions have already been asked and answered. So, one quick one, can you just remind us, why Baltimore is being deconsolidated? So that\u2019s the first one, and then a bigger picture for Mark, I know emergence is right around the corner, are you able to participate in any M&A activity prior to that, and how quickly do you think you can be up and running on the M&A front once you emerge? That would be helpful. Mark Frissora : Again on the M&A front, you obviously, we were anticipating emergence in October and yes we are participating in - I must say M&A activity that\u2019s going on in the industry right now. So, where it makes sense. Where do that we think there is value. So, yes we\u2019re participating [indiscernible]. Our current situation is not preventing us from participating in the types of projects that we see domestically. Eric. Eric Hession : Yes that\u2019s right. Mike as you know the process of acquiring something going through the diligence and closing in the regulatory period, I would certainly extend past our target emergence date, so from that standpoint, if something is available or something that we see is interesting where we started to work on those in anticipation of emergence. To address your first question with respect to Baltimore, as you know we own 41% of the equity in Baltimore and manage the facility. It is traded under the accounting principles as variable interest entity, and as such there are certain rules that allow you to either consolidate it or require you to not-consolidate it, due to a change in the board governance rules that were negotiated at the time that the JV was put in place that those would change three years after reopened. The accounting determination is that those tie-breaker rules no longer fall in one direction and instead fall in the other direction thus requiring us to deconsolidate it. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that does not impact any cash flow to the entity, it\u2019s purely a presentation on the income statement and balance sheet, but our cash generated by the entity and the operations of the entity don't change at all. Mike Pace : Great. And if I could just follow-up, Mark or Eric on M&A, I guess just your general thoughts about the M&A marketplace domestically? I know you talked about stuff internationally earlier, but just your thoughts there, what you think about valuations and then for Eric, just on the refinancing question from earlier are there swing variables in order for you to do that other than emergence, do you need gaming commission approvals and can that happen in lockstep with an approving - any emergence plans? Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure. I\u2019ll take them in sequence. From an M&A perspective, when we look at our portfolio there are number of different targets that might make sense to us. We could either look at targets where we would improve our position in a particular market, or we could look at targets where we would get exposure and distribution of the total awards network to a market where we currently don't exist.  I think in both those cases, we have a compelling reason beyond the strategic reason of upgrading our property or distributing the total awards card, in the sense that from a financial perspective, we believe you will get an increase in revenues due to the introduction of the total awards card. And then we will also have significant synergies due to the centralized nature of our operating structure, which is becoming even more beneficial as we introduce new systems that are cloud-based. As Mark referenced, for example, the GL that\u2019s a cloud-based GL system that\u2019s put in place, our seats are basically purchased and so the inclusion of an additional property into that GL, but the marginal cost of that is almost to 0. So, as we move to more of these types of systems the ability for us to include another property into our system would improve from an efficiency perspective and thus drive even more synergies. So from that standpoint, we think that there are a number of compelling opportunities domestically that would allow us to grow our total awards database and get great financial returns right after that. With respect to your second question of the refinancing, there are some regulatory approvals that need to happen. And so we\u2019re working with our regulatory team to figure out the best timing on that. As you saw with the repricings, we closed a portion of the CERP repricing into escrow that\u2019s always an option, so that we don't take market risk.  We\u2019ll have to evaluate that versus the cost of closing certain things into escrow versus not, and evaluate how quickly we can get to market. There\u2019s no question though from our standpoint. There is an opportunity that significantly reduces our interest expense, and we recognize that we run the risk of taking interest rate risk if there is some dislocation in the market. So, we want to do it as quickly as possible, but there are certain timelines that we have to adhere to. Operator : We have run out of time, thank you for joining. Mark Frissora : Thanks everyone. Eric Hession : Thanks everybody. Operator : This concludes our presentation. You may know disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

Joyce, the floor is yours. Joyce Arpin : Thank you. Welcome to Caesars Entertainment\u2019s Third Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s press release, earnings presentation slides, and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section at caesars.com. We also furnished a copy of the press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K. Before we get underway, we produce slides two through four, include forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers and definitions for certain non-GAAP measures. The comments made during the conference call may constitute forward-looking information. This information is based on our current expectations and actual results vary materially depending on the risks and uncertainties that manifest our operations, markets, purposes, prices and other factors as discussed in our filings [inaudible]. In addition, there are just definitions of Caesars Entertainment Corporation or CEC, Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties or CERP, Caesars Growth Partners or CGP and Caesars Entertainment Operating Company or CEOC in the slides. CEOC emerged from bankruptcy on October 6. Q3 CEC results do not include CEOC but we now discuss with them as this CEOC was consolidated with CEC and provide reference to enterprise-wide results from doing so. Same-store references export [inaudible] more results from all years due to [inaudible] consolidation in August of 2017. All enterprise live figures referred to in this call will be same-store. Mark will discuss results related to our press release and the entire Caesars Enterprise and provide an update on our initiative progress. Eric will then review the financial results in detail before Mark closes. We\u2019ll then take your questions. Please turn to slide seven, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Frissora : Thank you Joyce. Caesars Entertainment reported solid financial results in the third quarter delivering on our plan to grow revenue and expand margins. As you know, we also completed the restructuring of CEOC on October 6, simplifying our business and allowing us to turn our full attention to our growth initiatives. As we anticipated and communicated on our last call, revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter. Our results were supported by increased gaming volume across the majority of our domestic properties and improved hospitality results and additional successes from business improvement projects. CEC which consists of CERP an CGP reported solid third quarter results with flat net revenues and operating income growth of a $130 million year-over-year. On a same-store basis which excludes Horseshoe Baltimore results for both years, net revenue improved $34 million or 3.8% driven by strong gaming volume improvements, improved hospitality results due to our dynamic pricing models and room renovations and operational growth initiatives. Operation income improved a $137 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 17.7% driven by revenue growth and improvement operating efficiencies. On an enterprise-wide same-store basis, net revenues increased 2.6% to $2.1 billion. Slot volume growth for our domestic revenues up $40 million. Recently completed renovation projects at Planet Hollywood, and the Palace Tower at Caesars Palace help grew Las Vegas cash ADR 4.3% over the third quarter of 2016, which improved room revenues. Same-store enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA increased 16.6% to $612 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was driven by improvement in revenue and operating cost reductions. The revenue in adjusted EBITDA growth was negatively impacted by unfavorable year-over-year hold, primarily driven by one of our London properties. Enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA margins grew 350 basis points to 29.3%. Looking ahead, we believe the results of our team achieved this quarter provide us with enough momentum to navigate through headwinds in the fourth quarter, and remain on track to meet or exceed previous guidance. Moving on to slide eight. As you all know, our hometown has been impacted by the horrific attack on October 1. We are committed to helping Las Vegas heal by operating resources of those affected, and supported the organizations who will need our ongoing assistance. Together with our employees, chefs and entertainers, we have donated a $2 million to assist those affected by this attack. Regarding our Las Vegas operations, we expect any impact to be immaterial relative to our overall enterprise adjusted EBITDAR. In addition, we do not believe the incident will have a material impact on Las Vegas visitation or on our growth opportunities in the market in the long-term. We will continue to evaluate and monitor our business, if the current trends do not deteriorate, we will expect to meet or exceed our projected 2017 enterprise EBITDA, EBITDAR of $2,245 million. Adjustments for six months of deconsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore, this figure is expected to be $2,221 million. Continuing to slide nine. CEOCs emergency \u2013 emergence from bankruptcy and the completion of the merger with CACQ will enable us to transition to a simpler operating structure. In the fourth quarter, we planned to modify our reporting segments and will shift operationally focused regional segments, which is consistent with how we manage the business. On slide 10, we highlight the new ownership structure for assets. Following the restructuring, Caesars will continue to operate all 47 properties under a consolidated approach with 18 properties subject through a long-term lease agreement with VICI. Caesars owns or manages the remaining assets and also controls all the brands, the central line services and total rewards program. All properties will continue to be part of the Caesars network and will continue to benefit from all services. Slide 11. The restructuring process resulted in substantially reduced leverage and a much improved balance sheet. Following CEOC emergence, Caesars Entertainment has approximately $2 billion in cash. We\u2019ve also taken additional steps to improve cash flow by opportunistically financing outstanding debt. The pro forma result of our refinancing for CERP, CGPH and Baltimore totaled $270 million of annual interest savings. This amount plus $20 million of annual interest savings from the recent Harrah\u2019s Philadelphia refinancing, pending regulatory approval brings out total enterprise-wide annual savings to $290 million. These savings combined with the impact of a reduced debt, will result in an annual reduction and fixed charges at approximately $1.6 billion versus 2014. Our branded cost of debt is expected to be approximately 4.5%. On slide 12, we highlight our four cornerstone initiatives. We made important progress on each of these initiatives in the quarter, as I\u2019ll highlight in the following slides. Slide 13. Last week we announced the appointment of Chris Holdren as our Chief Marketing Officer. Chris has deep marketing experience in the entertainment and hospitality industries as well as tech company experiences making him exceptionally qualified to continue the moment behind a revolving data driven marketing strategies. Chris spends 15 years at Starwood Hotels & Resorts and a variety of senior marketing roles including overseeing the SPG Loyalty program completed several years in Creative Content Development at the Walt Disney Company and most recently served as the CMO of Handy. Chris will play an instrumental role driving continued enhancements in our marketing programs, notably by leveraging the unravel quality and quantity of data in our total rewards database and our new technology platforms. These will allow us to directly deliver timely, personalized offers to customers and increase engagement, while ensuring we generate appropriate returns. As stated previously, we have improved marketing efficiency over the past three quarters, our objective and one of Chris\u2019s main focuses going forward is to continue to improve marketing as a percent of sales. Slide 14. We\u2019re also making progress on planned upgrades of our technology systems. This quarter we successfully closed our first quarter in Oracle\u2019s financial cloud solution which is at a lower cost and allows to eliminate many manual processes in our accounting department, giving significant productivity gains. We are proud of the team\u2019s effects and achieving this milestone, and we look forward to celebrating our milestones in the coming quarters across the company with the introduction of Office 365 and our new partnership with ADP for payroll and attendance. Slide 15. At the code, everything we do is a relentless focus on maintaining the highest levels of employee and customer satisfaction. I\u2019m pleased to report that our efforts are paying off. We were recently recognized by TripAdvisor with 25 individual certificate of excellence awards across our properties, nearly double the number of awards we won last year. Caesars Palace and the Cromwell also ranked among the top US casinos by USA Today, and we won Company of the Year North America for the employee engagement awards. We\u2019re also won three prestigious loyalty 360 awards in the category of loyalty and advocacy, operational excellence and organizational commitment. We were nominated for the most awards in any participating company with a field that includes impressive brands like Wyndham, the MGM Resorts and Dominos among others. These excellent results are key driver of our success and I want to thank the Caesars team for continuing to go above and beyond to take care of guests. I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail now. Eric Hession : Thanks, Mark. Today I\u2019ll focus the commentary on enterprise-wide same-store results unless otherwise indicated. Enterprise-wide results included CEC plus CEOC and same-store results exclude the Horseshoe Baltimore which we deconsolidated at the end of August, and now will be reflected as an investment through the equity metric. CEC and entity level results can be viewed in the earnings release, the Form10-Q and in the appendix at the back of the earnings deck. Now please turn your attention to slide 17. Enterprise-wide same-store net revenues rose 2.6% year-over-year. Slot volume improvements of 4% year-over-year offset highly unfavorable hold at one of our London properties. Caesars Palace led the enterprise in overall dollar value revenue improvement, exceeding prior year by approximately $15 million. The Gulf Coast region continues to show signs of stability, generating a 6.9% year-over-year increase in net revenue. In addition to the gaming growth that Mark discussed earlier, improved cash ADR and cash resort fees as well as an improvement in bankrupt revenues also contributed to the increase. Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% or $87 million supported by higher revenues and reduced operating expenses. The improvements in revenues and reductions and expenses were partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year hold impact between $10 million and $15 million. Third quarter of hold impact on operating income was unfavorable to our expectations by between $20 million and $25 million. On a same-store basis, hold adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between $632 million and $637 million, with the hold adjusted margin of between 29.7% and 30%. We face challenging year-over-year headwinds as we look into the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Horseshoe Baltimore contributed approximately $80 million of net revenue and $14 million of adjusted EBITDA. And as discussed previously, it\u2019s results will not be consolidated during this year\u2019s fourth quarter. In addition, CEOC reported a onetime fee revenue pickup also in the fourth quarter of last year of $83.5 million related to our exit from our Ohio properties. While the fee pickup did not count towards our EBITDA results, it will be a revenue headwind for future comparisons. Finally, in Q4 of 2016, we also experience hold that was favorable to our expectations in an estimated range of between $15 million and $20 million with all of it coming from the Las Vegas region. It\u2019s likely that our revenues for the fourth quarter will be affected by the recent tragic events in Las Vegas. We also expect some temporary corporate cost pressures as we continue implementations of Major IT infrastructure. As always, we remained focused on cost control and continuous improvement initiatives which we will use to help offset these anticipated increases and headwinds. We anticipated that the construction impact from the room renovation projects we have underway will be flat year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds and as Mark stated earlier, we remain on track to meet or exceed our previously guided 2017 same-store adjusted EBITDAR of $2.221 billion. Moving to slide 18, we outline our cash positions by entity as of September 30 of this year. Post to margins, we will have approximately $2 billion of cash enterprise-wide and are now well positioned to invest in incremental growth opportunities. Our same-store capital spending is at its peak in 2017 with a high range estimate of $670 million as we continue to progress on our room renovation plans. Our capital expending estimates do not include any inorganic projects such as M&A or the development of the unused acreage we own on the Las Vegas trip. Well the 6,000 rooms we are renovating across the enterprise this year, about 4,500 of them are here in Las Vegas. By the end of the year, just under 1,200 of our Las Vegas rooms are approximately 50% well have been renovated since 2014. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mark for his closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Eric. Please turn to slide 20. So to recap, as anticipated, year-on-year performance accelerated and we had an exceptional third quarter, which included enterprise-wide all time record third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins. We\u2019re also going to make headway on our cornerstone initiatives. With CEOCs restructuring now concluded, we are well positioned to pursue a more diversified growth strategy while continuing to invest in our core business. So we\u2019ll now open up the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Chad Beynon. Chad Beynon : Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Wanted to start with the, the exceptional margins in the third quarter mainly in CEOC. Last week at the investor event you spent a lot of time really talking about continuous improvement and some of the initiatives that you better in place, but we thought we\u2019re going to get a lot of that in 2018 not this quarter. So could you kind of just talk about, if there was, if there were any one time or if it was just a good mix of where the revenues were coming from? You called out a $15 million benefit or growth at Caesars Palace, maybe just some color around, was the margin growth broad based with CEOC or was it really at Caesars Palace, any color there would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up, thanks. Mark Frissora : Yeah, Eric and I both answered this. But in general it was broad based, and I think that we had obviously a good quarter in spite of the bad hold that\u2019s one of the things that we tried to point in our remarks. So it wasn\u2019t a good hold from a planning standpoint we\u2019re off about $20 million, $25 million from or plan. And so, so yeah, we felt pretty good about it and I would say that, slot volume growth was one of the key drivers as we continue to see a lot of that growth. We had a really good, I would call hospitality finish as well. So, a couple of highlights there Eric? Eric Hession : Yeah, the only thing I\u2019d add Mark is that, as we\u2019ve discussed, we do operate a relatively fixed cost business and we make a conscious effort to really try to control our costs as we go through the quarter. And so in a quarter where we had increased revenues as Mark referenced on the slot side, and also increased revenues on the hotel side, we were able to drop significant portion of that for the bottom line and the end result was a improved margin performance. And as we noted at the Investor Day last week, and as we\u2019ve said consistently on the conference calls, moving forward we\u2019ll continue to offset the inflationary pressures that we see and then do expect to continue to improve our margins. Chad Beynon : Okay, great. My follow-up is with respect to the new legislation in Pennsylvania, a number of different bullet points within that piece of legislation. I was wondering if you could give us your views on how you think about the bill and if you would pursue some of the opportunities that were outlined within that? Mark Frissora : And I think from a broad based standpoint, I\u2019m sorry Eric, let me catch up. I think we have a \u2013 it\u2019s a lot of mixed things there, I mean there is not \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is any clear answer to say that its net positive. I think we\u2019re kind of neutral given the things that we\u2019ve seen it, there were some good things and there were some things that are not so good in terms of the capacity and what kind of added capacity as the market [inaudible] has an impact on existing infrastructure. Eric? Eric Hession : Yeah, I think that\u2019s right Mark. It\u2019s great that internet gaming was passed, so we\u2019re excited about that. Tax rate was very much on the high side but it did impact so that was something that we\u2019d be hoping for long time. And we\u2019ll have to evaluate the package and its entirety before we make a conclusive statement one way or the other. Chad Beynon : Okay, great. Congrats on the quarter guys. Mark Frissora : Thanks. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Farber. David Farber : Hey guys, how are you? Mark Frissora : Hi. Eric Hession : Hey David. David Farber : Hi, that\u2019s a new name for me. I guess\u2026 Mark Frissora : We like it with all smiles. David Farber : Good. I wanted to touch on your desire to use the brand and perhaps M&A to grow the asset base you\u2019ve touched upon that a bunch recently. But I guess I was curious if you could touch on any disposition strategy you might have, if you thought about that at all and I had a follow-up question. Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yeah, I mean we certainly have had time to think about it in bankruptcy and, and so yeah, there is our several facilities that may make sense at some point to judder some, obviously those that are lower performing without good macros. Our plans is kind of if we get a range perfectly we would try to grow through M&A type activity, development activity at the same time that we would actually exit some of those properties. We have a new board now and we\u2019ve been talking to them about our plans of those facilities that may make sense for us to exit and those that it might make sense to buy obviously. So, but we\u2019d like to do it in such a way that you really don\u2019t see the impact on the revenue line. Eric? Eric Hession : Yeah [inaudible]. Mark Frissora : Okay. David Farber : And my follow-up \u2013 and thanks for that. My follow-up is just, maybe you can help us a little bit understand given the experience you\u2019ve had with the Caesars branded, I\u2019m curious if you think about future partnerships with other gaming REITs if you think that\u2019s likely in your mind and maybe just sort of how you think about the REIT universe and things you might have with the VICI. And that\u2019s it from me, thanks. Eric Hession : Sure. So, yeah, the question regarding the VICI relationship and the other REITs is certainly something that we\u2019ve been asked a few times. Right now we have a very good relationship with VICI. We\u2019re obviously their largest and only tenant at this point. Going forward, we have relationship contractually basis where we will have a ROFO between any non-Las Vegas acquisition or development opportunity with them, and a similar back to us if they go and acquire anything. So from that standpoint, I think working with them and those opportunities make sense. That\u2019s said, if they\u2019re not competitive from the cost to capital perspective, then we\u2019re certainly able to work with others or be able to rely on our own balance sheet and our own abilities to finance certain transaction. So, going forward, we\u2019ll look at all available possibilities and make the best decision based on the facts as they present themselves. David Farber : Very good, and thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace. Mike Pace : Hi, thanks. One structural and a follow-up. So, Eric, I wonder if you can, with the ability and timing that you have to redeem your legacy [inaudible] CGPH bonds, you\u2019re not carrying 2x the amount of debt but you need to and what steps have to happen to get there and when should we expect that? And is the goal at some point in 2018 to consider further simplifying the silos with the CEOC and CRC and [inaudible] will try that decision. Thanks. Eric Hession : Sure. So, as you\u2019re aware and everybody on the phone I believe as well, we did secure the financing for CRC, those bonds are currently in escrow and they\u2019re waiting the final steps of approval that we need which is regulatory at this point. That we needed approval in three states New Jersey, Nevada and Louisiana. We believe that at this point will beyond schedules so that we\u2019re able to close the transaction in November but that can certainly slip based on the variety of schedules. So, we think November to December is the likely time for that to come out of escrow and to ultimately close the financing. Regarding the comment on CEOC, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to evaluate as we go forward, and make an overall cost to capital perspective. I think further simplification would ultimately make sense and we\u2019ll have to evaluate as we go forward and make an overall cost to capital perspective. I think further simplification would ultimately make sense and we\u2019ll have to evaluate what the market conditions are, and the cost or benefit financially of emerging that entity into CRC but that\u2019s something that could happen in 2018. Mike Pace : And then just what the follow-up is, I noted a comment in the press release that in the fourth quarter your reporting segments will shift to I guess you\u2019ve sent operationally focused or regionally. Can you just explain that a little bit more? Eric Hession : Sure. We currently report based on credits as you\u2019re aware with certain CGPH, CEOC, etcetera. And now that we\u2019re out of restructuring and have a different capital structure, we feel that it\u2019s more appropriate to report based on regions which is generally more consistent with how we manage the business. And so we\u2019ll have three regions going forward, we\u2019ll have the Las Vegas region, we\u2019ll have the other region and the one of an international region. And so we think that\u2019ll be more useful for when you\u2019re comping against competitors and when you\u2019re looking at the business and trying to evaluate the performance in the different areas. Mike Pace : Great, thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Mark and Eric, you both provided some helpful color on Las Vegas specifically in kind of the recent impact. When you think about the fourth quarter overall and obviously Eric, you mentioned the $15 million to $20 million of hold headwinds but do you believe there is a trajectory to EBITDA growth given everything that\u2019s going on as well as a hold headwind and some of the initiatives in the momentum that you mentioned within Las Vegas specifically in the 4Q? Eric Hession : Yeah. We think that based on what we\u2019re seeing in the business and the trajectory that we have that borrowing no further downward deviation from that, that we\u2019ll still be able to achieve the projections that we had provided and be able to come in on those numbers despite the declines that we\u2019ve seen after the tragedy. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And I think I guess it was last week now at your Analyst Day you guys kind of talked about a steady improvement from kind of the first few days there. I\u2019m assuming that that trend has more or less continued with respect to bookings and pace? Eric Hession : Yeah that\u2019s correct. Again it\u2019s still, at the point where we\u2019re evaluating it continually we\u2019re looking at the various paces for the different groups and the different segments including New Years and trying to estimate what the ultimate impact is going to be. But again, consistent with what we said there, the pace of the variance in bookings and cancellations has certainly declined. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thanks a lot Eric. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John DeCree. John DeCree : Hey everyone, thanks for the question. Just one for me, wanted to go back to your commentary on the slot volumes and that being a big driver of your revenues this quarter. And I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color, I mean in Las Vegas specifically we saw a couple of consecutive months now of pretty good slot volume growth. And was wondering if you guys had a view as to what, what might be driving it, is it kind of how you\u2019re marking the business or slot product on the floor, any color you have on what might be behind that would be helpful. Eric Hession : Yeah, sure, I\u2019ll take them first up and see if Mark wants to add anything else. Yeah, the slot volumes that we\u2019ve seen as well in Las Vegas have certainly been on the stronger side for a number of months now. I would also add that that\u2019s consistent through the regional properties as well, as you saw our overall slots were up 4% which is some of the strongest growth we\u2019ve had in a very long time. In terms of what\u2019s driving that, we believe in a combination of things. Certainly our marketing efforts come into play as we refine and pull back on the marketing spend, we think that that\u2019s translating into better ability to target certain customers and ultimately resulting in improved slot volumes. But I\u2019d also have to say that the new units that we put on the floor in terms of the product seem to be resonating very well with the customers. And so I think that might have some of it to contribute as well. And then as you\u2019ve seen from us and in the LVCVA statistics, the third quarter is generally a very strong quarter for the Las Vegas market. And as a result, we were able to charge higher rates for our hotel rooms and our gaming customers in order to get the complementary rooms, had to be at a higher status. So our VIP and VVIP trips were up 4% in the quarter on the year-over-year basis, so that translates directly into additional slots spend. Mark Frissora : Yeah, and I would add that. All those things that were mentioned, it\u2019s kind of equal across the board. I don\u2019t know if we can say it\u2019s one thing or the other. I do know that on the slot product refresh that we\u2019ve done this year, it impacts I think roughly and correct me if I\u2019m wrong Eric, something like 10% to 15% of our slot product. So it\u2019s not like it\u2019s replacing all of our slot product and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it, I want to make sure you understand it\u2019s \u2013 it is for the product we have for them for us to perform really, really well. John DeCree : Understood, that\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up housekeeping item, maybe Eric for you, you and Mark both kind of commented on 2017 projections. I was wondering if you guys had contemplated whether you would kind of update or when the time is appropriate on some of the 2018 projections that you guys had given as you emerged from bankruptcy. And that\u2019s all from me, thanks. Eric Hession : Yeah, at this time we\u2019re not providing an update to 2018 projections. We\u2019ll evaluate whether we do that at a future time and we\u2019ll likely also provide projections for our CapEx spend at that time. John DeCree : Thanks, Eric. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ian Zaffino. Ian Zaffino : Okay, great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to kind of build on the little bit, bit of the rejections. Mark, I know you have mentioned that 2017 should at least meet or beat, but I would have figured with the quarter maybe you would have led more to beating 2017. And I\u2019m shock at sense, is it just the maybe a pull forward of some the spending that you have planned in 2018 that you\u2019re doing now in 2017? Maybe you should give us some color there, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yeah, I mean obviously we give you the best estimate we can every single time we come up and talk about, what the businesses are doing. So I think that in terms of pulling forward anything, there was nothing pulled forward at all, so we weren\u2019t even thinking about that. So, I think we have a business plan that we\u2019ve kind of come set on for next year, we kind of know what the primary drivers will be of our improvement in our business plan for next year, but not ready at this point, we hadn\u2019t even talked to the board, we have to get board approval of our plan. And once we feel more solid about Vegas making sure that this doesn\u2019t have a long-term impact obviously, the tragedy, we\u2019ll obviously provide as much guidance as we can. Ian Zaffino : Okay. Eric Hession : And the only thing I\u2019d add, Ian, we always try to make sure that the expectations that we set our expectations that we as a team feel confident that we\u2019re able to meet and exceed. And so, as we head into the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t want to provide projections that we would have risk at missing. Ian Zaffino : No, I get it. And then also, Eric, I think we talked about the capital deployment a little bit, but how are you thinking about it, because you\u2019re sitting on some good cash, have a lot of cash flow. And I know you\u2019ve mentioned before that there were some M&A opportunities that you wanted to do while you\u2019re in bankruptcy that are still available to you. But how do you think about this, I mean what sort of the timing or maybe the size, and how does that really foot with what you\u2019re trying to do as far as building out that real estate and monetizing that as well? Eric Hession : Sure. Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been out of bankruptcy for less than a month, so, yeah, we have no deal to announce yet. But we\u2019re actively working on it. As we mentioned, it\u2019s certainly core to our strategy is to look for opportunities domestically and those could be tuck in acquisitions of a variety of size but it would be from a strategic attempts to distribute the total [inaudible] more. And also on the particular acquisition it would be from a getting a great return on that particular investment. So I would say that we\u2019re very active, we\u2019re out looking for opportunities, we\u2019ll have to be disciplined and make sure that they fit with the strategy, but it\u2019s certainly something that in 2018 we would actively expect to complete a number of transactions. I\u2019d also say that we\u2019ve mentioned previously our intends to work on a corporate centre on the east side land, subject to a variety of approvals that\u2019s something that the management team really would like to do. And that takes time also to ramp up in terms of getting the permits, getting the approvals, working out the land [inaudible]. So those were the things that we\u2019re pursuing right now. And you\u2019re right, we have a significant amount of cash, we\u2019re generating a lot of cash and from a capital allocation perspective, we\u2019ll be reinvesting in the business, we\u2019ll be growing the footprint, and then we\u2019ll also be expanding and building on our land here in Las Vegas that we have vacant and available. Ian Zaffino : All right, great. That\u2019s really helpful, so thank you again for the answers, and good color. Thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Robin Farley. Robin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about your Vegas, what is your mix of convention rooms this year versus last year, just wondering how that is trending? Thanks. Eric Hession : We\u2019re right now at about 25% convention mix, and that\u2019s about the same maybe slightly higher than last year. Robin Farley : And do you have a view on how 2018 may look for that? Eric Hession : Yeah, our pace is reasonably strong. We generally look at it from more on the revenue side because that includes both the banks and hotel component. But when we look at both the one year and the two year pace, we\u2019re up mid-single digits versus prior year pacing, so we think that\u2019s relatively solid and a good indicator of consistent growth within the market in that segment. Robin Farley : Okay, great, thanks. And maybe just one other clarification, I know there were couple of questions earlier about how things have been shaping up in the last few weeks. Is there, I guess what is your expectation maybe for where occupancy will come in, in the fourth quarter overall in Vegas? Eric Hession : Generally, our occupancies are very solid here and they don\u2019t vary much. What varies more is the rate. I would expect that our occupancies in Las Vegas will be within a couple of hundred basis points of where they were prior year. I think if you\u2019re going to see much of a variance that\u2019ll be on the rate side. And so I wouldn\u2019t expect a huge change in our occupancy of anything more than a couple of hundred basis points. Robin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes. Patrick Scholes : Yeah, good evening. I\u2019m wondering if you can discuss a bit on performance of the various tiers in your database during the quarter. Thank you. Eric Hession : The tiers meaning the work groups? Patrick Scholes : No, I mean various customer segments whether high-end, middle, lower also drive to or fly end. How do they perform versus your expectations, anything to note in there? Eric Hession : Yeah, I guess I\u2019ll make a couple of comments that, I mentioned that our VIP and VVIP trips were up solidly for the quarterly, up 4.1% on a year-over-year basis. The spend for trip on the VVIP segment however was down. As we\u2019ve mentioned some of the international play that we had during the quarter as down as well as the hold effect that we had, that occurred obviously from that particular segment. From an overall perspective, when you look at the entire company, our spend for trip though was up 4.5%, so it was really isolated to those few customers at the VVIP level. In terms of the fly end versus the drive-in traffic, we don\u2019t usually segment it that way and really kind of look at it just based on the demand coming into Las Vegas. And as we mentioned, we felt it was a very strong quarter for both the drive-in and the fly end, RevPAR was up approximately 5% here in Las Vegas so it was a good quarter for that and that contributed a lot of the flow through that we saw in the quarter. Patrick Scholes : Okay, thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of [inaudible]. Unidentified Participant : Hey everybody, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask you about the revenue environment. Can you just talk about how revenue progressed throughout the quarter and then just sort of what you\u2019re seeing in Vegas and regional markets and then international? Eric Hession : Sure. So, yeah, we don\u2019t usually break it down by the months. There is certainly volatility between the months which is really why, why we generally do that. If you have a weekend that could shift or a holiday that could shift something like that or in this case, we did have to fight at the beginning of the quarter that probably impacted the end of the second quarter. But overall, we mentioned Las Vegas was strong both on the core slot and gaming side and on the hotel side. The regional markets also had a very good quarter, particularly relative to the trends that we\u2019ve been seeing for probably the last kind of five years. From an international perspective as you know, it\u2019s not as big component of our business as it is with some of our peers, but we did have the negative hold for the quarter. That\u2019s said, we are experiencing some very strong volume growth, particularly in our London properties and we just played unlucky for the quarter. Unidentified Participant : Okay. And then I guess just switching gears here. As the product has gotten better obviously with the renovation, do you see opportunity to drive your promotional allowances down? I think you comp a bit more than some of your competitors, so just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that and when we can start to see some of that happen? Eric Hession : Yeah, we\u2019ve taken a big reduction in our marketing expenses since 2014. They were down about $250 million, a lot of that was in Las Vegas, we significantly reduced our marketing here but we also did it in the regional properties. And as we\u2019ve indicated before, we believe that that\u2019s the right decision and we\u2019ll continue to press on that and continue to make efforts to reduce our marketing throughout the enterprise as we move forward. But the promotional allowance relative to our competitors, I think will generally be higher even in future years, and that\u2019s because of the fact that we have the total awards database, and it really does feed valuable customers into our Las Vegas market. Our \u2013 as rates rise, we certainly do require gaming customers that otherwise would have received a free room to start paying a portion of that or pay the entire thing, but there is still going to be a large portion of our customers that are deserving out of free room and we\u2019ll want those customers to stay with us because it is a higher return investment for us than selling the room for cash. And as a result, I think you will continue to see a higher mix in our casinos of gaming customers. And as a result, you\u2019ll see a higher promotional allowance which is effectively the amount of comp rooms that we give out here in Las Vegas. Unidentified Participant : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis. Harry Curtis : Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to clarify the comment on the hold impact. Was that primarily in London that impacted or led to the \u2013 I think you mentioned around $20 million to $25 million net-net. Mark Frissora : Well no, I guess, what I said was against our plan, we had planned to do actually better than we did last year on hold. And then the primary, one of the primary drivers, I mean there were several drivers but one of the primary one was definitely at London. So we get a lot of high [inaudible] facility there and that\u2019s where we get most of our high [inaudible] and quite a bit of that during the quarter. Harry Curtis : Okay. And then my second question, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the cadence of your expense growth and then reduction which occurred in the third quarter. Through the first half your expenses were up nearly $60 million and then they came down roughly $34 million in the third quarter. What was the \u2013 what were the primary drivers behind that pretty nice change? Eric Hession : I don\u2019t know the answer to that Harry, are you talking like our corporate expenses or just our expenses in aggregate\u2026 Harry Curtis : It\u2019s really aggregate, there are really aggregate expenses. What I did was I just did the simple math of backing off your EBITDA from your revenues, and it was \u2013 and I\u2019m just wondering if there were any programs that that kicked in the fourth quarter that had a pretty nice impact, and so I\u2019m just wondering if there was a timing issue. Mark Frissora : I think that, no, I would say if anything starting in April, we started getting incremental expenses on marketing started to do with our sales force initiatives. And that, was offset by the productivity things that we had in marketing. But in the first half, we look at labor expense and we look at marketing expense, we were right, actually better than plan and pretty much it was pretty tightly run. And third quarter again good labor productivity, marketing was pretty much flat which was part of the plan. So we felt the third quarter was, if anything from those two areas which represent close to, I would say $4.4 billion of the total spend that we have in the company. They were pretty good in the first half and in the third quarter, good but as not good as maybe in the \u2013 as it was in the first six months. So this must be something, we\u2019ll investigate this and maybe something related to expense even with the bankruptcy, I don\u2019t know, we had to look at it. Eric Hession : Yeah, there is also going to be seasonality. So, in the second quarter you\u2019ve got Atlantic City that that\u2019s their up quarter and it trickles into the third quarter, so a disproportion of our spend would shift over there versus the other periods of the year, so that could have something to do with it as well. Harry Curtis : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I just wanted to maybe try and clarify the implication of the fourth quarter performance versus the third quarter. It sounds like your commentary about the year being at or above guidance implies that that the outperformance in the third quarter could be essentially given back in the fourth quarter because of the terror event in Vegas, is that the right way of characterizing it with a little bit of potential upside? Eric Hession : I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d necessarily characterize it that way. We, up to our guidance at the end of the second quarter and we made a full year kind of projection at that point and we\u2019re sticking with that projection and giving indications that we can beat it. We did up at twice before then. There were definitely some headwinds associated with the terrorist or the attack, but at this point, we just feel like it\u2019s prudent to stick with the guidance that we had and deliver a quarter in the fourth quarter that needs or exceeds it. Harry Curtis : Okay, very good. Thanks very much. Operator : And we have run out of time for questions. Would you like to put us any other remarks? Mark Frissora : Well, thank you for attending the call. We appreciate the interest in the company and look forward to our \u2013 giving you a good report on our next earnings call. Good bye. Operator : And thanks for joining us today. This does conclude our broadcast. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

My name is Jen and I'll be your web event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. We\u2019ll be taking questions over the phone during today\u2019s presentation and you\u2019ll receive instructions on how to ask a question at the appropriate time. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Joyce Arpin, Vice President of Finance and Assistant Treasurer. Joyce, the floor is yours. Joyce Arpin : Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of our press release, earnings presentation slides, and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section on our website at caesars.com. Also please note that prior to this call, we also furnished a copy of this afternoon\u2019s press release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and we\u2019ll file our 2017 Form 10-K later today.  Before we get underway, I would like to remind you to reference slides two through four, which include forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers and defines certain non-GAAP measures. In addition, as you are likely aware, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, or CEOC, emerged from bankruptcy on October 6 and Caesars Entertainment Corporation completed its merger with Caesars Acquisition Company or CAC on that date. We also deconsolidated the results of Horseshoe Baltimore last quarter, and exited a management relationship with certain properties in Ohio in 2016. Therefore, our US GAAP results include CEOC only after October 6 and includes CAC in all periods. Same-store includes CEOC during all periods, but also exclude the Horseshoe Baltimore and Ohio managed properties, including the one-time termination fee received in December of 2016. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP figures on Slides 19 through 27.  I will now turn the call over to Mark, so please turn to slide 6. Mark Frissora : Thank you Joyce. Turning to slide 6, I\u2019m pleased to report that Caesars Entertainment delivered another year of solid operating performance with growth across all segments versus 2016. Over the course of 2017, we successfully delivered against key parts of our strategy. We enhanced our loyalty program through new offerings in our mobile platforms. We continued to invest in our room product, with more than 50% of our five year renovation plan now finished. We also made further improvements to our efficient operating model. And following the completion of CEOC\u2019s restructuring, we announced three strategic transactions. For the full year, net revenues, operating income, and adjusted EBITDAR increased significantly year over year since CEOC\u2019s results are not included in 2016 and start on October 6 for the 2017 period. From a same-store perspective, net increase - net revenues increased 1% year over year to $8.1 billion, and $84 million increase in gaming was driven by strong regional performance and steady Las Vegas slot volume growth. However, this was offset by unfavorable hold for a second consecutive year, which impacted our same-store revenues and income from operations by $80 million and $65 million respectively. Non-gaming revenues increased to $59 million, driven by improved rates from additional renovated rooms and overall strength in hospitality management. Las Vegas RevPAR improved 3.9% to $132 million for the full year 2017, so $132 for the full year 2017, and that exceeded the Las Vegas strip market RevPAR growth of approximately 2%. Same-store adjusted EBITDAR expanded 3% year over year to $2.2 billion, surpassing the 2017 estimate that we discussed on our last quarterly call, and we achieve the highest full year EBITDAR margins in over a decade, with an expansion of 60 basis points to 27.1%. On a hold adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDAR of $2.24 billion was up 6.2% year over year. These achievements reflect the ongoing success of our continuous improvement efforts, which supported significant increases in both gaming and non-gaming revenues, and provided excellent flow through due to our cost control efforts. On Slide seven, our fourth quarter results are summarized. For the fourth quarter, we delivered same-store net revenues of $1.96 billion and adjusted EBITDAR of $505 million, both in line with the prior year quarter. Eric will provide some more detailed information on the fourth quarter, but I do want to point out a few items. The tragedy that occurred in Las Vegas on October 1 impacted our EBITDAR by approximately $25 million in the quarter. Hold had an unfavorable effect on revenue and adjusted EBITDAR versus the prior year quarter, which was primarily driven by VVIP baccarat play at Caesars Palace. Adjusted EBITDAR would have been up 11% excluding the impact from the October 1 tragedy and the unfavorable hold. It\u2019s important to remember that our hold results can vary widely from quarter to quarter based on high roller activity in the period, which has an outsized impact on gaming revenues. VVIP players make up an important customer segment for us, and drive significant profits in periods where we see favorable hold. So far in the first quarter, we are seeing a large volume of international play. However, today hold continues to be unfavorable year over year. Turning to Slide 8, we wanted to point out some components driving net income and EPS. We also outlined a few key components that should help investors better understand our balance sheet and income statement. In a failed sale leaseback transaction where cash is exchanged, the operating company simply recognizes a liability on its balance sheet equal to the cash paid and the assets remain on the books at their historical net book value. This is consistent with our treatment of our sale of the real estate property of Harrah's Las Vegas. In the unique case of CEOC's emergence and purchased by CEC, the non-cash transfer of the real estate resulted in the finance obligation equating to the fair value of the assets as subscribed to them by VICI. The increase to the real estate value of $3.5 billion from the revaluation results in incremental depreciation and interest expense that exceeds the lease payments. This quarter, our net income was reduced by $145 million of non-cash interest and depreciation associated with the fair value adjustment unique to these assets.  On the next slide, I\u2019d like to highlight our new cornerstone initiative for 2018. First, we remain focused on invigorating our hospitality and loyalty marketing programs. We increased the number of Total Rewards members by 3.4% to a total of 55 million members, and we plan to drive the further growth of our TR database and greater adoption of our TR app and TR Visa cards in 2018. Second, in 2018 we will enhance our gaming offerings. We\u2019ll invest in new gaming products, eSports tournaments, including events hosted at the new eSports lounge we recently opened at the Rio, and upgrades and new features for the TR app that will create a highly personalized gamified experiences for members. Items such as achievements to unlock status levels and other features and promotions are expected to be launched during the year, and will update in real time to create a sense of competition and excitement, both on and off our properties. More to come on progress with this initiative. As I mentioned, our continuous improvement focused operating model, helped us achieve our highest full year EBITDAR margins in over a decade. We established the office of continuous improvement to centrally oversee our various initiatives, and scale the successful ones across the organization. Our third cornerstone initiative for 2018 is focused on this continuous improvement, and we expect to see benefits from these efforts as we execute hundreds of initiatives to improve efficiency and increase revenue across the organization. And we will continue to evaluate and upgrade our technology. In February, we rolled out Oracle's human capital management system, which boosts our cloud first strategy. Finally, we are shifting our focus towards driving the expansion of our distribution network beyond investment in our existing infrastructure. I\u2019ll go into more detail on this cornerstone as we made progress with the recently announced acquisition of Centaur Gaming and our plan to expand our Las Vegas footprint with the development of a new conference center in the center of the strip. On Slide 10, I'd like to highlight our strong performance in food and beverage, and the ongoing expansion of our celebrity chef concepts. I'm proud to announce that the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace generated sales of $53 million in 2017, which I\u2019d like to point out is higher than the top grossing US restaurant as ranked by Business Insider. In the first quarter, we opened the world's first Hell's Kitchen Restaurant in partnership with Gordon Ramsay. And we opened a new concept, Pronto by Giada De Laurentiis in Las Vegas in the first quarter, which is also off to a great start. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to highlight the acquisition of Centaur Gaming, including the Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand horseracing and gaming destinations, in addition to three off-track betting locations in Indiana. These properties are strategically located in areas with low gaming penetration and strong economic indicators, and are complementary to the existing Caesars portfolio and will directly support our Total Rewards distribution strategy. Both properties were recently built or renovated and include world class horseracing operations, in addition to 4,000 of the latest slots electronic table games.  We expect the deployment of Total Rewards, introduction of our brands and the implementation of our efficient operating model to drive accelerated performance. In January, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart\u2013Scott\u2013Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and we expect to receive full regulatory approval and close the acquisition during the second quarter of 2018. As we stated earlier, we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of Harrah's Las Vegas and cash on hand plus debt to fund the purchase. This could include the issuance of new debt in the form of a revolver draw, incremental term loans or new bonds. Turning to Slide 12, we also recently announced a transaction to sell and lease back the real estate assets associated with Harrah's Las Vegas to VICI Properties, and to acquire adjacent land from VICI to develop the new Caesars Forum Convention Center, which will have 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space. This transaction allows us to unlock Harrah\u2019s real estate value, while keeping it in the Caesars network, financing the Centaur acquisition without increasing our balance sheet leverage and invest in expanding our center strip footprint with the addition of a new Caesars Forum Convention Center.  Caesars Forum will be located near Harrah's and the LINQ, which are two properties with the lowest ratio of meeting space to hotel rooms in our Los Vegas portfolio. The facility will include flexible meeting space focused around business meetings, and will feature the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, with a unique outdoor 100,000 square foot event plaza, unlike anything currently offered in Las Vegas. We're investing approximately $375 million in development of Caesars Forum and expect to generate substantial incremental revenue. We anticipate breaking ground in early Q2 2018, with a two year construction period. As, we're also actively pursuing international development opportunities as part of our diversified growth strategy. We broke ground for site of our new resort in Incheon, Korea last year and anticipate making more progress on this front in 2018. Our network expansion plan is off to a great start with these strategic transactions, and we remain in a strong financial position with solid cash flows to pursue other opportunities with attractive returns. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Eric to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll start with our quarterly same-store segment results, followed by a review of the company's liquidity position and debt structure. I\u2019ll then conclude with some notable items for Q1 2018, before turning it back to Mark for some comments. Starting with Slide 14, please note that my commentary today will cover same-store results unless otherwise stated. Same-store includes CEOC results and excludes the Horseshoe Baltimore and the Ohio property impacts from all periods. Accordingly, same-store net revenues were essentially flat at $1.96 billion for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA results exceeded our expectations, supported by reductions in regional marketing and operating expenses, as well as continuous improvement in regional gaming revenues that largely offset unfavorable hold in Las Vegas. Hold had an unfavorable effect on operating income of about $10 million to $15 million in the quarter, relative to our expected hold of between $30 million and $35 million when compared to the prior year period. The hold volatility was isolated primarily in baccarat play at Caesars Palace in both years. We were pleased that Las Vegas slot volumes continued the trends from prior year periods and had a record fourth quarter, increasing 1.7% over the prior year on a city wide basis, and 2.5% for the full year. Las Vegas RevPAR and occupancy were relatively unchanged for the quarter, as our renovated room product and continuous improvement efforts, nearly offset the slow booking pace experienced across the city, particularly in our FIT segment as a result of the tragic events on October 1. Our flat RevPAR for the quarter exceeded the LVCVA reported Las Vegas strip RevPAR, which was down 3% in the quarter. Our fourth quarter group business and forward group booking activity were not impacted and remain quite strong. Moving on to our other US segment, revenue growth continued across most of our regions, adding $24 million over the fourth quarter in the prior year, despite a $12 million reduction in marketing expense. The Midwest markets generated high single digit adjusted EBITDA growth, and Atlantic City improved revenues by 2.7%, while significantly reducing marketing expenses, resulting in increased adjusted EBITDA. I\u2019d also like to point out that since this is the first time we\u2019re reporting with new regional segments, we've posted net revenue and EBITDA by region quarterly from 2015 to 2017 on our Investor Relations website for your reference.  Turning to Slide 15, I'd like to first walk you through our cash and liquidity position. We ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion of cash enterprise wide. During the quarter, we used $300 million of the total $1.063 billion Harrah\u2019s sale proceeds to pay down our CRC revolver balance, leaving us with no borrowings outstanding on either revolver at year end. Our capital expenditures totaled $279 million in the quarter, excluding the $73 million purchase of the Eastside land. We ended the year within 2% of our full year guidance of capital. Capital expenditures in the quarter were primarily driven by the investment in our Las Vegas room product. We also used about $260 million of cash for transaction fees and debt reduction associated with the CRC and CEOC refinancings, which occurred in the fourth quarter. With the completion of these transactions, we have significantly simplified our debt structure and now hold $7.9 billion of term loans and bonds, excluding the CEC convertible note of $1.1 billion. It's also important to highlight that this was the first quarter we commenced rent payments to VICI, which were $217 million in the quarter, including an extra payment for January of $57 million made in December.  Turning now to Slide 16, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2018. We believe the Las Vegas market will continue to generate positive results in the long term. We expect the strip to continue trending towards becoming the top meeting and convention destination location in the country, with the expansion of space at the Las Vegas Convention Center, at our properties as Mark referenced, and at other properties along the strip. The continued strength in the group segment heightened - highlighted activity around professional sports, and stable room supply environment on the strip are all catalysts for the continued organic growth of our Las Vegas properties.  In addition, high consumer confidence supported growth in many of our regions through the back half of 2017, and we expect the trend to continue, provided that favorable macros persist. Recent tax reform should further support this trend. Business process improvement initiatives and the implementation of best practices across our diverse portfolio of properties, is another catalyst that will enhance our margin profile and improve free cash flow. However, we do expect to face some challenges in 2018. We believe the introduction of new competition in some of the regional markets, particularly in Atlantic City, will negatively impact our results in the second half of the year.  And during the first quarter, we continue to feel the impact on our leisure business in Las Vegas from the October 1 shootings. In addition, we anticipate increased inflationary cost pressures as we have alluded to in previous quarters. However, we have challenged our management teams to offset these negative impacts with continued focus on cost control. We expect capital expenditures to be between $500 million and $600 million for maintenance related same-store projects and room renovations during the year. We also expect to spend approximately $175 million to $200 million in 2018 on growth capital, which includes construction costs related to the convention center and also some capital costs related to be integration of Centaur. Following CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy in Q4 of 2017, we have net operating losses of approximately $2.9 billion, which are available to offset the company's future taxable income. As a result, we do not anticipate being a cash tax payer for the next three years. For more information on our taxes, including the impact of the recently passed US tax reform, please refer to our 10-K filing to be posted later today.  Looking to the first quarter specifically, recall that Horseshoe Baltimore generated about $65 million in revenue and $15 million in EBITDA in Q1 of 2017, and is now deconsolidated from our results. We anticipate Las Vegas RevPAR to be flat to down 1% on a year over year basis, primarily due to an all-time high group demand in Q1 2017 that will not be repeated in Q1 \u201918. Please note that this estimated percent change reflects the consistent revenue recognition and reporting methodology with the prior year. We also anticipate to have about 21,000 additional rooms off the market versus Q1 of 2017, caused primarily by ongoing revenues at Bally's and Flamingo. Through February, lower than expected hold percentages in our baccarat business, drove an unfavorable impact on a year over year EBITDA of approximately $10 million. That could change since the quarter is not completed yet and that business is inherently volatile. Regionally, we expect the impact of flooding and other unfavorable weather related events to drive an incremental headwind of between $10 million and $15 million against the prior year in our other US region. Some of these weather related losses are expected to be offset by insurance proceeds, but they will be realized in subsequent reporting periods. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark for some closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks, Eric. Please everyone turn to Slide 18. To recap, despite some headwinds in the fourth quarter, we achieved record same-store adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year, supported by very strong domestic gaming growth and a significant reduction in operating expenses. We also made great progress in our growth and network expansion efforts through the acquisition of Centaur Gaming, and the center strip location for our new Caesars Forum Convention Center. At the macro level, we're seeing both positive trends and consumer sentiment and spending. Unemployment levels are at historic lows and incomes are rising.  While the effects of US tax reform are expected to further strengthen discretionary consumer spending. Furthermore, many consumers are shifting spend towards travel and experiences at the same time that the airline industry dynamics continue to exhibit downward pressure on flight prices. We believe we're well positioned for success in this environment, given our strong portfolio of properties in key destination markets. Business spending is also on the rise, which creates a positive outlook for our meetings and convention division. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain our positive momentum in 2018 through our revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, continued investments in our properties and room products and the development of Caesar's Forum and potential international projects and licensing opportunities.  We will now open up the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is now from. Chad Beynon : Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Thanks for all the color there, particularly around the qualitative outlook for 2018, especially on the first quarter. And you mentioned some of the negatives, the lower hold, the flooding in the regional markets, obviously the further impact from the shooting. But as we think about 2Q through 4Q, is there any reason why we shouldn't expect for the revenues to kind of get back to what we were seeing before these abnormalities? And then from a margin perspective, is everything still on track with the 2H salesforce initiative? Thanks. Mark Frissora : Yes. I think the answer primarily overall is yes. We will - things will actually - should start to improve second, third and fourth quarter and we\u2019re hopeful also eventually luck turns our way. So when that happens, that will be a great outcome as well. And it obviously always moves to the statistical mean, so we're expecting that to happen sometime. And I would also say that the salesforce initiative is on track. We expect to actually complete what we call the primary phase of that in June. And again, we\u2019ll start yielding benefits obviously June going forward. So both - the answer to both those questions is yes. Eric, you want to add anything to that? Eric Hession : No, I think that's absolutely right. We feel - the core underlying strength of the business is quite strong. In the regional markets, you've seen general trends of having positive slot growth and general business growth. And here in Las Vegas, that's certainly been the case, with the exception of the impact on the hotel ADRs that we experienced in the fourth quarter that rolled a little bit into the first quarter. Chad Beynon : Great. Thanks. And then just kind of moving on to capital allocation, the acquisition that you made in the fourth quarter, at least on our numbers had a very positive free cash flow accretion, mainly because of the cost basis of Harrah's Las Vegas, and also just the assets that you were buying. Could you just kind of update us on I guess the NOLs or cash basis for some of those properties in Las Vegas? And then more importantly, if there aren't opportunities that would yield a similar type of free cash flow accretion, how do you think about capital allocation with respect to buybacks or debt pay down? Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure. I'll take a shot at that. So the Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas had the lowest basis of our properties. As you'd expect, it's one of the oldest that we've had in the portfolio, and as a result, it did have the lowest basis. The others have higher basis. They\u2019re still somewhat below their sale values, but there shouldn't be as much a variance between that which would result in a gain. In terms of the use of the free cash flow as we move forward, you're absolutely right. we have to balance the investment in the business, investment in other opportunities that we have from an acquisition perspective that could generate great returns, and then evaluate if we have additional cash available, how to return that best to shareholders. We've shown models and you can run your projections that do show a substantial cash balance being generated over time. And as a result, we look in the future to returning some of that cash to shareholders. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you very much and thanks for the segment disclosure as well for our models. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. John DeCree : Hey everyone. Thanks for the questions. Two questions. Wanted to stick with Las Vegas first and kind of talk a little bit more about the relative RevPAR performance that you guys reported and expect in 1Q. you've cited kind of room renovations as a big driver of that, but wanted to get some more color as to how much you think is room renovations and some of the other initiatives you're doing on the hotel front that might be contributing to that strong performance. Eric Hession : Yes. I think it's a combination of things. We certainly believe that as we renovate rooms, we are continuing to achieve the increases in room rates consistent with what we've experienced before. We\u2019re now a little over 50% complete from renovating our room product. And so that is definitely complete - contributing to that. We also have continued to deploy additional revenue management techniques, and have further modified our website, which allow us to drive additional bookings to those higher margin channels, which flow through into higher ADRs. Mark Frissora : And just to add to that, there's obviously some displacement in the convention business from quarter to quarter that will impact RevPAR in a negative way as you will. And then there's the - some lingering effects as well from the tragedy that occurred in October. So those are kind of the drivers. I guess I would say that the latter two that I mentioned probably are some of the bigger drivers of what was our forecast if you will for the first quarter. John DeCree : Got it. Thanks for the additional color there. And then high level, wanted to shift gears to the other US markets where we've noticed you guys starting to gain some market share in some key markets in the back half of the year and 4Q at the same time that you're kind of reengineering the marketing program and pulling back on marketing and promotional expense. So you've been able to kind of pull back on that expense, but also gain some market share. It seems like some things are really starting to work well. Wanted to get some - your thoughts or some additional color on that and if that's a trend that you hope or expect to continue kind of through the rest of \u201918, barring some of the issues with weather that you had cited and we've seen in some markets. Mark Frissora : Yes. Of course we were very enthused by the market share results regionally and the fact that we were pulling back on marketing expense at the same time. We\u2019re being very selective and strategic in the way we look at the expense cuts, and we're just doing kind of customer at a time segmentation that allows us to reprogram if you will what we do. As you might imagine, with as many offers as we make to our 36 properties really exceeding $1 billion a year, those offers don't all go out one by one. So we're just peeling back the onion and finding smarter ways of using the money, engaging people through email, engaging them one on one, has allowed us to actually get a bigger benefit from those people that are in fact good customers of ours. And then those are not necessarily profitable, again we're able to deselect those. So it's been encouraging because we're expecting to continue to see this progress throughout the year. So to answer your question on that thing, yes, we expect to continue to show I would say rather significant improvements in marketing efficiency throughout 2018. John DeCree : Mark, a quick follow up on that if I could. When you kind of think about the size of the opportunity and where you are in kind of implementing that strategy, would you say it's still kind of early innings on your vision for getting all those things kind of working at the right at level? Mark Frissora : Specifically, what are you asking, about marketing or other? John DeCree : On marketing, exactly, in calibrating your marketing programs. You have a massive database, 36 properties. Are you - you still have a lot of run room in terms of what you can do in calibrating how you approach your database and your promotional program. Is there a lot more ahead? Mark Frissora : As I mentioned to you, I feel in 2018 it's safe to forecast that we'll continue to show good efficiency. We\u2019re doing - as you might imagine, we're very cautious about making sure market share is not impacted. So we do a lot of tests and learns, and what I mean by that, we test let\u2019s say different offers and types of the offers, size of them, the frequency of them. And then as we learn, we become more efficient. So we have lots of experiments going on and depending on how those experiments go, we have ample opportunity ahead of us. So that's the best way I can answer it. It\u2019s kind of like we know this year is going to be a good year. Beyond that, I\u2019d hate to forecast anything that - for future efficiencies until we actually have the tests and the test and learn experiments back to us. John DeCree : Fair enough. Appreciate the color, Mark. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Just wanted to go through and ask a little bit about margins. You guys called out in the prepared remarks kind of a number of factors that were out there, right, a combination of competition, the increased inflationary cost pressures. And then obviously you're going to be starting a little bit in a hole in Q1. Just kind of curious, could you give us just your thoughts at a high level as to whether or not, given all that but on the flip side what you guys are working on so diligently on the continuous improvement side, I mean what are the chances that we can see margin improvement in 2018? Is that a stretch goal or is that a realistic probability? Eric Hession : Yes. Shaun, thanks for the question. This is Eric. I would say it's a very realistic possibility. As you heard Mark on the previous question, we're expending a lot of effort making sure that we are deploying our marketing spend in the most efficient way possible. We\u2019re using a lot of new technology, a lot of systems coming online, and we're challenging our management to be creative with the way that we invest. And it seems to be working quite well. Our marketing expense is down 4% this quarter. And as you saw, we largely maintained and possibly grew share in some markets. So that's a great outcome and as we go forward, we'll be able to continue to push that.  On the corporate side, we continue to review the way that we operate and the way that we process our business, and we think there's a lot of opportunity there. And then finally, we now have green belts and black belts at all of our properties and a centralized control department for that, that we're able to push through a large number of initiatives that can deploy best practices throughout the company. So from our standpoint, despite those headwinds and the fact that we do have pressures in certain areas, we would absolutely expect the margins of the organization to be higher next year versus 2017, which as Mark mentioned, was a record in itself. Mark Frissora : Yes. and we - I would add to Eric\u2019s commentary in that we have also have a large purchasing initiative, procurement initiative around centralizing more of our spend and doing it in an efficient way and we feel that that's going to yield significant results for us this year as well. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thanks for the clarity on that. So second question would just be on just Las Vegas overall. You called out, I think you expected to see, if I got it right, it was something like 21,000 incremental room nights out of service in 1Q this year versus last year. Like can you just give us a little bit of the cadence of how that's going to play out kind of across the year and thinking about disruption headwind versus tail wind? Eric Hession : Sure. So that's in the first quarter, the 21,000. The headwind should be between $2 million to $4 million. So it's not an extremely significant impact because of the way that the rooms balance themselves. And then as we move through the rest of the year, we would expect it to be more neutral, at least in the second and third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, we'll have a little bit of a headwind again. Shaun Kelley : Okay, great. And last question, Eric would be on - more of a modeling question is more on cash interest expense. Could you just walk us through what your expectations there are and then what - kind of what or if any potential refinancings or maturities you have in 2018 that can start to push that number lower? Eric Hession : Sure. We\u2019re projecting right now, if you look at the kind of expected LIBOR curve to have an interest expense of around $410 million to $415 million a year. That could obviously change with LIBOR. At this point, I don't anticipate refinancings. We\u2019ve completed the refinancings of both CRC and CEOC. We may - in the prepared remarks, Mark mentioned from the Centaur acquisition, there may be an opportunity to issue some additional term loan or some bonds. But I wouldn't anticipate refinancings at this time, given the great interest rates that we have on the term loans. Of course that could change the rate swing significantly. Joyce Arpin : And I would just add, Shaun that the numbers Eric quoted were without Baltimore, but do include cash interest expense on the convert at the parent. Shaun Kelley : Great. Okay, thank you very much everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura/Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : Good afternoon everyone. Just to follow up - hello. Just a quick follow up on the RevPAR outlook in Vegas for 2018. MGM was out with a full year guidance of RevPAR in the 2% to 4% range. Eric, you mentioned strong forward group bookings. Yet what's interesting is that their first quarter is going to be tougher than yours. Do you think that you can meet or exceed that - the same range that they're out there with - based on what you've got on the books? Mark Frissora : Yes. Eric Hession : Yes. We see the weakness that we\u2019re experiencing in the first quarter, the flat to down 1% not persisting throughout the remainder of the year. In fact, the group calendar for us is still strong this year, up kind of low single digits. And then the next two years, it's actually improved and it's up in the high single digits. So we\u2019re pleased with that. From a RevPAR perspective, we would expect to be somewhere in that mid-single digits for the year, including the first quarter. So somewhere between 4% and 6% we think is reasonable. Mark Frissora : I would indicate - I\u2019ll also mention to you that we've been able to demonstrate for the last two years that we typically double whatever the RevPAR is, and it's due to the room renovation projects that we're doing. Of course we also have some - actually some learning projects that we have, advanced projects and revenue management. And our system changes this year are actually going to be able to give us a lot more real time information on pricing versus what we've had historically. So on the margin, we expect to be able to actually earn more if you will through our pricing as we do it here on the strip than we have in the past because of enhanced capability. So I think we're pretty bullish on that. Harry Curtis : That's great. And a follow up question. You mentioned that the - your volumes in the first quarter, your baccarat volumes are up. Can you give us a sense of how much they\u2019re up? And the reason I'm curious is, is there a noticeable trend in higher demand from your baccarat customers? Mark Frissora : I\u2019d say that we have quite a bit more - significantly more Asian business than we had in the first quarter of last year. The Chinese New Year for us was exceptionally strong. So yes, I mean it was much higher than last year. So we felt good about that. That\u2019s - the health of the business is definitely there. Eric Hession : We just weren\u2019t lucky. Mark Frissora : Yes, that's right. As you know, luck can change and even in this quarter, we\u2019re not positive at this point, but we\u2019re hopeful as we continue to get high roller play, that can change on a daily basis. Harry Curtis : Very good. And my last question, when you look at your promotional allowances as a percentage of GGR, just a follow up question on the - on your margin opportunity. You're at roughly 20% and that's 700 and 900 basis points higher than some of your competitors. To what degree is that related to just administration costs of having Total Rewards in place? And then when you back that out, do you think that you are - over the next couple of years, likely to focus on increasing the efficiencies, particularly with like multiple offers out to single customers, multiple offers from casinos that are within your Vegas property. I mean where I'm going with this is, to what degree is there room within the Total Rewards system to cut administration and duplicate costs/ Mark Frissora : I think that our administration cost of Total Rewards continues to go down, as does efficiency of our offers. And it's driven - the sales force initiative we talked about was a big technology initiative that goes in place in June, and that's going to drive further efficiency. On campaigns that would typically take us four to five months lead time, we reduce that to two to three weeks lead time. So we're much more real time in our offers and smarter than we believe competition will be oftentimes because of the system investment that we made. That is one driver that will continue to drive our efficiency. I think that we\u2019re also low cost as you mentioned in terms of our shared services organization. We\u2019ve had this in place for years and it's just gotten better and better. Part of it driven through again, technology.  For example, the General Electric system that we just put in was costing us roughly $12 million a year to administrate. It now costs us $3 million a year to administrate. It\u2019s in the clouds. It\u2019s real time. It\u2019s more secure. so if we use that as an example, as a proxy for the other four platforms that are being implemented in the company, and two of those will be completed this year, and then the other two finished probably by the year 2020 or so. So we feel very comfortable that those system changes, that technology change that\u2019s going to not only enhance the customer experience, but may just make us more efficient. And then when we do acquisitions, it'll be much easier to plug and play if you will those actual new acquisitions and casinos right into our system. And we\u2019ll be very efficient. We\u2019ll get very good flow through on obviously the synergies, both at the revenue level and the cost level. Harry Curtis : That's very helpful. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. Good afternoon everyone. I wanted to ask about the Indiana acquisitions that are pending. And I apologize if I missed this. Is there any update on when you expect those to close? I know we talked about the first half of this year and if you have sort of learned anything new about those opportunities or any surprises as you move down the road. Eric Hession : Yes. We haven\u2019t addressed that specifically. At this point, we\u2019re anticipating a late June closure. We can - we\u2019ll continue to update as we get additional information. We need two regulatory approvals still. But the team, from an integration perspective, is actively working to get ready. Some of the long lead time items from an IT perspective we've started purchasing and are ready to roll out to integrate Total Rewards as quickly as possible. What I can say is that we're very optimistic in the amount of synergies that we're going to be able to capture.  We've been working with the local teams who are great operators and really can recognize the scale and the technology that we've been able to procure in our central organization that can be deployed to really help out the operations. On top of that, again we think that there's a lot of excitement and a lot of opportunity on the revenue side that can be generated from Total Rewards. And then the horseracing operations of course are excellent and their capital investment has been very high and they're extremely high quality. So everything we're finding about the properties has met or exceeded our expectations. So we're very optimistic about the success of the purchase. David Katz : Okay. And just one more if I may. I appreciate all of the disclosure and information on the guidance and all the topics discussed so far. But the topic of sports betting and its opportunity should it become a legal and viable avenue for you all, what thoughts have you about that and how much time and effort you're putting into what that could be? Mark Frissora : A lot of time and effort, and we think the potential is big. And we expect to be in a position day one to do something about it when and if this legislation passes. So we\u2019re hopeful it does, but other than just making some general comments like that, difficult for us to give specifics, but we do expect to be in a position to take advantage of it. And we feel that given the number of locations we have, the strength of our gaming platforms, mobile, all the things we're investing in, and we think we\u2019ll be in a very good position to take advantage of it. David Katz : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Pace : Hi. Thank you. A couple of different topics here. So the first one for Eric. So the new reporting makes it a little difficult for us credit folks. Any chance you can share revenue and EBITDA, or better yet, the growth rates at the bond group CRC? And if not, when can we expect financials for that division? Eric Hession : Yes. We\u2019re going to be reporting a full package of CRC financials and information in approximately a week to 10 days. So it will lag our companywide 10-K, but you'll have that visibility as well. And then for CEOC, that\u2019s posted specifically for the lenders. Mike Pace : Maybe to ask it a little differently and push a little bit more. In the slides and in the press release, you said that same-store Vegas revenues were down around 4% and EBITDA down 10%. I think Caesars Palace had a weaker than average to those numbers. Is it fair to assume then the rest of Vegas did I guess average better, which would largely be in the CRC Group? Eric Hession : Yes. That\u2019s a fair inference, particularly if you simply adjust for hold, which we indicated is almost exclusively at Caesars Palace. The rest would be - of the Vegas market would be attributable to the other properties. Mike Pace : And then maybe to have me avoid asking this again, I guess any update on plans to merge CEOC and CRC? I think you talked about doing that maybe in the first half of this year, but any thoughts there would be great. Eric Hession : We continue to evaluate it. Again, there are a lot of priorities within the company from a growth perspective and from a capital structure perspective. And that\u2019s definitely one that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate. I wouldn't want to put a timeline on it at this point, but it's certainly something that we have on our list as a potential opportunity. Mike Pace : And then I guess two big picture questions on leverage and for Mark or you, Eric. I guess the first one on potential M&A opportunities, how should we think about you using leverage for M&A? Would you lever up a little bit or would you prefer to structure it in kind of the leverage neutral manner you did in Centaur? And then you also talked about returning capital to shareholders in Q&A earlier down the road. Is there a specific leverage level that you would target before you would consider doing that? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yes. I'll take the first pass. I think generally speaking, we would prefer to make acquisitions when we do that are leverage neutral or deleveraging. However, I would say that each acquisition is specific and unique and we'll have to evaluate the existing market conditions and the specific dynamics about the acquisition. But in general, our objective is to reduce leverage over time within the overall CEC entity. And so having an acquisition strategy that's consistent with that, would make sense.  In terms of returning cash to shareholders, again we do have an internal leverage target, and returning cash to shareholders is certainly a component of that. I wouldn't anticipate us necessarily having to reach our ultimate leverage target before returning some cash to shareholders, if that's what we elected to do because of the fact that we\u2019re able to project our relatively stable cash flows and the growth of those cash flows over time. We\u2019ll be able to balance the use of those in terms of investing in our core business, exploring acquisitions using that cash and then returning the cash to shareholders and ultimately potentially deleveraging through debt repurchases as well. Mike Pace : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Farrell with WF. Your line is open. Dennis Farrell : Great. Thank you. That wasn\u2019t my music. But anyway, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the NOL balance. That came in a lot higher than we were expecting. So congrats on that. And I'm just wondering, as you think about that NOL balanced and this acquisition for Centaur, what is DNA going to look like pro-forma for Centaur for the company on a full year basis? Eric Hession : Yes. I can talk about the NOLs to start. You\u2019re right. They came in on the higher end of our range that we gave last quarter at $2.9 billion. It's a sizable amount of value for the company. And given some of the dynamics in the new tax code that was announced right at the end of the year, the applicability of some of those NOLs to more current periods was favorably determined in that legislation. And so that'll allow us, as we noted, to basically fully offset any of our anticipated gains for the next three years. It\u2019s definitely a positive for our cash flow, after tax cash flow. And so we would anticipate being able to deliver on that. In terms of our depreciation for going forward, we haven't yet provided that for the Centaur transaction. And so we'll have to wait until we complete the merger accounting. Dennis Farrell : Okay. And then could you just give us an update on the convert and potentially how long do you expect that to stay outstanding? Eric Hession : Yes. So the convert now is obviously well in the money. I believe it's trading at around 200, reflecting the stock price appreciation since the strike price was determined. We are unable to call the convert until three years after emergence. However, it may make sense for us to try to convert some of it early through either buying it back or offering incentives to convert into shares ahead of time. We'll look at that in the context of our overall capital strategy and what we do with our excess cash and what our capital structure ultimately looks like from a complexity standpoint. Dennis Farrell : Okay. And then in regards to the previous question on sports betting, I mean how - under the current legislation, it seems like New Jersey is going to have a pretty decent sized head start on everyone, and you're well positioned in that market. I'm just wondering, how will it look in regards to mobile versus like just doing sports betting and the sports book in your casinos in Atlantic City? And then also, I guess the last part of that question would be, if it does - if the Supreme Court does pass it in its current form, do you expect the other states - how long do you think it would take other states to kind of get up and running? Eric Hession : Yes. It\u2019s tough to say. I'll jump in and then see if Mark has anything to add. The - New Jersey does appear to be in the lead with that. We would anticipate that much like the online gaming itself within the state, they would offer a product that can be used both in the casinos and remotely. We think it will benefit our casinos in New Jersey. We know for example that here in Las Vegas, some of our top days are the Super Bowl and NCAA weekend and some other sporting event days and we think that that will help Atlantic City. People will want to go to Atlantic City on the weekends to watch football and bet in our sports books which will become potentially larger components of the property.  Beyond that, there have been I believe four states that have passed legislation and there are another eight or 10 that have it pending. They vary significantly from states where it appears that you would have to sign up in the casino and can play in the casino, to states that\u2019s similarly like New Jersey, what we\u2019d anticipate where you could sign up and play anywhere within the state. So I think the pace of this will be over time for sure with the various legislative cycles and as the States decide how they're going to regulate it and implement it. But it certainly seems like a very solid, large growth opportunity for the industry. And as Mark mentioned earlier, we think we're very well positioned, being in a number of different States and having some very strong brands and also operating online businesses in Nevada and New Jersey right now. Dennis Farrell : And then just lastly. In terms of tax reform, when - how are you handling your CapEx? I mean are you able to expense all that in the first year or? I mean that\u2019s a big question we got from a lot of investors early on. I'm just wondering about that. And then also in terms of making acquisitions, I mean does the current tax changes really incentivize you to make domestic acquisitions versus international? Mark Frissora : I\u2019m just going to say, this is the last question. We\u2019ve got other investors and analysts that have to get in line here. So I\u2019ll let Eric go ahead and take a crack at that. Eric Hession : Yes. Just quickly, the rules are fairly clear that short duration assets can be expensed and then long assets would still have to be depreciated. So for example, with our convention center, a portion of that would be certainly accelerated and then a portion would have to be amortized effectively over time. We\u2019ll take advantage of the new tax rules and it's certainly, for an item like a restaurant, would - most of that's going to be accelerated. In terms of M&A and acquisitions, from our standpoint it really doesn't have a large impact. We\u2019re mostly a domestic company at this point and we don't have a lot of the international subsidies of others. Dennis Farrell : Okay. Thank you for your time. Operator : We have time for one last question. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Your line is open. Patrick Scholes : Good afternoon. Just one question here. I had read in a news article that - or an industry rag that you folks had - obviously have been down to Brazil. Wonder if you can give us a little bit of color what may be going on, what\u2019s the probability of that happening, potential size and scope of your investment down there? Mark Frissora : First of all, we don't comment on anything of any activity regarding mergers, acquisitions or any kind of opportunity. But so I think that whatever industry journalists say doesn't necessarily have to be true. But we certainly will be in a position, if for example Brazil legalizes gambling and we always look at every opportunity, and we\u2019ll look at this one just as thoroughly as we do any other opportunity developmentally in the world. Patrick Scholes : Okay. And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Joyce Arpin. Q - Patrick Scholes : Thank you everyone for joining and we\u2019ll talk to you in a couple of months. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Cristina, and I will be your event specialist today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Joyce Arpin, Vice President of Finance and Assistant Treasurer. The floor is yours. Joyce Arpin : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment First Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment are Mark Frissora, President and CEO; and Eric Hession, CFO. A copy of our press release, earnings presentation and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section on our website at caesars.com. Also please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of our earnings release to the SEC in a Form 8-K and will file a Form 10-Q. Before we get underway, I would like to remind you to reference slides 2 through 4, which include forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers and definitions and certain non-GAAP measures. In addition, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, or CEOC, emerged from bankruptcy on October 6 and Caesars Entertainment Corporation completed its merger with Caesars Acquisition Company or CAC on that date. We also deconsolidated the results of Horseshoe Baltimore in the third quarter of 2017. Therefore, our U.S. GAAP results do not include CEOC in Q1 2017 and include Horseshoe Baltimore, same-store results include CEOC in the prior year but exclude Horseshoe Baltimore. You can find a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP figures on slides 25 to 28. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please turn to Slide 6. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Joyce. I\u2019m pleased to report that Caesars Entertainment delivered solid operating performance in the first quarter, reflecting progress on our marketing initiatives, continued success in driving operating efficiencies and strong execution on our growth initiatives. First quarter net revenues of $1.97 billion and adjusted EBITDAR of $518 million increased year-over- year since CEOC\u2019s results are not included in the prior year. Same-store revenue decreased 2% year-over-year to $1.97 billion. We experienced robust gaming volumes in Las Vegas led by the strongest Chinese New Year volumes in five years. Core business growth was offset by some notable headwinds, including unfavorable hold impact on revenues of $22 million year-over-year, several weather-related property closures in the other U.S. segment, lower hospitality revenues in Las Vegas due to the cycling of the CON/AGG construction trade show and some lingering impact from the October 1 shooting. Las Vegas RevPAR declined 1% year-over-year, and we are outperforming our peers in the Las Vegas Strip who reported average RevPAR down approximately 2.5%. Domestic slot win increased sequentially throughout the quarter and, adjusted for the impact of bad weather, was up 1% versus Q1 2017. Slot win and hotel results were also up to a solid start in April, giving us more confidence and a positive outlook for the full year. Same-store adjusted EBITDAR decreased 3.4% year-over-year to $518 million due to unfavorable hold and bad weather but was offset by outstanding cost control efforts in labor and marketing. On a hold-normalized basis, adjusted EBITDAR was flat year-over-year. Unfavorable hold impact on EBITDAR this quarter was primarily driven by baccarat play at Caesars Palace. Our peers held well in this segment during the quarter, and we believe that this is the primary driver of movement and market share. Excluding baccarat play, we gained 60 basis points of gaming market share on the Las Vegas Strip. We have provided supplemental information in the appendix of the presentation to provide more insight into baccarat hold, which has been a profitable business for us over time. I\u2019m also very pleased to announce that our board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, marking the first anticipated return of capital to shareholders since prior to the LBO. We\u2019re very proud that we are able to take this step, following several years of strong performance and tireless efforts to transform our balance sheet. We are committed to taking a well-balanced approach to enhancing shareholder value using all methods at our disposal. Eric will go into more detail on our capital allocation strategy later in the call. On Slide 7. Our cornerstone initiatives summarized here form the foundation of our strategy to accelerate organic and inorganic growth. Today, I would like to focus on our marketing programs, which we are constantly evolving to drive greater returns on our marketing investments. I will also highlight some exciting progress on our asset-light operating and licensing strategy, which expands our network. Turning to Slide 8. As many of you know, we believe there is substantial cost and revenue upside to increasing our marketing efficiency, which has been an area of focus and innovation for us. We have been very active in testing, learning and in optimizing new digital marketing capabilities. With machine learning technology to guide our reinvestment decisions at the individual customer level, we are able to produce more accurate and predictive algorithms that help us rebalance and optimize our marketing spend. These initiatives have improved our ability to provide the right incentives to our guests while reducing non-accretive offers. One example of this that we can share today is a coding contest we ran last year. We provided disguised data to coders around the world and asked them to come up with the optimal algorithm. Using the results from the contest, we were able to dramatically improve our ability to predict future value contribution of a particular customer. We have a successful pilot during the first quarter at certain properties and have now rolled the algorithm out across all of our domestic properties. We\u2019re optimistic this effort will yield additional revenues while reducing expenses. We continue to meaningfully reduce total marketing spend as a percent of gross gaming revenue over the last several quarters while average spend per trip increased across most customers segments. Domestic marketing expenses were down 11% year-over-year or $55 million this quarter, and we expect to continue to focus on this initiative in the long term. It\u2019s important to note we\u2019re not just cutting spend across the board, we are increasing marketing reinvestment for a large number of our guests with more visibility into the returns on our investments across the entire data business and a more accurate picture of which offers are most valuable to our guests. Next, I\u2019d like to share some updates on our branding and licensing strategy on Slide 9. There\u2019s a broad portfolio of iconic brands that we have been seeking to leverage domestically and internationally through management and licensing agreements. Over the last month, we announced plans to bring the Caesars brand to two new beachfront resorts in Dubai and a resort in Cabo and bring the Harrah\u2019s brand to a new tribal casino in California. These projects exemplify our asset-light growth strategy, which will expand our brands, create new sources of revenue and facilitate broad distributions of the Total Rewards program, all with minimal capital deployment. On slides 10 to 12, I\u2019d like to provide you more detail on these three deals. We have entered into a nonbinding letter of intent with Meraas Holdings to brand and manage a large scale Caesars Palace Resort complex in the popular Jumeirah Beach region of Dubai, one of the top tourist destinations in the region. The complex will include two luxury five-star quality resorts, two serviced apartments, 10 residential buildings, 200 food and beverage in retail outlets, a convention center and a beach club and the largest observation wheel in the world. Under the terms of the letter of intent, Caesars Entertainment will manage both hotels, branded Caesars Palace and Caesars, the convention center, the beach club and the observation wheel. We will also brand and manage all hospitality aspects of the 180 serviced apartments. When the transaction and development are completed, these luxury hotels will be the first Caesars hotels without a gaming component and will be focused in offering our guests world-class hospitality and entertainment experiences. The hotels are expected to open later this year, with the observation wheel opening in 2019. This project will expand our international footprint and grow the Caesars brand in a key destination region. Realization of the project is, of course, subject to negotiation and definitive documentation, completion of construction and other conditions. Next, we have entered into an agreement to open a new Caesars Palace in the prime tourist region of Cabo, Mexico in partnership with experienced developer, Grupo Questro, who will own the Caesars Entertainment managed assets. This $200 million beachfront property will carry a luxury resort with 500 rooms, suites and villas, a 50,000 square-foot convention center, 40,000 square feet of meeting space, a 25,000 square foot full-service spa, three fine-dining restaurants entertainment venue, pools, tennis courts and access to the area\u2019s best golf courses. The developer expects to break ground in the first half of 2019. We anticipate opening in the fourth quarter of 2020. On the domestic front, we are working with Buena Vista Tribe of Me-Wuk Indians to open a new 71,000 square foot Harrah\u2019s Northern California casino near Sacramento, California. The $170 million property will include 950 state-of-the-art slots, 20 table games, one full-service restaurant and three fast-casual dining concepts. The developers began construction of the property, and we expect an opening date in Q2 2019. The new property will expand our Total Rewards network and grow the Harrah\u2019s brand in a capital-efficient way in an attractive new market through a mutually beneficial relationship. Caesars has long-standing relationships with various Native American communities across North America dating back 20 years, and we are the only gaming operator to renew agreements with tribes multiple times. We currently operate four tribal-owned casinos in three states, and we see extending our agreement with the Cherokee tribe in North Carolina for a period of seven years. Our experience gained through these relationships is an opportunity for us going forward as Native American gaming expands in the U.S. These three exciting new destinations will further our growth strategy by increasing awareness of our brands in key destination cities through an asset-light model, while growing and diversifying our income stream with reliable management fees. We believe each project could be worth $5 million to $10 million in incremental annual EBITDAR. We will continue to look for attractive licensing and management opportunities, both domestically and internationally. Moving to Slide 13, I want to highlight another important partnership. Earlier in Q1, we announced a new partnership with Zappos and officially renamed the AXIS at Planet Hollywood to Zappos Theater. With the AXIS, we are able to take an underutilized asset, introduce our highly successful entertainment residency strategy, with headliners like Jennifer Lopez and the Backstreet Boys, and turn it in the second-highest grossing theater in the U.S. The success enabled us to implement a branding and sponsorship strategy with a partner like Zappos. Core to our entertainment strategy is making our Las Vegas venues the destination for headliner acts that appeal to a wide variety of audiences. And we\u2019re building on strong momentum in 2017 with an impressive lineup this year. We recently announced that Gwen Stefani will begin a new residency at Zappos Theater beginning in June with strong ticket sales to date, marking the newest addition to our roster of top-rated headliners. We also just announced the return of Mariah Carey to Caesars Palace with a brand-new show, The Butterfly Returns. Our headliner business continues to be an important driver of incremental hotel, gaming and food and beverage revenue at Planet Hollywood and across the city. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Eric to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019ll start with our quarterly same-store segment results followed by a review of the company\u2019s liquidity position and capital structure. I\u2019ll then conclude with some notable items for the second quarter and also the full year before turning it back over to Mark for closing comments. Please turn to Slide 15. Today\u2019s commentary will cover same-store results, unless otherwise stated. Same-store commentary include CEOC results and exclude the Horseshoe Baltimore from the prior year. Same-store net revenues were down 2% year-over-year to $1.97 billion. Las Vegas net revenue was $906 million, down 2.6% versus the prior year quarter-to-date due to unfavorable hold of $19 million per year and the CON/AGG convention not recurring this year. Adjusted for unfavorable hold, Las Vegas gaming revenue was up slightly versus the prior year quarter, and cash ADR was up meaningfully when excluding the convention-impacted results of March. Results were also negatively impacted by about 37,000 rooms off the market in Q1 of 2017 for ongoing renovations at Bally\u2019s and Flamingo. Our Las Vegas RevPAR was down 1% against the prior year period and was in line with our guidance for the quarter. Moving on to our other U.S. segment. Revenue declined 1.2% due to the impact of flooding and other unfavorable weather-related events which, together, amounted to a revenue headwind of approximately $25 million and an EBITDA impact of approximately $15 million when compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of bad weather, we estimate net revenues would have been up approximately 1.5% in the other U.S. segment. Note that some of these weather-related losses are expected to be offset by insurance recoveries, but they will be realized in future periods. EBITDAR across our regional properties increased 7.5%, reflecting exceptional cost management and improved marketing efficiency. Our regional margins improved 180 basis points. Marketing efficiency improved across the board and played a critical role in more than offsetting the impact of the multiple property closures and bad weather. As a reminder, on last quarter\u2019s call, we discussed noncash interest and depreciation expenses associated with the real estate assets that were transferred to VICI Properties and leased back to CEOC. These assets are on our books at the purchase accounting multiple, which is higher than industry standard. Therefore, booked interest expense is larger than our actual lease payments. And booked depreciation expense is also elevated due to the fair value adjustment at emergence. This reduced our net income by $159 million this quarter, and we expect the impact will increase gradually over time. We\u2019ve provided an estimate for these expenses for the full year in the appendix to this presentation. I would like to point out that since this is the first quarter incorporating the new revenue recognition standards in our financials, we have also provided restated figures by region for the last two years and also by quarter on our Investor Relations website. In addition, we\u2019ve added a slide to this presentation that walks through these accounting changes to the appendix of the presentation. Turning to Slide 16, I would like to walk you through our debt, cash and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of cash enterprise-wide. Our capital expenditures totaled $85 million in the quarter, driven by large room renovation projects currently underway at Bally\u2019s and the Flamingo. We hold $7.9 billion of debt, excluding the CEC convertible note of $1.1 billion. Approximately 50% of our debt is fixed, which includes $2 billion of swaps. Our ratio increases to 70% when we include our lease payments as fixed debt. From an exposure perspective, a 25 basis point increase in LIBOR would increase our interest expense by slightly over $10 million annually starting in 2019. In addition, we recently repriced our CEOC term loan, reducing the spread by 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 200 basis points, which saves us approximately $8 million in annual interest expense. Turning to Slide 17, I\u2019ll discuss our quarterly and full year outlook. In the second quarter, we anticipate RevPAR growth between 3% and 5%. We also expect 30,000 fewer room nights off the market for renovation in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter, which would represent a slight tailwind. Hold had a positive impact on revenue and EBITDA in the prior year period of $13 million and $8 million, respectively. We\u2019re off to a strong start in the second quarter in both gaming and hotel which, along with our future bookings and cost trajectory, reaffirm our optimistic look for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect to generate adjusted EBITDAR of between $2.37 billion and $2.42 billion, which assumes a closing date of July for the Centaur acquisition. This range also includes a negative impact of approximately $40 million from the increased competition in Atlantic City. Depending on when and how many competitors open, this number could change as we continue to monitor the progression of that competitive environment. In addition, this range does not include any unanticipated hold fluctuations additional weather issues or any other unforeseen circumstances that we do not control. For the full year, our RevPAR guidance remains unchanged at a growth of between 4% and 6%. And we refined our CapEx guidance slightly to be within a range of $500 million to $575 million. In early June, we anticipate breaking ground on the Caesars Forum Convention Center. We also now consolidated our Korean joint venture, which is expected to spend approximately $100 million this year and which will be reflected in our full year results, but it will not be all our cash and will be from the joint venture. Turning to the next slide, I\u2019d like to walk you through our capital allocation framework. As you\u2019ve heard from Mark\u2019s comments, we believe that our company is well positioned for sustained growth in the coming quarters and years. We have a number of exciting growth projects, improving strengths in our core business and solid operating cost discipline. The combination of our confidence in our future operating performance, our projected free cash flow and our current cash balance gave confidence to our Board of Directors to authorize a $500 million share repurchase program. As Mark mentioned, we plan to deploy a very balanced approach to capital allocation. After using cash for rent, interest, maintenance capital and same-store growth projects, we plan to use \u2013 utilize our remaining free cash on M&A, new development activities, debt reduction and share repurchases. This includes addressing options with respect to the convertible note at the parent. Importantly, we anticipate that any acquisitions we will make will be neutral or deleveraging. The relative allocation between the categories will be balanced and will vary depending on anticipated returns, our existing and predicted cash surplus, available opportunities with respect to the M&A and development categories and, of course, current market conditions. Our plan will also be informed by our medium-term gross leverage target of 4.5 times which includes all financing obligations and is roughly 1.5 turns lower than our current leverage level. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark for closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Eric, and please turn to Slide 20. To recap, first quarter results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe the bad weather is behind us. Let us be clear, the first quarter regional gaming revenues are not a reflection on the domestic gaming consumer. We saw strong jobs reported in February and a weaker number in March, which we believe was largely impacted by the weather. Seasonally adjusted, U.S. unemployment remains at its lowest point since the early 2000s. Consumer confidence has increased from year-end despite the volatility in the market, and the current airport volumes of domestic and international passengers are up about 3%, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect to accelerate our momentum in 2018 through revenue growth and efficiency initiatives, continued investments in our properties and room product, the development of Caesars Forum and potential additional international development projects and licensing opportunities. And with the new $500 million share repurchase authorization we announced today, we will have the flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders as we continue to pursue accretive growth opportunities. We will now open the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. Mark Frissora : Hi, good afternoon. Chad Beynon : I wanted to start with the margin improvement in the quarter, mainly from the 11% reduction in marketing costs. I believe last quarter, the marketing reduction was roughly 4%. So for starters, Could you kind of help us think about what really changed from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and if that\u2019s sustainable? And then is that 11% what you\u2019re assuming in the guidance that you issued for 2018? Thank you. Mark Frissora : I think we continue to test and learn from different projects that we have going on. And each one of those projects can yield very good results, both from an efficiency but also from a revenue-generating standpoint. So I think that in terms of sustainability, we believe that this number roughly is sustainable. I\u2019m not going to give you an exact number for every single quarter, but the changes that have been made are expected to last through year-end. Some of them will anniversary out in the fourth quarter so \u2013 but at the same time, we have other projects that are moving ahead that could provide incrementality to it. So I think it\u2019s a question of directional \u2013 it\u2019s a directional number. But again, we continuously experiment and then find either new ways to invest or reduce based on the pilots that we perform. In terms of the guidance, obviously, it had \u2013 it was a piece of our guidance, but I would not say it was a large piece of our guidance in terms of our confidence. I mean we have a number of things that are going on in the company, but from a labor efficiency standpoint as well as a marketing standpoint, they contribute to our comfort level. And that includes some of the revenue initiatives that we have that are going on within our core gaming operations as well as within our hospitality operations. Eric, do you want to add to that? Eric Hession : No. I think you covered it. Chad Beynon : Thank you. And then my follow-up is with respect to Las Vegas. You noted some pretty nice share gains in the quarter. Could you kind of help us think about if the share gains came from improved marketing, your renewed product or maybe a result of all competitors? Just some color on kind of what\u2019s going on in your Las Vegas portfolio would be helpful. Eric Hession : Sure. Yeah. This is Eric. I think we\u2019ve said, we probably had a very solid first quarter given the various disruptions in the cycling of the convention. When we look forward, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the market. The forward bookings look very strong, the convention business looks strong and our RevPAR guidance reflects that confidence that we have for the rest of the year. With respect to the market share gains in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s a combination of a number of different things. Mark referenced earlier the marketing efforts that, although we are reducing marketing, we do appear to be picking up share because we\u2019re able to better effectively use the marketing we do deploy. We also, as you\u2019re aware, undertaking a room renovation project that the customers do respond very well to. It\u2019s a great, great product that we\u2019re putting out there, and about half the rooms are complete now. And then, finally, we did introduce more new slot product to the floor in the fourth quarter that came in, in that period and into the first quarter, and so that certainly contributed to it. So I think all of those factors are lining up well, and they\u2019re all also lining up well for the rest of the year just to continue to outperform. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Mark. Mark Frissora : We\u2019re also seeing \u2013 and just to add to it just for a second, we\u2019re seeing pretty strong convention business in the third quarter and some selected ones in the second quarter. So we expect \u2013 I think that we expect that we\u2019ll have a good year-over-year comparison as we move forward through the year. So that business has actually been building. The other thing that I\u2019ll mention is that 37,000 rooms were out of service in the first quarter incrementally. And that comes back online, a lot of it in the second and in the third quarter, most of it completed by the second quarter. So that will also add to our incrementality as we go forward in the year. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much and congrats on the results. Mark Frissora : Thanks. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Harry, your line is open. Your next question comes from John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. John DeCree : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to first just kind of follow-up a little bit on Chad\u2019s line of questioning and ask about 1Q. Some of your peers we\u2019ve seen at the higher end properties across the Strip had done particularly well. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on kind of across your portfolio if you saw similar at Caesars Palace being really strong or if you\u2019ve seen broad-based strength across kind of all segments in 1Q. Mark Frissora : I think that the way I\u2019d characterize this that you look at WYNN, for example, they\u2019re in a different segment. They don\u2019t participate. Their occupancy rates went down. We actually went up year-over-year. So obviously, we can get ADR and RevPAR grow if we decide we want to take our occupancy rates down. So we\u2019ve chosen, obviously, to keep our occupancy rates up, meaning there\u2019s a coverage of fixed costs, it\u2019s a smart strategy. And at the same time, we did better than the Strip, if you will, at RevPAR on average. So you\u2019ll see that kind of a strategy going forward from us. We\u2019re not going to \u2013 and we\u2019re going to see, obviously, very strong RevPAR growth of 4% to 6%. So we kind of feel like some of these properties are unique in participating in new niche markets. For us, across the board, we\u2019re doing well, I\u2019ll say, on RevPAR. And we treat this as a market \u2013 a harmonious market. And we try to appraise to the overall market not to just one individual niche hotel we try to optimize for our network. Eric, you want to add anything to that? Eric Hession : No. I would just add, we didn\u2019t see any variants in particular for any specific category, whether it\u2019s the low end or the high end. I think all the categories performed roughly the same. John DeCree : That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the incremental color. And then I just wanted to switch gear, just kind of ask a little bit more on the strategy that you\u2019ve really started to deploy in terms of adding hotels to kind of key gateway markets. I\u2019m wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about, at least high-level, kind of how the economics work out or get sized up for you guys in terms of any potential key money or capital and kind of how you expect, maybe typical Matchmade or branding fees to kind of line up to the extent you can? Eric Hession : Yeah. I\u2019ll take this one. It\u2019s \u2013 these are all capital-light projects. They do have what\u2019s traditionally a nominal amount of capital contribution from key money that \u2013 as you referenced. And so the real strategy from our perspective is to enter into these gateway of large, attractive cities, deploy a nominal amount of capital and secure management fees that Mark guided were between $5 million and $10 million per project. And in addition to that, it enhances our brand, and it also allows us to get distribution from the Total Rewards network. So we\u2019ve been very successful getting three of these kind of asset-light transactions done in the past quarter. And the team is actively engaged to continue that momentum. John DeCree : Great, helpful. Thanks for the questions. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : I hope so, can you hear me now? Eric Hession : Yes. Mark Frissora : Yeah. Harry Curtis : Yes. Just being my age. So just a little bit more detail if you could, on the strength in the second half in Vegas because, to get to your guidance, you probably need to do the high single digits in RevPAR in the second half. Can you put a little bit \u2013 give us a little bit more detail on your conventions bookings and anything else that you think would be helpful. Eric Hession : Yeah. I think your calculation is directionally accurate. We see continued improvement throughout each quarter. So the third quarter will be better than the second and then the fourth, better than the third. As we mentioned earlier, we continue to, on an aggregate full year basis, expect mid-single digits growth for our conventions given that we had a sizable decline in the first quarter. As you can imagine, that does translate into significant growth in the back half of the year. We do believe that there\u2019s very strong bookings in the third quarter, potentially all-time record. And we anticipate also that next year, the convention business continues to be strong, and we\u2019re seeing high single-digit bookings into next year. So it\u2019s definitely an improving quarter-over-quarter environment that we\u2019re seeing, both on the hotel side and also what we believe will translate in from the gaming side. We have a little less visibility there because the bookings do come later, but the calculations that you ran are directionally accurate. Harry Curtis : Okay. And just a follow-up question, given the lift in your EBITDA forecast, can you walk us through some of the puts and takes that you haven\u2019t discussed for example, your expectations for the impact of cannibalization in Atlantic City, how much you\u2019re building in for Centaur? Have your expectations changed there? Eric Hession : Yeah. Sure. So in Atlantic City, you mentioned that we\u2019re building in about a $40 million negative EBITDAR impact for this year. Since the properties haven\u2019t opened, obviously, that will all occur in the back half of the year, and so that\u2019s included in our projections. Offsetting that is the contribution from Centaur. And we\u2019ve assumed a half-year contribution from Centaur, which is roughly $70 million. That doesn\u2019t include any upside from potential synergies that we can get, but that\u2019s based on their trailing 12 run rate of roughly $140 million. Beyond that, as Mark referenced, we do include some of the performance that we\u2019ve been able to achieve on the labor side and also on the marketing side when we look at the flow-throughs. And then from the hotel side, we\u2019ve referenced the 4% to 5% growth, and that\u2019s obviously a key driver in our projections. Harry Curtis : Very good. Thanks for the help. Eric Hession : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.. David Katz : Hi, afternoon everyone. I wanted to ask about \u2013 just a little more detail around the capital allocation strategy. If I\u2019m sort of getting your leverage right, you\u2019re \u2013 at least on a trailing basis, you\u2019re a little bit over 5x, and I see that you have a target in here of around 4.5x. Is that an unachievable level considering that you used some or all of the share repurchases this year? Can all of that occur based on where the guidance is today? John DeCree : Yeah, David. Maybe, I\u2019ll jump in and clarify a few items. We did give a target of 4.5 x, but we said that, that was kind of in the medium term, which we look to be kind of a three- to five- year horizons, so it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re aspiring to achieve in this particular year. Using the calculation that capitalizes the leases on the balance sheet as well as uses of the traditional debt, we\u2019re roughly 6x levered today. So that\u2019s how you get 1.5 turns of leverage compression that we referenced as well. We do believe that based on the cash flow profile of the company and the deceleration of our capital investments and the performance of the underlying business that the amount of cash that we\u2019re generating is going to be sufficient to pursue all of those activities, including additional M&A where we identify it, some of the key development opportunities that we have as well as executing the share repurchase plan based on market conditions and also deleveraging the company over time. So we have modeled those out, and we don\u2019t think that they\u2019re at all inconsistent. David Katz : Perfect. I wasn\u2019t suggesting that it was. But I do want to follow that up and ask about the remaining properties in the portfolio that are targeted or potentially ready for renovation and, order of magnitude, how many of those there are and how much capital over the intermediate term that might consume. Eric Hession : Sure. We\u2019re maintaining our capital guidance that we had given before, which is that it does ramp down over time. We are still doing room renovations at an accelerated pace. We mentioned, this year, we\u2019ll be doing slightly fewer room renovations than last year. Last year was the peak. This year, we\u2019re primarily focusing on Bally\u2019s and Flamingo. Next year, we have room renovations planned for Paris, additional rooms at the Flamingo and potentially Harrah\u2019s as well. Those accelerated spending levels will be for two more years, and then we\u2019ll get back to our normal, what we\u2019re targeting, at $450 million per year of core maintenance capital. So that\u2019s all included in our cash flow projections, and we believe that\u2019s a reasonable amount of capital to spend such that we can keep our room product up to the expectations of the customers but also manage to have enough free cash flow to allocate to those other investments. David Katz : I have more, but I\u2019ll come back around. Thanks for the responses. Eric Hession : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ian Zaffino from Oppenheimer. Ian Zaffino : Hi guys. Thank you very much. Just wanted to delve into the buyback and again also the capital allocation. Can you just give us an idea of the choice, the size of the buyback, preference of buyback versus, let\u2019s just say, taking up the convert and then also maybe intentions to do any more sale leasebacks and others, the tower in \u2013 at Caesars Palace or anything else across the portfolio as you kind of look to expand your growth and look at other opportunities? Thanks. Eric Hession : Yeah. Sure. So we sized the $500 million buyback at what we thought was a reasonable level to go out in the market and repurchase shares over time. It\u2019s over 5% of our equity value but less than 10%, and we thought that was a good range. As we move forward, should the investment opportunities that we have outside of repurchasing our own stock change, we can certainly add to that amount if the board deems that that\u2019s a good use of the cash flow depending on the market circumstances. So that\u2019s really how we\u2019re looking at it. We wanted to give ourselves an opportunity to be able to repurchase the shares if we think they\u2019re at a great value while balancing the need to continue to grow the company because we believe that there are great targets out there, and we also believe that investing in our assets through capital and through technology are providing great deterrence as well. Ian Zaffino : And do you just want to touch on the sale leaseback or potential other sources of cash? Eric Hession : Yeah. We have those in our models as possibilities. They\u2019re somewhat out of our control in the sense that you need another party to participate in terms of executing those. So they are sources of cash. Keep in mind that we do treat that as debt. So when we enter into a sale leaseback, we\u2019ll capitalize the lease payments from a debt perspective. So it is modestly deleveraging, but there is some debt component associated with that. Ian Zaffino : Okay. Thank you very much. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hey everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. If I look at your other U.S. revenue, it was only down about 1% in the quarter and I know we don\u2019t have all the data, but if I just look at the statewide GGR data, the GGR at the bulk of your properties was down more in the 6% range. So can you just help me understand that delta? Is that maybe non-gaming streams making up the difference or maybe it\u2019s other Nevada that\u2019s not reported? Or is there some other factor that I\u2019m missing there? Eric Hession : Yeah. I think it\u2019s a combination of those states that don\u2019t break it out by property. There\u2019s also the dynamic with respect to the future revenues. So some states report the gaming revenues pre-real rewards or discounts, and some states do it post. And so we did have fairly significant reductions in our cash-back programs during the quarter, and so that could certainly be what you\u2019re reflecting. The other thing is that, included in those numbers, if you recall, we had two of our properties actually shut down. And so in some months, they were \u2013 one of them was down 40-plus percent. So that might or might not be included or excluded in your numbers. Jared Shojaian : Got it. Okay, thank you. And then can you just talk about what led you guys to decide to provide guidance right now and, specifically, why you feel more confident giving that today than you did last quarter? And then if you could also just confirm that any new potential labor agreements are already factored into that guidance. Thank you. Eric Hession : Yeah. I\u2019ll take it first. We have another quarter of information \u2013 or actually in May, so we have a third of the year done. We have better insights into what the Atlantic City impact would be, so we felt that was reasonable to quantify at this point. The Centaur transaction, we\u2019ve continued to guide towards the midpoint of the year, so that hasn\u2019t really changed. And we continue to expect that to be roughly the appropriate time line. And so we also felt that given the discussions that we\u2019d had with the analyst community and with investors in particular, that providing guidance to help people analyze the value of the company we thought would be very helpful, and so we elected to go ahead and do that this quarter. In terms of the union contracts and other cost-related items, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve taken into account an estimate of our trajectory of expenses, both the marketing and the labor side. And so unless there are shocks to the system, we would expect that everything should be included in that. Jared Shojaian : All right. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Pace from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mike Pace : Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess just getting back to the leverage target, thank you for including all the definitions of what you\u2019re including in the numerator and the denominator there, but I\u2019m wondering how you guys landed on 4.5x gross fully loaded leverage over a three to five-year period of time. Just your thought process, why that number, why that time period? Eric Hession : Yeah. We wanted to provide a target so that we also \u2013 that it was achievable, given where we think the company is heading, and one that would provide some information to you and to the investors, but one that also wouldn\u2019t inhibit the company from pursuing the activities that we wanted to do. So when we look over the multiyear period and we look at the opportunities that are on the table, we look at the various investments and we look at our cash that\u2019s being generated from the operations, we felt that this is a very achievable target and also one that we think will provide some good direction from people analyzing the company over the period of time. I also think that generally, the economy has been on up cycle for a fairly extended period of time, and we are in a consumer-facing business. And as a result, having a profile over time makes sense from a risk perspective, and that\u2019s where we wanted to head. Mike Pace : And then just two on the capital structure. The Centaur funding, you raised $1 billion from selling billion from selling the real estate under Harrah\u2019s, so you have 600-ish left. How should we expect you to fund that cash or new debt? And then since you brought it up in your prepared remarks, you mentioned convert options, I just want to ask convert options include issuing the underlying shares as part of that. Eric Hession : Sure. In both questions, we\u2019ll have to say that we\u2019re still evaluating all of the different opportunities that we have. I think it\u2019s important to note out that, you\u2019re right, we raised $1 billion to fund the Centaur transaction and we do have sufficient capacity under our revolver. So we\u2019re not relying on the debt component to be able to complete the transaction. That said, issuing debt or doing some other type of fundraising might be an appropriate action to take, and we haven\u2019t decided exactly how we\u2019re going to fully finance the Centaur transaction, but there are a lot of different options available to us, and we\u2019ll have to pick at the time which is the best one to do. Regarding the convert, there are a number of different options there as well. And so we\u2019re evaluating that with respect to how best and if and when to try to reduce the amount of convert that\u2019s outstanding. Mark Frissora : Operator, if there\u2019s no further questions \u2013 yeah. Go ahead. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Thank you to all our participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes our webcast. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Sarah, and I will be your event specialist. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Joyce Arpin, Vice President of Finance and Assistant Treasurer. Ms. Arpin, the floor is yours. Joyce Arpin : Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and CEO; and Eric Hession, CFO. A copy of the press release, earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at caesars.com. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of the earnings release to the SEC and a Form 8-K and will file our Form 10-Q. Before we get underway, I would like to remind you to reference Slides 2 through 4, which include forward-looking statements, safe harbor disclaimers and definitions of certain non-GAAP measures. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today's date and we have no obligation to update or revise them. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to unanticipated hold fluctuations, weather or other unforeseen circumstances that we do not control. There are certain risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our filings with the SEC, that may impact our results. In addition, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, or CEOC, emerged from bankruptcy on October 6, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation completed its merger with Caesars Acquisition Company, or CAC, on that date. We also deconsolidated the results of Horseshoe Baltimore in the third quarter of 2017. Therefore, U.S. GAAP results do not include CEOC in Q2 '17 and include Horseshoe Baltimore; same-store results include CEOC in the prior year, but exclude Horseshoe Baltimore. You can find reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP figures starting on Slide 26. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please turn to Slide 6 Mark Frissora : Thank you, Joyce. Caesars Entertainment delivered strong results in the second quarter, underpinned by ongoing investments in our core gaming and hospitality offerings and continued success in executing our continuous-improvement strategy. In Las Vegas, same store revenues grew by 7.5% and adjusted EBITDAR grew by 16.4%, primarily driven by an uplift in gaming and hospitality revenues. During the quarter, we completed room renovations at Bally's and begin the second phase of the Flamingo room renovation project. As of today, we have refreshed approximately 60% of our total Las Vegas room inventory since 2014, and we expect room renovations to drive further benefits to our Las Vegas revenues in 2018. We have posted a schedule detailing remaining room renovations across the portfolio in the appendix of the presentation for your reference. Enterprise-wide same-store net revenues totaled $2.12 billion for the quarter, up 2.8% year-over-year, driven by strength in Las Vegas. Same-store adjusted EBITDAR improved 13.1%, led by strong Las Vegas gaming and hospitality performance and significant regional marketing and labor efficiency improvements. Adjusted EBITDAR margin improved 270 basis points to 29.4%, making the highest ever Q2 margin for us. Marketing efficiency, which measures marketing cost as a percent of gross revenue, improved 180 basis points year-over-year to 19.3% and improved 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. Hold had a favorable impact of only $7 million compared to the prior year. I do want to make one important clarification to investors. We did not rely on hold for our record results. And actually on a hold-adjusted basis, our EBITDA was up 12% versus 13.1%. Our performance in the second quarter builds upon strong, a strong track record over the last several years. Looking at Slide 7. We have made improvements in the business that positions Caesars well for continued growth. We improved adjusted EBITDAR and margins by nearly $800 million and over 900 basis points, respectively, since 2014 while maintaining the highest standards of customer service and employee engagement. We have deployed over $2 billion of capital across the organization. And we reduced our cost of debt by over 400 basis points. And in the 10 months since completing CEOC's restructuring, this same management team, who was accomplished so much over the past several years, has began to focus on the next phase of growth. We've announced several strategic transactions that expand our network through M&A, development and licensing agreements. Currently, Caesars is implementing an entirely new array of technologies, which includes replacing and modernizing our general ledger, accounts payable system, human capital management system, hotel property management system and our central reservations. We moved our marketing platform to the Salesforce marketing iCloud platform while pursuing a mobile-first strategy and employing modern network infrastructure. And we are pleased to announce that we've been recognized for our leadership in IT by some of the world's most prestigious firms. Caesars Entertainment was recently honored as a CIO 100 award recipient, an award that is more than 30 years old and recognizes organizations around the world that use IT creatively to drive business value. This year, we are the only gaming company and the only Las Vegas-based company to win a CIO 100 award. We are also the only company in our industry to have won the award in the past 10 years. Caesars was also the only gaming company and the only Las Vegas-based company to be named one of the top 100 Best Places to Work in IT by Computerworld in the publication's 25th annual report. Companies are selected based on their ability to challenge their IT team members while providing a great work environment. Receiving these prodigious awards not only highlights our ambitious digital transformation strategy, it showcases accomplishments that will distinguish us in the marketplace for many years to come. Caesars is also working to become one of the most environmentally sustainable companies in the world. We recently announced a commitment to reduce our emissions by 95%. And I'm proud to say we are one of only about 100 companies to have our targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, a partnership between CDP Worldwide, the UN, the World Resources Institute and the World Wildlife Fund, that aims to drive corporate action to combat climate change. Now turning to Slide 8. I'd like to remind you of the 4 cornerstone initiatives which form the foundation of our growth strategy, which we have communicated over the last several years and continue to execute against. We will pursue top line growth by leveraging our superior loyalty and marketing programs and investing in our core gaming business, moving quickly to capitalize on emerging trends. We will continue to refine our efficient operating model. And we will pursue inorganic growth through development, partnerships and acquisitions with a focus on capital discipline. As we continue to advance these initiatives, we are now also starting to focus on our longer-term accelerators, which are introduced on the right side of the slide. We will elaborate more on each accelerator as we make progress on these important elements of our strategic architecture. Last quarter, we spoke in depth about improvements in our marketing and loyalty programs as well as our asset-light licensing strategy. On this call, I'd like to focus on the investments we are making on our gaming business, which will continue to be the growth engine of the company. Recall that Christian Stuart took over as EVP of gaming and interactive entertainment in March of 2017. Under his leadership, our gaming team, which includes personnel from the Caesars interactive entertainment business, has been evolving our game offerings to meet changing consumer demands, take advantage of new sports betting legislation and redefine the future of gaming. With that, please turn to Slide 9. The potential for legal sports betting in the U.S. presents a significant growth opportunity in our industry, following the Supreme Court's recent ruling on PASPA. Some estimate the volume of illegal gambling in the United States to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Caesars Entertainment is at an advantaged position to partner with our state and local regulators to create a safe and responsible sports gaming environment, as we run operations in 14 states and operate a highly successful legal sports wagering business in Nevada, both at properties and on mobile. We are upgrading our digital capabilities to offer the best on-the-go mobile sports betting platform in the market. The Caesars sports app has seen strong early adoption since it launched last year, and the platform now accounts for about 13% of our Nevada sports betting volume. Recent improvements are now live in the app and are driving increased play such as credit card funding and automatic ratings for Total Rewards on sports bet, meaning guests automatically earn Total Rewards points when they bet in the app, and those points can be used across our network. Turning to Slide 10. We are moving quickly to expand our U.S. sports betting business to new locations as it becomes legal and economically attractive to do so. We're partnering with Scientific Games to roll out exciting offerings for guests, beginning with our properties in New Jersey and Mississippi. Scientific Games' digital division will power the Caesars properties with its open bet sports book technology, providing intuitive and sleek solutions for our properties and digital platforms. Open bet has proven successful managing, is successful at managing the largest share of the world's online bets with over 2 billion online bets annually. As of July 30, guests can place convenient and secure sports bets at Bally's, Wild Wild West and Harrah's in Atlantic City. In mid-August, Harrah's Gulf Coast and Horseshoe Tunica in Mississippi will be offering sports betting on premises. And over the course of the next 9 months, we'll continue to upgrade the amenities to establish high energy sports and race book, similar to our best-in-class offering in Las Vegas. We anticipate an increase in ancillary food and beverage and gaming revenues as we expand our physical sports books in both jurisdictions. Moving forward, we also believe sports betting presents a significant opportunity. The mobile Caesars casino and sports app will be live throughout New Jersey later this month, in time with the start of football season. Overtime, we plan to acquire additional talent and technologies to make sure our mobile user interface and trading capabilities are world-class in sports betting. As more states legalize, we will continue to evaluate the best strategy to maximize value for our guests and shareholders, and we'll share updates on our progress. Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to discuss investments we've made in both traditional and innovative new gaming products across our properties to drive revenue and margin growth. Our gaming mix is a key driver of our industry-leading margins. We've continued to refresh our slot product across the enterprise, driving increased customer engagement. We are bringing more in-house innovation to the gaming floor. For example, with the new custom Total Rewards wheel game, which was designed with our VIP guest in mind, the TR wheel has become a very popular, with our VIP guests since we debuted it, and in-house development yields higher returns. Side bets and LINQ aggressive jackpots are other great examples of enhancement we've made to core gaming products, which generate excitement, raise the stakes for guests and increased gaming volume, linking nearly 40 Pai Gow Poker tables across our Las Vegas properties, for example, has driven strong guest interest and results in significantly larger jackpots than one property could drive individually. Caesars is also testing new nontraditional gaming experience to appeal to different customer segments. We're piloting new experiences on the casino floor at The LINQ hotel, which will create an interactive environment allowing guests to game, socialize and be entertained all within one area of the floor. And we are making further investments in eSports with the recent opening of the eSports lounge at the Rio through a third-party partnership with Hybrid One. Following the initial success of the lounge, we plan to expand it to 27,000 square feet, which will make it the largest eSports lounge in Las Vegas by the end of Q3. There were three successful eSports tournaments at Caesars venues in April through June that brought several thousand spectators to the venues and connected the Caesars brand to more than 20 million total online viewers. Our World Series of Poker business also had a great quarter, off-line and online. Following the introduction of shared liquidity in May for Nevada and New Jersey, the business grew 41% year-over-year in New Jersey. Live video coverage of the 49th annual WSOP tournament reached an all-time high. And the tournament established 17 new records, including most entrants and largest price pool ever. On Slide 12, I'd like to quickly highlight another exciting update. We officially broke ground on Caesars Forum during the second quarter. Caesars Forum will be located on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip near Harrah's and The LINQ, two properties with the lowest ratio of meeting space to hotel rooms in our Las Vegas portfolio. The property will include 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space focused around business meetings and will feature the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world with a unique 100,000 square foot outdoor event plaza, unlike anything currently offered in Las Vegas. We're investing an approximately $375 million in development of Caesars Forum and expect to generate substantial incremental revenue. We are seeing a lot of interest in the venue, and we're pleased to say that we've already booked $70 million of business at Caesars Forum. We expect construction to be completed in the back half of 2020. Moving on to Slide 13. We're pleased to have closed the acquisition of Centaur Gaming on July 16, adding Hoosier Park racing and casino in Anderson, Indiana and the Indiana Grand Racing & Casino in Shelbyville, Indiana, to our regional portfolio in addition to three off-track betting facilities. Both Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand feature about 2,000 the latest slots and electronic table games, multiple dining outlets and live and simulcast horseracing. The acquisition extends our Total Rewards network with exciting new destinations that are profitable, well capitalized and highly complementary to our existing portfolio. Pending regulatory approval, we plan to introduce table games in these properties in 2021 to broaden offerings for our guests and drive incremental EBITDAR growth. Within two full years, we expect the properties to generate approximately $200 million in run rate EBITDAR. Integration is off to a great start, with status matching and the ability to transfer points between Centaur's loyalty program and Total Rewards live on day one. By day 100, we expect to have all systems fully integrated with our Total Rewards platform. With that, I'll now turn it over to Eric to discuss the quarterly financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll start on Slide 15. Today's commentary will cover same-store results unless otherwise stated. Same-store commentary include CEOC results and excludes the Horseshoe Baltimore figures from the prior year. Same-store net revenues were up 2.8% year-over-year to $2.12 billion. Las Vegas net revenue was 992 million, up 7.5% year-over-year, driven by both increased gaming volumes and hospitality revenues. Gaming volumes were higher from both table games and slots. New slot products and enhancements to core table games drove the incremental play. Key hospitality metrics grew in line with our expectations, including a 6.7% growth in cash room revenues, 3.6% growth in cash ADR and 3.5% growth in total RevPAR, which was within our anticipated range of 3% to 5%. These positive KPIs were primarily driven by investments in upgrading our hotel rooms in Las Vegas. Las Vegas occupancy was 93.9%, down 160 basis points from the prior year due to a shift in the Las Vegas festival calendar, a lighter convention mix in June and 36,000 more room nights available versus the prior year. Hold positively impacted EBITDAR by approximately $7 million versus prior year, and was $9 million favorable to our expectations. Moving on to the other U.S. regional segment. Revenue grew 0.2%, primarily driven by gaming revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDAR across the other U.S. regional segment increased 9.3%, reflecting exceptional cost management and improvements in marketing efficiency. Regional margins improved 220 basis points, driven by our advances in efficient digital marketing and labor efficiencies. In the all other segment, which includes our managed, international, CIE and corporate areas, revenues declined $14 million to 145 million or 8.8% year-over-year, due to a workers' strike at Caesars Windsor, which temporarily lowered revenue from reimbursed management costs. Increased costs associated with integration and implementation of technology drove our corporate costs up about $4 million, which is in line with the prior quarter and also within our expectations. Noncash interest relating to the financing obligation totaled $45 million. And depreciation expenses associated with the real estate assets transferred to VICI Properties and leased back to CEOC at the emergence, had an impact of $128 million on net income and EPS this quarter. As a reminder, we expect the impact will increase gradually over time, and we have provided an estimate for these expenses for the full year in the appendix to this presentation. Slide 16 provides a high-level overview of our real estate asset sales to VICI and agreements on certain lease amendments. We recently announced the sale of the real estate assets associated with the Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace Las Vegas for 507.5 million in cash. We also have an agreement to sell Harrah's Philadelphia to VICI for 241.5 million. The net proceeds for the Harrah's Philadelphia transaction will be 82.5 million, reflecting the net present value of certain lease modifications. The sales multiples were 14 times future rent of $35 million, plus a property tax modification at the Octavius Tower and 11.5 times future rent of 21 million at Harrah's Philadelphia. Caesars will continue to operate the Octavius Tower and Harrah's Philadelphia under the current terms of the long-term lease agreements relating to those properties. In connection with the closing of the Harrah's Philadelphia transaction, Caesars and VICI will enter into certain lease modifications to both the Caesars Palace and non-Caesars Palace leases. The modifications are intended to bring the lease terms more into alignment with other market precedents and the long-term performance of the properties. The amendments will increase our near-term rent payments to VICI, while reducing volatility in our long-term rent payments and better aligning our economic interests. The modifications also create additional flexibility to support the development of the land on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip by removing certain impediments associated with those plans. We closed the Octavius Tower transaction in mid-July. And the Harrah's Philadelphia transaction and lease modifications are expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and government and third-party approvals. The asset sales and lease amendments support our growth strategy and continue to build on our strong network working relationship with VICI. Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to walk you through our debt, cash and liquidity position and provide an update on our capital allocation strategy. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion in cash enterprise-wide and used approximately $1 billion of this cash, along with the $500 million of proceeds received from the Octavius Tower to purchase Centaur Gaming. Following the close of the Centaur acquisition, our cash balance stood at approximately $1.7 billion, and we have $200 million drawn on our CRC revolver. Cash capital expenditures totaled $130 million in the quarter, driven by extensive renovation that we recently completed at Bally's and the initiation of the second phase of room renovation projects at the Flamingo. Excluding the convertible note and capitalizing on our expected cash lease payments at 8x, our growth leverage stands at approximately 5x our guided EBITDA, sorry, 6x our guided EBITDA. We have a capital allocation plan that ensures we have sufficient capital to continue to invest in our core properties and pursue targeted growth opportunities and also reduce our gross leverage to 4.5x by the end of 2021. Additionally, we executed another $1 billion of swaps in the quarter, increasing our fixed-to-floating ratio starting in 2019 to 60%. At this time, we believe that this was an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt. Through June 30th, the company returned $31 million value to shareholders through repurchasing approximately 2.7 million shares. And as of yesterday, the company has returned approximately $60 million in total value to the shareholders by repurchasing 5.2 million shares. Turning to Slide 18. I'll discuss our outlook. Looking to the third quarter specifically, the group business outlook remains solid, and we expect banquet and hospitality performance to increase. However, we have observed rate pressure in the Las Vegas market impacting our leisure segment and a significant reduction in event programming year-over-year. We currently expect RevPAR to be flat to up 2% in the quarter. At this point in the quarter, we anticipate a negative net collection impact of approximately $10 million year-over-year. We have also budgeted roughly $25 million of impact in the quarter in Atlantic City due to the increased competition. We will continue to monitor the progression of the competitive environment there and any potential offset from the rollout of sports betting. And we'll update everyone on our views in the next earnings call. As a reminder, Atlantic City contributed about $180 million of EBITDAR in 2017, representing approximately 8% of our enterprise-wide EBITDA. For the full year, we continue to target adjusted EBITDAR between $2.37 billion and $2.42 billion. This range does include approximately $40 million of negative impact from the increased competition in Atlantic City, and is updated for the July 16th Centaur closing timing. Despite the rate pressure in the third quarter, we project the fourth quarter will yield double-digit RevPAR growth due to an easy comp year-over-year. Recall that RevPAR growth was flat year-over-year in Q4 2017. We are also maintaining our full year RevPAR growth target of between 4% and 6%. Also, as a reminder, Q4 '17 had unfavorable hold of $15 million. Our CapEx guidance for the year remains unchanged as well. With that, I'll turn it back to Mark for his closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Eric. Please turn to Slide 20. To recap, second quarter results were strong, driven by robust gaming volumes and hospitality revenues in Las Vegas and exceptional cost management. Enterprise-wide EBITDAR grew double digits and adjusted EBITDAR margins expanded 270 basis points. The economic backdrop going into the back half of the year looks positive. Despite the uncertainty with trade, there appears to be no evidence of any impact to hiring decisions, with unemployment near all-time lows. Small business confidence is high, with a near record number of firms planning to increase employment. Part-time workers as a percentage of total unemployment has returned to prerecession levels, particularly amongst millennial's, a key growth driver for our future business. Data also supports steady growth in average weekly earnings, which bodes well for discretionary businesses. Looking ahead, we expect to accelerate our momentum in 2018 through continued investments in our properties and room product, potential upside for expanding our sports betting business across the U.S., and potential additional international development projects and licensing opportunities, while maintaining capital discipline and periodically returning cash to shareholders. So we'll now open up the line for Q&A. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with JPMorgan. Dan Politzer : So obviously you guys just guided to RevPAR for the 3Q of flat to 2%. I just wanted to make sure, one, I heard that right; and two, as far as it relates to your full year guidance of 4% to 6%, I guess, can you kind of frame out where we should get the confidence that obviously that implies up mid-teens in 4Q at the very least? And I guess, what's your line of sight there? Eric Hession : Yes. Dan, this is Eric. That's correct. The full year guidance that we maintained between the 4% and 6% does include the weakened expectation that we have in the third quarter of between 0 and 2%. Heading into the fourth quarter, we do continue to see strong group pickup, and we also continue to see solid bookings. If you recall, due to the unfortunate tragedy, the market experienced last year a significant decline in the pace that we are growing in terms of the RevPAR. And as a result, the comp in the fourth quarter is the easiest of the year. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just on your EBITDAR guidance. Obviously the 2Q was pretty strong. I mean, as we, how should we think about the guidance for the back of the year as it relates to the marketing efficiencies across the regional properties, and then, obviously on The Strip as it relates to your ongoing room renovations? Eric Hession : Yes. In terms of the EBITDAR guidance, again, we had what we felt were very strong second quarter results. The third quarter, as we commented, had some declining performance on the leisure side. And in particular, there was a lack of programming in the city due to a number of events that didn't occur year-over-year. However, for a full year basis, we decided to keep our EBITDAR guidance the same. And from a margin standpoint, we continue to expect to have improved margins particularly on the back of the great performance that we did in the second quarter. From a marketing standpoint, we did reduce our marketing spend by about $35 million or around 7% on a year-over-year basis. And we anticipate continuing with that trajectory going forward into the back half of the year. Mark Frissora : Yes, I would also at that in the fourth quarter is where we started the marketing cut last year. So on a year-over-year basis, the increase on improvement weren't anticipated to be as great as they were in the first three quarters, given that those cuts anniversary out in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Eric, maybe just stick with the same, kind of the same question, but as we dig in a little deeper on the guidance, so you're running roughly up 1% to 2% for the first half, maybe a little less than that. And then you're guiding zero to 2% for the third quarter. So the obvious question here is what kind of acceleration you would need to get to even the low end of a 4% to 6% for the fourth quarter? And then also, just a question mark around sort of what kind of visibility do you really think you would have in your RevPAR outlook if it sounds like close-in or late-breaking business is not materializing maybe the way you thought it was a month or two ago? So could you sort of elaborate on those points, sort of how mechanically or mathematically you could hit even a 4%? And then, and again, like what kind of visibility you have in this number? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. So mathematically, I believe to answer your question directly, to hit 4%, we need around 11% year-over-year RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, given the 0% to 2% in the third quarter. And we are projecting to be at that level or better heading into the fourth quarter. The main issue that we saw in the third quarter was really in the first two months of the quarter with respect to the lack of programming and some of the rate pressure that we've been seeing on the FIT side. We don't see that occurring in the fourth quarter. And the programming for the city appears to be much stronger both on that standpoint, but also on the group side. Mark Frissora : And we are seeing positive momentum in September. So that's something that is, obviously, we have numbers that kind of indicate year-over-year what kind of a demand that we have on both rate as well as volume. So, but obviously, in July as well as August, we saw some softening, which, again, caused us to be cautious about how we provide guidance and how we think about RevPAR as well. Shaun Kelley : And just to be clear, I mean, from where we were, let's say, in the beginning of May, July and August, did they materially deteriorate from what you were seeing when you kind of like last provided your outlook? I mean, are we looking at something that's quite different then you probably were thinking about then? Mark Frissora : Yes. That's correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Wanted to move on to capital allocation. Last quarter, you announced the buyback in the quarter. You spent a little bit there. You've had the announcement on tendering for the converts also in the quarter. And you highlighted in your prepared remarks, you had some asset sales at pretty attractive multiples. So given where your equity is trading, given the existing converts that are out there, kind of all these things that have probably gone through your head in the past couple of months, is there an updated view on what to do with the cash? I believe you noted in the presentation 1.75 billion after Centaur. Eric Hession : Yes, sure. It's a good question. We did enter into a 10b5 grid based program shortly after making the announcement of the buybacks and putting out our earnings. And so if you recall, those occurred in May. So we didn't have a full quarter of time to execute the purchasing repurchase program. We did note that we bought back about 2.5 million shares in the month of July when that program was fully operating. And the expectations are to continue to repurchase shares throughout the year, and also to complete the conversion of the convert, which we'll plan to do early this coming quarter. Chad Beynon : And then you noted that you're at 60% of rooms renovated in Vegas. Also, in your presentation, there's a couple TBDs in there. Is that mainly driven off of just how you're thinking about capital? Or is that to be determined simply because of what you've seen lately in Vegas? And if you continue to see some pressure on the leisure side, maybe it's better to push the money elsewhere, and you won't get the returns that you've talked about on the renovated rooms. Just some color on that would be helpful as well. Eric Hession : No. At this point, we haven't changed our plan on the room renovations. It's really just a sequencing in terms of where we think the right pattern is and how many rooms we want to have out at any one time. We completed Bally's, as we noted, which was a large project, 1,950 rooms. And then we've started another 1,000-room project at The Flamingo. Later in the year and into next year, our big project will be Paris. And then we'll finish the final tower at Harrah's. So all of those are still kind of on pace, as anticipated. We do shift them by a few weeks or months, depending on the various schedules and the construction timing. But broadly speaking, that is consistent with our anticipated plan. And as we mentioned, we do anticipate the pace to ramp down because we are finishing the renovations of the cycle. But also, as we've provided guidance from a capital perspective, we do expect our capital spending to be reduced each year going forward as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : How well booked are you? What's your booking pace in the fourth quarter? I think that now that the cat's out of the bag on this, on the third quarter, going into this third quarter, you had a great deal of confidence about the third quarter. So is it not possible that, to the extent that you're not particularly well booked in the fourth quarter, that we could be running into the same issue in the fourth quarter? Mark Frissora : No. I don't think, first of all, I think we know what the bookings look like through the end of the year. And so we don't have concern in our forecast. And so when you say the cat's out of the bag, we said that we saw some weakness in July and August, but then strengthening in September. So again in this business model, at least as it relates to Vegas, everything swings over several months. It's not like you look at 1 month or 2 months, and you say, oh, that's it for Vegas, right? That's not the way it works. I mean, I've seen this over and over again over the last 3.5 years I've been here. There's a knee-jerk reaction oftentimes for a momentary weakness. This is not, it's just a programming issue. It's not that we have a weakness in Vegas. So I want to be clear, it's not weakness in Vegas. It's a programming issue. And when you look at the number of events that are held at various venues throughout The Strip and you compare that year-over-year, we understand why the weaknesses is there in July and August. So this is not some reason to panic or think Vegas is weak. It's a reason to explain why it ended up being weaker than we anticipated. However, we didn't change our guidance, and we have strong operating performance, and the margins are higher year-over-year. So I feel like, like I said, there is nothing new here, other than the fact there's a little lapse over a 2-month period due to programming. So we understand the root cause of it and again, making everyone aware of it. So I still think Vegas is a very strong market that has strong fundamentals. I mean, if we look at our increase year-over-year, it was significant on a same-store basis, both in profit and revenue. And again, we don't anticipate some kind of a fallout in any way, shape or form. Eric, you want to add to that? Eric Hession : No, only to say that the group bookings are very strong in Q4. So that gives us the incremental confidence because that business is quite solid. As we mentioned, the group booking were up in Q3, but not to the extent that we're seeing it in Q4. Harry Curtis : Why don't we just quickly move on then to the Atlantic City market? It sounds like, maybe you can provide some color on performance since Hard Rock and Ocean Place opened. And is it making you feel more or less confident about your initial thoughts, say, 3 months ago or 6 months ago of how that market would unfold for, say, the coming 12 months? Eric Hession : Yes, I would say, it's a little too early to draw conclusions at this point. They've only been open about a month. We kept our full year guidance the same. And so the expectations really haven't changed in terms of what we expect the impact to be. We're continuing to monitor it, as you saw with the traffic counts coming into Atlantic City, it does appear that the properties are driving incremental visitation. And whether that's a onetime event as people try out the new properties or whether that's going to continue, will determine ultimately what the impact is. But I don't think we know at this point what the eventful impact would be to any degree really differently than what we had originally provided in our guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Kayler with Bank of America. James Kayler : Just changing gears a little bit from the balance sheet perspective. Maybe just give us a little more perspective in the 4.5x leverage target and like this, the 2021 target. Just curious how you're thinking about sort of balancing bringing down leverage versus returning capital to shareholders. And I think related to that, have you given any more consideration to simplifying the balance sheet, combining the subsidiaries? Eric Hession : Yes. What we've done is obviously projected our cash availability over the horizon. We've identified what we think is a core amount of capital that we need to reinvest in the business, and we've provided directional guidance to everybody on that. Then we've also looked at potential acquisitions and the amount of capital that would be needed there as well as a repurchase plan. And then balance that with the growth in the core business, providing deleveraging as well as allocating some of the available cash to repurchase debt through the market or through re-financing's. And so we think that 4.5x is a solid level to be at for the company. And it's one that we can achieve over this period of time while keeping a balanced reinvestment profile for the other areas that are needed to grow the company. With respect to your second question on simplification, yes, there are two main areas that we're looking at now. One, as you're aware, is the convert and reducing the amount of convert that's out there. And the other we've alluded to in terms of merging CEOC and CRC, that's still on our plan. And I would expect that we would try to pursue that either late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies David Katz : I wanted to, and I know that this is a horse that's getting beaten considerably, but I think it's important to just go back to the 3Q, 4Q cadence. And let me just begin by saying that good quarter, congratulations, it was impressive. But if we can go back to the 3Q, 4Q cadence a little bit and just talk about what we would or should have been expecting in terms of comps in the third quarter, because we knew that Mayweather-McGregor was last year, is an event that was fairly major. What else can we put in that bucket that is sort of driving that outcome? And obviously the ease of 4Q comps, I think, you've discussed and is fairly clear. So if we could maybe beat that horse a bit more, I'd appreciate it. Eric Hession : Yes. I'd start off by saying from a guidance perspective, we maintained our RevPAR guidance that we set at the beginning of the year. We maintained our EBITDA guidance that we set at the beginning of the year. And we maintained our capital guidance that we set at the beginning of the year. So from our perspective, the performance of the company is operating within the guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year. And the end position, where we think we'll end up at the end of the year, is going to be within those three ranges. So in terms of the third quarter, in particular, it is weaker than we had originally anticipated, and there were a number of events that changed between quarters. Mark Frissora : Yes. So if I can just add, I mean, so when look at entertainment programming on a year-over-year basis, the largest volume-driving venues, net there was a reduction of 21 shows at the T-Mobile Arena. 21 shows is a fairly significant number. And then seven fewer, including the Mayweather-McGregor fight in August of 2017. And so just that alone generated a lot of incremental revenues for us last year from a programming standpoint. So you can see, I just gave you some numbers. I mean, that's a huge difference. And again, I can get more detailed, maybe if you want to, off the call. But there was a very large difference in programming which is what's driving the softness. So I think that we have good news is that we're going to have an improvement in the fourth quarter. So again, this is a two month blip that ends up improving, getting back on pace, which is kind of what our guidance indicated to you. So again, there's no cause for concern. But there is a momentary in Vegas when you see programming changes like this, you will see volumes drop off the facilities. And that's just the way the business rolls. So it's not a cause of concern. It's just what I call something cyclical within the quarter. David Katz : Right. I know those 21 shows were in the third quarter last year that you referenced? Mark Frissora : Yes, net reduction of 21 shows at the T-Mobile Arena, okay? And then in addition to that, we had the seven fewer, including the Mayweather-MacGregor fight in August of 2017, which doesn't repeat itself. And just in that venue alone, that fight alone, we generated significant amount of revenues and profit off of it. So you lose that as well as the number of programs, it ends up having a softening effect, a dampening effect. But again, a temporary effect. Not a long-term effect, a temporary effect. No reason for anyone to overreact to it. David Katz : Right. So if I may follow that up. I think in your opening remarks, there was some reference to rate pressure on the leisure side. And one of the dynamics, I think, everyone has started to look a bit more closely at is the inclusion or resort fees and their inclusion being a driver of RevPAR. Could you just elaborate a bit more on what you were referencing there in terms of rate pressure on the leisure side? Mark Frissora : Well, I would say that when you do, when you look at every single week, every competitor and how their rates are set, obviously, there are certain entities on The Strip that have more rate pressure than others. They set the umbrella for a lot of properties. So you have different segmentations that are occurring. And so we can't predict what rates will be set or what demand will be perfectly, and so there are people on The Strip that are obviously pricing rates at a lower level and we can't control that. And so in order for us to keep our occupancy up, we obviously have to meet competition. So this is all about looking at everything, for example, on The Strip and determining what the optimal strategy is for the profit of the company. That's what we do every day. So when we see a rate pressure, it means that there are certain entities, and I don't call out competitors on any call, that's for the competitors to discuss and for you guys to look at the rates. But bottom line is we had some rate pressure from similar competitors. And we had, in some cases, matched that and had some softness that we were predicting in the third quarter. David Katz : If I can ask one last question on a different topic, which is that you focused, and I know you've made some reference to some of the technology investments that you've made. Can you talk about the degree to which that is a profit driver, and specifically, the discourse in the industry on promotional expenditures and the efficiencies of that? The margin growth that you're getting, how much of that is driven by the technology and its impact on marketing and promotions? Mark Frissora : Yes, I don't see we have a precision answer to that for you. But I can tell you that the impact of technology going forward in the company, it will be more significant than it is today. So our margins will actually expand through our technology adoption going forward. The margins that we have today are driven in permanent. They're not temporary, right? So our margins are driven by labor productivity and marketing efficiency, and we still think we have room to grow. So those two factors will continue. And then we have growth now with the Centaur acquisition and realization of the synergies there. We have a lot of other projects, both initiatives in place. But we want to make sure that those growth initiatives, we'll talk about them when they're firm and settled. We do have Dubai, which is an exciting, two facilities opening up actually, Caesars and Caesars Palace, in the fourth quarter, which will help us generate incremental EBITDA. And we have our many, many other projects that we'll be unfolding. But again, we're just out of bankruptcy. I think it's important for everyone to know that, that was October of last year. And the shares are held by a lot of people, an awful lot of people that don't plan on holding them long term. So I think we see temporary weakness from wherever we have strength. We announced a strong quarter, and I think when you see the reaction, a lot of it's built on a lot of people in the stock that aren't in it for the long haul. And we have very high percentage of our shares held by, what I would term, fast money and much higher than normal. Most companies would have, I'll say, 25%. Roughly we have almost 80% of our shares held. So this is an important fact you probably want to remember when we look at the pressure in the shares today, for example. And I think this is a temporary blip that this is a buying opportunity obviously for everyone. And certainly, it's a time in the company where we're actually performing at record highs. And we have record initiatives on our plate that will allow us to even improve more. So I'm excited for the prospects of the company. And for those investors who stick with us, they won't be disappointed. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, please continue. Joyce Arpin : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining. We'll talk to you on the next call. Operator : Thank you to all our participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes your webcast. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

We also deconsolidated the results of the Horseshoe Baltimore in the third quarter of 2017 and closed on the acquisition of Centaur Gaming in the third quarter of 2018. Therefore, U.S. GAAP results do not include CEOC in Q3 2017, but include Horseshoe Baltimore in Q3 2017 and include Centaur in Q3 2018. Enterprise-wide results include CEOC in the prior year and include Centaur in the current year, but exclude the Horseshoe Baltimore in both years unless otherwise stated. Enterprise-wide holds-adjusted results reflect hold versus our expectation. You can find reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP figures starting on slide 37. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please turn to Slide 6. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Joyce. As most of your read in our press release this afternoon, we announced that I will be leaving the company on February 8. It's been an honor to serve as the CEO of Caesars since 2015, particularly given all that this management team has accomplished to transform the company during that period. I'm very grateful to the entire team for their efforts and proud of what we've accomplished together and very optimistic about our company's future. I plan to remain focused on operating discipline and maintaining stability during the transition. So now we'll turn to the operating results. We reported third quarter enterprise-wide revenues of nearly $2.2 billion, up 2.9% from the prior year quarter despite headwinds in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and a very challenging year-over-year comparison. The increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Centaur and strong performance across our diversified regional portfolio, excluding Atlantic City. Note that we had a very strong Q3 2017, which benefited from favorable items, including a credit and bad debt expense and we also had unfavorable hold versus our expectations this quarter. Taking these items into consideration, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. Outside of Las Vegas, we realized an 8.4% increase in revenue and a 10.7% increase in adjusted EBITDAR for our other U.S. properties, despite the increased competition in Atlantic City. Excluding the acquisition of Centaur and the impact in Atlantic City, adjusted EBITDAR growth would have been 3%, demonstrating the continued broad-based strength across our regional portfolio and momentum in our operational efficiency efforts. In Las Vegas, revenues fell 2.4%, attributable to soft demand. Adjusted EBITDAR declined 7.5% impacted by unfavorable hold of $10 million to $15 million year-over-year as well as higher collections than normal in the prior year period, resulting in $11 million of increased bad debt expense year-over-year. As a result, adjusted EBITDAR margin compressed by 190 basis points in Las Vegas. Adjusting for these two factors, Las Vegas adjusted EBITDAR would remain flat year-over-year. Our results validate the strength of our business model and ability to execute despite these calendar-driven headwinds. Enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDAR of $600 million declined 2.1% driven by softness in Las Vegas as well as a drag from Atlantic City. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $616 million, down 2.7% year-over-year. As we described on our last call, the third quarter of 2017 was a record quarter for our Las Vegas a schedule and our target gaming customer mix was meaningfully lighter this quarter on a year-over-year basis. With that said, another aspect of our enterprise-wide performance in the quarter was reflected in the benefits of our geographically diversified network and continued focus on operational excellence as results and regional markets partially offset the softness in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Our enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDAR margin declined 140 basis points to 27.5% compared to an all-time record third quarter adjusted EBITDAR margin in the prior year period. Marketing improvements and efficiency efforts remained a key focus over the quarter. We reduces domestic marketing cost by $146 million year-to-date, while holding market share in Las Vegas and most of our regional jurisdictions. Year-to-date domestic marketing cost now represent just 20% of our gross revenues, reflecting 200 basis point reduction year-over-year. Hold was $15 million to $20 million below normalized level. Despite quarter-over-quarter volatility in our business, we remain focused on executing our strategic priorities to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. I'm proud of the company's execution on third quarter. We manage the business well in the face of softer than anticipated demand in Las Vegas. Within the quarter, we had several important wins. Regionally, results were strong with other U.S. enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDAR growing 10.7% or 3%, excluding Centaur and the impact of increased competition in Atlantic City. We successfully closed the Centaur acquisition in July and integration is progressing ahead of schedule. We managed EBITDAR margins well despite revenue declines in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. We launched new sports betting offerings in Mississippi and New Jersey. We plan to open Caesars Dubai on November 15, demonstrating our ability to leverage our brands and organizational assets to grow cash flows in a very capital-efficient way. And we returned cash to shareholders through $311 million in share repurchases this year-to-date. There were some notable challenges in the quarter, too, many of which we have already discussed on recent investor events. Demand in Las Vegas was softer than we anticipated based on our pace in the quarter and historical trends and dropped sharply in the back half of September. Despite the strong Hotel and Casino performance we had in the second quarter, we were surprised how quickly demand deteriorated through the end of Q3. When demand fell off in September, we took actions to improve occupancy and EBITDAR by utilizing our casino database. Las Vegas RevPAR came in below our expectations. Eric will discuss RevPAR later in the call. Our analysis indicates that the third quarter softness in Las Vegas was temporary and we are already seeing strong momentum in bookings for the fourth quarter and early into 2019. And we were impacted by increased competition in Atlantic City in the quarter, as discussed on our prior earnings call. As you will see on Slide 8, we haven't updated our outlook for the full year, due to the softer-than-expected third quarter results in Vegas. We now expect enterprise-wide hold-adjusted EBITDAR for the full year between $2.32 billion and $2.37 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4% to 6%. We still expect a strong fourth quarter and our guidance implies enterprise-wide hold-adjusted revenue of approximately $2.06 billion to $2.14 billion and hold-adjusted EBITDAR of approximately $550 million to $600 million in the fourth quarter or year-over-year growth of 4% to 8% and 6% to 16%, respectively. Revenues from our in-house groups and citywide group business remains solid, which implies increased hotel revenues year-over-year. We're also filling more rooms with casino customers early in the booking window, which will improve gaming revenues and hedge against any potential volatility in late booking and leisure demand. As of now, we have approximately 100,000 total additional Las Vegas room nights on the books in the fourth quarter versus the same time last year, reflecting an increase of 7% at this time. Also as a reminder, we had a negative EBITDAR impact of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the tragic event on October 1, 2017. We also had $15 million in unfavorable hold versus expectations in Q4 '17. Finally, we expect to have approximately 40,000 room nights on the market year-over-year due to renovations. In other U.S. regions, we budgeted roughly $20 million of adjusted EBITDAR impact in the fourth quarter in Atlantic City due to the increased capacity there. We have seen a decrease in revenue since the peak period and are maintaining our $40 million adjusted EBITDAR impact for the second half of the year. All other areas remain stable and consistent with the first 3 quarters of this year. In the all other segment, we expect adjusted EBITDAR to remain in line with the first, second and third quarters of this year. Let's move to Slide 9. Taking a step back from the results, we made further progress on our growth initiatives and we're confident we have the right strategies in place to drive sustainable value creation over the long-term. We're taking a balanced approach to capital allocation across the investment in - across investment in our properties, debt reduction, disciplined M&A and share repurchases. We are expanding our footprint with accretive acquisitions and asset-light licensing opportunities and we're broadening our product offerings in areas like sports betting and areas where we under-index versus peer such as corporate meetings. Our industry-leading Total Rewards program, now with over 55 million members, continues to drive cross-property visitation and a fair share revenue premium in most regions where we operate, making us an advantaged acquirer of regional assets. Our technology investments across the company have helped us draw increasingly valuable customer insights from the database, allowing us to generate strong returns in our marketing investments and drive growth in our core business. On Slide 10. Our operational excellence and continuous improvement efforts have accelerated our ability to realize synergies at Centaur through the full turnover to our systems, which is expected to occur this month at those properties. The results of Centaur validate our thesis that we can utilize the power of the Total Rewards database and our efficient and scalable operating model to drive traffic and synergies for future M&A. We continue to project that we will drive $200 million of EBITDAR at these properties in 2 full years. It's also worth reiterating that we funded the purchase of Centaur in part from the proceeds of our sale of the real estate assets of Harrah's Las Vegas to VICI Properties. As shown in the table, we anticipate our effective post-synergy OpCo multiple to be approximately 5.7x and to be further reduced to 4.8x upon the introduction of table games. We will update you as we continue to integrate the properties. Slide 11. Caesars Entertainment's unique platform is also a key competitive advantage as we look towards the future of sports betting. During the quarter, we launched new sports betting offerings in New Jersey and Mississippi, which saw strong guest traffic and a 10% to 20% increase in revenues at adjacent bars, restaurants and gaming properties. We launched a mobile betting app in New Jersey, which is fully integrated with Total Rewards and caesarscasino.com, which saw a 20% increase in September as customers played between products. We recently added sports bonusing features to the app and bolstered our partnership with SG Digital with the addition of a larger sports operations and marketing team located in Gibraltar. With these actions, we expect to drive increased volume from the initial launch period beginning in November. And at the LINQ in Las Vegas, we opened The Book, a more modern and social take on the traditional sports book, which has been well received and has driven double F&B revenue in October versus the prior year. We believe we're uniquely positioned to compete as sports betting expands to other states such as Pennsylvania, where we received an initial license yesterday due to our strong brands, distribution model, investments in technology and partnerships and footprint across 14 states. We expect sports betting to become an increasingly important component of our overall business in the future. As part of our broad-based efforts to raise our profile with sports fans, we recently announced several high-level partnerships with pro sports teams and venues. Here in Las Vegas, we're proud to be one of the first corporate sponsorship - sponsored partners with the Las Vegas Raiders and we're excited for the imminent arrival. On the East Coast, we're branding the lounge the Prudential Center and are working closely with the Devils and the 76ers to have our branding and experiences present at all of their home games. In Baltimore, our relationship with the Baltimore Ravens, who play just a few blocks from our Horseshoe property, is also core to our local and national marketing strategy. On Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, we under-index compared to peers in revenue we get from corporate meetings. This is why the construction of Caesars Forum is such a great opportunity to diversify and expand our business into areas with significant upside potential. According to Carlson Wagonlit Travel, Las Vegas will be the number 1 destination for hosting meetings in 2019. There is more demand for meeting space in Las Vegas than we can currently accommodate. In fact, our meeting spaces at Caesars run at 90% capacity outside of holiday weeks, demonstrating the potential upside from adding additional capacity. We're investing approximately $375 million in the development of Caesars Forum and expect to generate substantial incremental revenue. We're already seeing strong interest in the venue and we're pleased to say that we've already booked $112 million of business at Caesars Forum. We expect construction to be completed in early 2020. So on Slide 14, the improvements we're making in our operating model will drive significant value in the future. In the first 9 months of 2018, we've increased our net revenue per full-time employee 4% and reduce our domestic marketing cost by $146 million, primarily through targeted reinvestment strategies, which have sharpened our ability to offer the right incentives to guests at the right times, while reducing nonaccretive offers. We've been successful in ensuring that rebalancing our marketing spend does not impact profitable market share or the customer experience. Despite the decreases in marketing and labor expenses, we've achieved record Net Promoter and customer satisfaction scores from our guests during the last 3 years. In the first 9 months, we saw a 2.8% increase in our Net Promoter Score and a 5.1% increase in customer service scores from our guests. Moving to Slide 15, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation and we have multiple avenues by which we are creating shareholder value. After using cash for rent, interest, maintenance capital and same-store growth projects, we plan to utilize our remaining free cash flow to reduce debt, pursue disciplined and accretive M&A, pursue new development activities and repurchase shares. Importantly, we anticipate that any acquisitions we make will be neutral or deleveraging post synergies. Debt paydown is an important priority at this time to derisk the balance sheet and provide dry powder for opportunistic deployment. We remain committed to reduce our gross lease adjusted leverage to 4.5x and our gross financial leverage to 3.25x by the end of 2021. We believe our shares are undervalued and will continue to repurchase them as we are able to under the current $750 million authorization. That we think our shares are undervalued even if they are worth what our consensus price target of $13 suggest deploying the remaining $439 million authorized under our program will yield $0.30 per share of value uplift, which is attractive, but there may be better alternatives. We are focused on generating multiple dollars per share of incremental value through sustainable free cash flow and EBITDAR growth in multiple expansion. Thus, we will ship dynamically about those capital allocation priorities to be responsive to varying market and economic conditions as well as our evaluation. Given our aspirations for value creation and the opportunities we are seeing, we're currently most focused on debt reduction and disciplined M&A to increase our trading multiple and drive long-term value for shareholders. Sale-leaseback are another tool at our disposal to create value. They can be an efficient source of capital and as you saw with the Centaur deal, can be used to finance accretive expansion opportunities. We'll continue to evaluate sale-leasebacks in the context of all the other opportunities available to us and we'll keep you updated on our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Eric to review our financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. Before I discuss the details on our segment results, I'd like to start on Slide 17 to discuss RevPAR and specifically detail the drivers of our Q3 RevPAR decline of $4 or 3.6%. As you see in the waterfall chart, the RevPAR weaknesses is primarily attributable to lower rate in occupancy due to weak demand in the leisure segment driven by fewer citywide events year-over-year. In addition, we took inventory off of a key online travel agency as we negotiated better contract terms, which will positively impact EBITDAR for the long term, but negatively affect RevPAR this quarter. In response to the unexpected weaker leisure demand, we leveraged our large gaming loyalty database to fill rooms with casino customers. Because of the lead time associate with this strategy, most of the improvement impacted, Q4 but we saw some benefit in September as well. In addition, annualization of resort fees also had a positive impact on RevPAR of about $1.60. Now turning to Slide 18, let's review our results for the third quarter in more detail. As in quarter past, our commentary includes CEOC results but excludes Horseshoe Baltimore from the prior year. Starting in the third quarter, Centaur is included in our results. First in Las Vegas, as Mark noted, it was a challenging quarter primarily driven by lower casino volumes, unfavorable hold and lower occupancy given weaker than anticipated demand and a very difficult comparison versus last year's robust event calendar. Overall, Las Vegas net revenue totaled $910 million, down 2.4% versus the prior year period. Hospitality results were soft, driven by lower occupancy rates in the leisure segment. As a result, overall Las Vegas cash room revenue fell 5.5% and RevPAR as noted fell 3.6%. Cash ADR in Las Vegas was down 2% versus last year. Gaming results in Las Vegas were also softer than expected, down 9.8% from a year ago, due to lower volumes and unfavorable hold. Turning to our U.S. regional segment. Revenues grew 8.4% and adjusted EBITDAR grew 10.7%, driven primarily by the acquisition of Centaur and broad-based strength at our regional properties outside of Atlantic City. The impact in Atlantic City due to higher competition negatively impacted hold-adjusted EBITDAR by approximately $20 million versus 1 year ago. In the all other segment, which includes our managed, international, CIE and corporate areas, revenues remained essentially flat, while adjusted EBITDAR decreased $18 million year-over-year due to a credit related to IT corporate costs and lower than normal insurance expense in the prior year period due to large claims that settled significantly slower than reserved. We provided a breakdown of our results by owned versus leased assets in the appendix. RevPAR is one of the many indicators we use to measure our progress. We're pleased to say that we have outperformed our Strip peers in year-over-year RevPAR growth by an average of 300 basis points over the last 10 quarters. As we head into the fourth quarter, we're seeing solid RevPAR growth, particularly in October. Competitive dynamics in Las Vegas make RevPAR difficult for us to forecast as it's influenced by many factors. First, we operate fewer than 25% of the rooms on The Strip due to our database sell - and we sell even lower percentage of rooms in the leisure segment. Therefore, our rates are affected by competitive factors. Second, approximately 40% of our room nights are comprised of casino customers and our comps are discounted. Effective January 1 of this year, changes to our revenue recognition policy caused our comp room rates to be determined by a discounted component of our leisure rate. Because of this dynamic, RevPAR has become more volatile and can be negatively impacted in a soft market. The bar chart on the right-hand side of this page shows the month-over-month volatility of our Las Vegas RevPAR. Our goal is to create shareholder value - value for our shareholders. To that end, we believe that adjusted EBITDAR is the most important measure of our enterprise-wide performance. For the reasons mentioned, RevPAR has many influencing factors and at times, we may take actions to improve other metrics at the expense of RevPAR. So we've decided to stop providing RevPAR guidance going forward and will, of course, continue to disclose RevPAR results each quarter for the benefit of the investing community. Turning to Slide 19. I'd like you - to walk you through our debt, cash and liquidity position. As we ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash enterprise-wide, we also currently have $100 million drawn on our CRC revolver. Both cash and revolver balance is reflected in the purchase of Centaur. Cash capital expenditures totaled $127 million in the quarter, driven by ongoing renovations in the second phase of our room refresh project at Flamingo. Excluding the convertible note and capitalizing on our new expected cash lease payments at 8x, our net leverage stands at approximately 5.4x our new outlook for adjusted EBITDAR and our net traditional leverage is at 4x adjusted EBITDAR. Recall last quarter, we executed another $1 billion of swaps, increasing our fixed to floating ratio starting in 2019 to 60%. At this time, we believe this is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. Through September 30, the company returned $311 million of value to shareholders through repurchasing approximately 31 million shares. We stopped buying back shares midway through the quarter and through our quiet period. We continue to believe their shares are an attractive use of capital and plan to buy back shares opportunistically as we are allowed. Turning to slide 20, we'd like to provide you an illustrative view of our expected discretionary cash flows in the coming years. Taking the midpoint of our full year guidance plus the fully integrated run rate adjusted EBITDAR for Centaur, we'd expect to generate about $270 million in discretionary cash flow after maintenance CapEx, lease payments and interest expenses. We continue to expect healthy cash flows, which will enable us to invest in our core business, reduce our leverage, pursue disciplined M&A and repurchase shares as Mark explained, according to our capital allocation strategy. Now I'll turn it back to Mark for some closing comments. Mark Frissora : Thanks a lot, Eric. On Slide 22. So coming back to our full year outlook for a moment, note that we are slightly lowering our CapEx guidance with same-store at $500 million to $550 million, which includes our room renovations. Development CapEx is at $250 million to $275 million, which includes Caesars Forum, Korea and the Centaur integration. The development CapEx range was lowered as spend at Caesars Forum shifted more into 2019 from 2018. Slide 23, turning to the fourth quarter specifically. As I mentioned, we are seeing good momentum in Las Vegas. In October, we generated one of the highest monthly hotel revenue results in the history of the company. We had 50,000 additional casino room nights on the books versus the same time last year and we're seeing solid growth in our VIP and VVIP segments, all important indicators of performance. Our Total Rewards gaming database and unique distribution model is a significant competitive advantage that we can use to drive increases in casino room nights, which reduces our reliance on the leisure segment. Looking further out to 2019, our business is healthy. We already have 90% of our target room nights booked for in-house groups. Overall room nights in the books for January 2019 are up by approximately 28,000 versus the same time last year. We expect positive ADR growth in Las Vegas and Caesars Bluewaters Dubai will be fully operational and generating fees as well as Buena Vista, opening in the second quarter. To recap, we remain confident in delivering value to our shareholders through our continued operational focus and disciplined growth strategy. On Slide 25, there is a summary of progress on some of our key strategic objectives. In the 13 months since CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy, we have continued to focus on cash flow margins, while gradually shifting investments towards long-term growth initiatives. We're expanding the Caesars Entertainment network through accretive MNA, Las Vegas real estate development, international development and asset light branding and licensing opportunities with a focus on capital discipline. We have also prioritized investments in innovation in our core gaming business to attract new demographics and capitalize on emerging trends, including building out our U.S. sports betting business where Caesars is extremely well positioned to compete. We are well positioned to generate sustainable top- and bottom-line growth through our successful and disciplined execution of these initiatives. In summary, we are successfully executing on the plan that we set out at emergence and we have a clear path forward to creating significant shareholder value. We remain focused on executing against these growth areas in a disciplined manner. We're now ready to open up the line for Q&A, operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli. You may ask your question. Carlo Santarelli : Congratulations on a great job with the company through the bankruptcy up until the present. Just in terms of the commentary on Las Vegas, I guess, there is a little bit of - I guess, from your comments, obviously, there were a couple of one timers in the 3Q and some of the changes that you made around the way you're addressing some of the FIT business as well as some of the wholesale and group business and obviously, that's - more of that will be on the com when you do get the Caesars Convention Center open. But Eric, maybe you could talk a little bit about just some of the nuances of some of those changes and how the moving parts all come together to kind of serve as a little bit of headwind to RevPAR growth? Eric Hession : As we mentioned at a few of the investor conferences throughout the third quarter, we were clearly surprised by the falloff in the pace of that leisure demand segment. One of our largest competitive advantages is the sizable database that we have. And the database is most effective when used out looking a few months ahead in terms of being able to market to those customers. So we tried to do that in the middle of the third quarter. And as Mark mentioned in his notes, we did affect a little bit of the September month. However, unfortunately, our occupancy fell overall because we weren't able to backfill with those casino customers. When we look into fourth quarter, and even into next year, utilizing the database has been very effective. We have 100,000 more room nights on the book at this point compared to the prior year period and over half of those are from the casino segment. So that is certainly providing us with optimism regarding the strength of the quarter. In addition, we finished the October month where we saw October finishing either as the best or the second best hotel revenue month ever in the history of the company. So the fourth quarter is shaping up quite well. And then as we head into 2019, the group demand also seems quite strong. We have significant percentage of the anticipated rooms already on the books, well over 90% and they're at solid rates that would indicate further strength in the Las Vegas market. Carlo Santarelli : And obviously, Eric, as you mentioned, that casino customer impact, just given the way the accounting works on the optical way that you'd report RevPAR, would obviously have a negative influence, correct? Eric Hession : Yes, so the casino room nights because of the way revenue recognition was changed at the beginning of this year, we book the casino room nights at a discount to one of our transient segments. And so as a result, if we are trading rooms from that segment, casino segment, it would drive down RevPAR. To the extent that we're actually increasing occupancy, it would be a good side of the ledger, but when you're making that trade-off to the casino rooms, it does cause it to decline. In addition, in this case, in Q4, we also have approximately 40,000 more rooms available to sell than we did in the prior year period due to the schedule of the renovations, which that certainly provides downward pressure on the RevPAR calculation, but obviously an opportunity to have incremental revenues by filling rooms with profitable customers. Carlo Santarelli : And then Mark, if I just could ask one follow-up. In your remarks, you talked a little bit about uses of capital going forward and obviously, debt paydown was one of the focus, but you also mentioned acquisitions and M&A strategically. Would there be a scenario where you guys would embark on an M&A transaction that didn't involve a real estate partner? Mark Frissora : I think that, in general, I'll let Eric answer, I guess. Why don't you go ahead? Eric Hession : Yes. I would say that it's very unlikely. I'd hate to say never. And it could be the size of the transaction might not be applicable to a real estate transaction. But if we're talking about a tuck-in acquisition of any size in the regional markets, it would certainly make sense given our other needs of capital, to use a real estate partner. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer. You may ask your question. Dan Politzer : So I want to hit on the change, the CEO change first. How are you guys going about the search for a potential candidate? And are you guys looking externally, internally? And do you guys have a time line of when you think that seat could be filled? Mark Frissora : I think that we have a committee on the Board, search committee, and they've engaged obviously an external consultant and the process can yield candidates right away or it could take 4 months, 5 months, I don't know. As you know, it is very variable. We're looking obviously internally, externally. And again, other than just stating what we're doing, that's about all I can speculate on. We don't know how that search will ensue and we obviously want to find someone that will allow us to move forward in a real seamless way and do that as quickly as we can. Dan Politzer : And just given the recent headlines on M&A regarding your company, I mean, does the vacancy change the time line or approach to M&A? Mark Frissora : No, I think, we've got a very active - we have different committees within the Board. We have an active committee that looks at all of our acquisitions and that process hasn't slowed down at all. And so I don't anticipate any delay. If there is something that we think creates value, shareholder value, we will move very quickly or it. Dan Politzer : And then, you guys talked about your strong October trends in Las Vegas. How should we think about going forward your performance in terms of lodging, relative to your peers on The Strip and the industry in general? Eric Hession : Yes, Dan, we've included in the earnings deck a slide that covers the RevPAR that we have generated in Las Vegas compared to that reported by the LVCVA and the change year-over-year. And we've outperformed The Strip by about a little over 300 basis points on average for 9 quarters. We believe that, that's largely due to our business model and also the room renovations that we have undertaken. We're about 70% of the way done with those by the end of the year. So I would anticipate some continued performance heading into next year that would outperform The Strip. At some point, you get diminishing returns after all of our rooms get back up to the level that they otherwise should be at, and so that will eventually diminish, but I would think heading into 2019, it's reasonable to expect continued outperformance. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Cameron McKnight of Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Cameron McKnight : So first of all, in terms of The Strip, Mark, I mean, we all know the third quarter was tough and a lot of words have been written and spoken about that. Looking forward, do you think anything has changed since the first quarter or the second quarter of this year? Or was the third quarter a genuine one-off or an outlier? Mark Frissora : I think that the only thing that for us that was a surprise was the precipitous drop that we saw in September, but everything that we've seen since then has been pretty much a return to normalcy. So in terms of looking at the Vegas business model going forward, we remain bullish. Cameron McKnight : And could you talk about expected city wide convention attendance for the fourth quarter and the first half of next year? And the magnitude to which you expect attendance might be up in those periods? Mark Frissora : I know we've previously reported the citywide attendance will be up in the fourth quarter of this year, and particularly in October. We did highlight for you that October was probably one of the best revenue months we've ever seen in hotel revenue for the month of October and that was, when you look at the citywides, I think, they went from last year in October, if I remember right, something like 250,000 to this year, 305,000. So we saw evidence of that and demand that we saw in October. And then in terms of other citywides, I think November is positive as well, roughly 20,000. I think December ends up being on citywides, at least as of a couple of weeks ago, still down because there weren't really any citywide events last year in December, but Eric, you can correct me if I'm wrong. Eric Hession : Yes, I think, that's right. Cameron McKnight : And then finally, in terms of room renovations and renovations you're making to the common areas at some of the properties on The Strip, do you think that you're taking share to some extent in Las Vegas? Mark Frissora : Every month, we have been fairly neutral to positive. I don't think - I don't know what the numbers on a month or day basis, but I know generally speaking, we were flat, at least flat to up on share in Vegas. And I know that at least through September. We were looking at it yesterday. So we're doing well. I think that what you see in market share here is, you've got to kind of look at the trend over time. One month, it will be blips based on, could be even baccarat play, it could be based on an event that's occurring at one of your facilities, but over time, I think, we have taken share, quite a bit of share, over the last three years. And we've seen kind of the similar kind of trends that we've had in the past, we're seeing it now. So we're hopeful that as we continue to reduce our reinvestment by targeting customers in a much more precision-oriented way that will be able to continue to either increase share or keep it flat with less reinvestment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. You may ask your question. Shaun Kelley : Just maybe one big picture one and then a more detailed one. So the big picture question would be, there's been a lot of press reports and media speculation about just sort of larger scale strategic options that the company could consider. I know these are really difficult to comment on in a public forum, but can you just give us a sense if there are any option that you guys can perceive of that is necessarily off the table as it would relate to kind of how the company looks at some of these things going forward and what structures it may or may not consider? Mark Frissora : Wow. It's a good question, Shaun. Unfortunately, we can't answer it. I just can't comment we've got a policy on anything with regards to M&A, so. I appreciate the question, though. Shaun Kelley : I had to ask. So let's move on. The other area would be on the gaming side. Eric, you talked a lot about Las Vegas on the hotel side and the environment, all the detail. By our calculation, I think, gaming revenues were down roughly 5% and maybe even if we adjust for hold, but can you just give us a sense of what you saw in the third quarter there? Because last quarter, I believe in the second quarter, you saw some real strength with some initiatives you're rolling out on the casino side. What's the status there? Is that a number that we should expect to see bounce back? And how do you see trends in the gaming customer? Eric Hession : Yes. It's a great question. We did see a lot of strength in the second quarter. We saw our gaming revenues, as you recall, on The Strip grow by about 7.5%, which is one of the better quarters that we've had. And then, of course, as you know in the third quarter, they fell off. We previewed it a little bit. Actually, at your conference, we had some slides that showed the VIP and VVIP segments down in the July and August periods. And unfortunately, that's the reality. Those two key segments' business were down. In the second quarter, they were up well. And as we head into the fourth quarter, we're seeing those two key components of our business up as well. So again, it is consistent with our belief that it was a 1-quarter dip in interest of coming to the city. There are a lot of variety of rationale for that, that we discussed over time from the activities that were going on. But the return of that piece of business as well as the demand in the hotel side gives us a lot of confidence as we look forward into 2019 and '20. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Thomas Allen : So thinking about the third quarter, you've talked a lot about how the event calendar just didn't really shape up and that's why revenues declined to the way they did for the market. Are you seeing the market fill 2019 in a more aggressive way now and do you have more confidence around, not kind of conventions or city-wise, but more your event calendar? Mark Frissora : I think that for the third quarter, I think, we may have said this before, but Celine Dion had canceled 20 performances in the third quarter, which was a big hit for us at Caesars Palace, which is, as you know, our number one gaming casino here. So I think that, that was definitely a factor. And we don't anticipate to see anything like that happen in the future, but you never know because we got a lot of theaters, a lot of performances that are good. And right now, we're making sure that we have a robust calendar for our own and we think what we see so far, the visibility we have into 2019, which is not that far, frankly, I mean, it is not totally - you wouldn't be able to say that '19 is, you see you have a lot of visibility, but what we see so far, we're bullish on. Eric, if anything you want to add to that, please do. Eric Hession : I'd just add, after the learnings in the third quarter, we're obviously actively tracking it with a whole lot more specificity and we're crying to come up with an option to slide in additional acts at short notice. Typically, acts that don't require a lot of staging like comedians or other shows like that, that we can bring in to backfill when one of the major acts has to cancel shows. So we're trying to derisk that type of environment. In the fourth quarter, the shows from the city look quite good. We've seen MGM added a couple of shows recently that should drive additional visitation to the city and then we have good bookings at ours as well. Thomas Allen : And then, I think, I missed some of your comments on Atlantic City in your prepared remarks. Can you just repeat, how did that perform versus your expectation in the third quarter? And how are you thinking about your previous guide of the $40 million impact in the second half of this year? Eric Hession : We haven't altered the $40 million impact. We believe we were negatively impacted by about $20 million in the third quarter and we continue to expect about $20 million in the fourth. We will try our best to offset a lot of the revenue declines that we're seeing and reduce expenses where we can, but the reality is that with two new operators entering the market in a period of low demand due to the time of year, it makes operating fixed cost businesses very challenging, and so, we're continuing with our guidance of the $40 million impact and that's reflected in our updated Q4 and full year projections. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon of Macquarie. You may ask your question. Chad Beynon : Mark, congrats on the last 4 years. I wanted to start with the guidance for the fourth quarter. You've still got $50 million EBITDA range out there. I think when you issued guidance back in July, it was a $50 million range. So given that here we are in November 1, in Vegas, you've mentioned that you've kind of filled your rooms with gaming customers, you weren't really taking much risk. Why still the $50 million range? And if you're able to provide any details on kind of what would put that closer to the top versus the bottom, that will be helpful. Eric Hession : It's a good question. And we did - we reduced the midpoint of the range by approximately $50 million to reflect the impact on the third quarter and we also kept the variance of the range at the same level. As you can see, we did come in lower than our expectations in the third quarter and we've also tried to provide what we think is a reasonable range for the fourth quarter to ensure that we're able to achieve the range even in the face of any unexpected headwinds that we might face. So given we are through 1 month from the revenue side, October looks quite strong, we haven't closed our books yet for the month and November and December look good here in Las Vegas as well. So we just wanted to make sure that we provided a range that was conservative enough for us to be able to ensure that we achieve. Chad Beynon : And then for the regionals, I guess, backing out Centaur and Atlantic City, pretty consistent EBITDA growth throughout the year, I believe, 8% to 10% or 11% per quarter and you've talked about the reduction of marketing cost and how that has gone towards the bottom line. How should we think about this in the fourth quarter and going forward? Are there still opportunities to reduce marketing further? Or do you think the comps are just so difficult that it might be hard to experience the same flow-through with revenue growth as you've seen in the first 3 quarters of the year? Eric Hession : We have had great success this year in terms of our marketing efficiency. The marketing department's been able to reduce marketing spend consistently across all 3 quarters. We would expect heading into the fourth quarter that we'd continue to be able to do that, particularly in the regional markets where it's less hotel-comp-centric. And next year, there is opportunity as well. We're currently putting together our plan and we're evaluating what we think we can do. We need to make sure that we don't lose profitable market share and that's an important distinction. There are certain segments of our customers that we are either marginally profitable or don't - could be unprofitable and those are the ones that we're trying to really pare back from a marketing perspective. We do have a number of technologies that we're going to introduce. The most important is our sales force initiative, which will come in, in the early part of next year and we think that, that's really going to enable us to continue this effort to push down our marketing expense and really allow us to target customers in a much more specific one-to-one dynamic. Mark Frissora : The only thing I'll add to that is the fourth quarter comparison year-over-year is a little rougher than, let's say, the first three quarters because we took a significant amount of cuts out that started actually in the fourth quarter of last year. Those kind of anniversary out here in November or December. But having said that, we - our whole marketing organizations continuously mine the data base, looking at our offers, determining whether or not which offers work, which don't. We're looking as many revenue initiatives as we are, efficiency initiatives. But the idea is to always look at them and always study and we keep studying and see what we can come up with. So I think, it's like one of those things where we're not prepared to give you numbers but the effort on continuous improvement is constant in the company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Nomura. You may ask your question. Harry Curtis : I just had 1 quick question. Most of my questions have been answered. Turning back to Total Rewards, when you think about the typical Total Rewards customer that comes in, what is the total revenue and profit per occupied room lift, say, compared to an OTA customer? And the reason I'm asking is, assuming that it's substantially higher, do you see yourself getting a lot more active, trying to increase the weeks of Total Rewards customers so you don't run into the same kind of booking gap that you had in September? Eric Hession : Yes, it really depends on, ultimately, which segment of customer that we're letting into the casino for that particular day. So we rank our customers' worth in terms of their daily expected spend. And depending on the rate of the room on that particular day, we'll either let certain segments of customers have free rooms or they'll pay a certain amount and that's effectively how we yield it. So there's a little bit of nuanced answer there. The goal, however, is to make sure that we're trading off a cash room for a casino customer room where the profits of both of those customers are about the same. Otherwise, we should raise the price of one or the other to drive the profit. What I will say is, in particular, in November and as we head into December, where occupancy levels are relatively low, those incremental gaming customers have great value because you're trading them off against an occupied room. And so, in that sense, all of that gaming value is incremental plus those customers at that level will typically pay the resort fee, which more than offsets the cost to clean the room. So we believe that trade-off is very profitable approach and that's why we're leaning heavily into it into the fourth quarter. Harry Curtis : So Eric, you did mention the resort fee and I guess, I would follow up with a question on that. Have you seen pushback from group meeting planners in particular with the resort fee and do you plan on taking that up again for 2019? Eric Hession : It's a good question, Harry. When meeting planners for large meetings, typically shop around to numerous cities like San Francisco, Boston, New York and other convention-centric locations. Las Vegas is still a great bargain, regardless of whether you account for all the fees or how they're added in. Typically, they'll negotiate a rate as well as a minimum banquet spend and then that will include a store fee and other fees like that. So we don't see a lot of pushback from the meeting planners because they're looking at it as a total value package for their meeting or their trade show. Harry Curtis : Have you given any thought to some of the softer drive-in business from California? I'm wondering to what degree the resort fees, parking and so forth have kept some of those marginal visitors away? Eric Hession : It's definitely something we're looking at. We have - we're well aware that from both the analysts' perspective, investors' perspective and customer perspective that we need to watch and make sure that we're not inhibiting the demand by the fees more so than we're losing in terms of the ability to drive the incremental profit. So we went out and we've conducted a very large survey of both our customers and customers that are just visitors who would come in not part of the database. That data is being analyzed right now and we will use that to inform us going forward. So far, we don't believe that, that's the case, but it's certainly something we watch and something we take very seriously. We don't want to end up in a situation where we're depressing demand and impacting our profitability more so than we'd intended. Harry Curtis : Very good. And Mark, best of luck on your next adventure. Mark Frissora : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. You may ask your question. Robin Farley : Two things I wanted to ask. One of them Mark may have addressed a little bit already. But just looking at your EBITDA growth guidance for the full year and your reduced marketing expense accounts for kind of more than the entire amount of that EBITDA growth guidance. And so my question was, in Q4, that anniversaries and may be tougher to get that level and so I was sort of looking for what might drive your same-store EBITDA growth there? I don't know, it sounded like you didn't maybe want to put numbers on that, but I don't know if you had anything else, any other thoughts on that. And then I did have a question about Q3 as well. Eric Hession : I think you're talking about next year, Robin? Robin Farley : No, in other words, looking at your EBITDA growth guidance for 2018, the entire amount of the marketing reduction accounts for more than the entire EBITDA growth. In other words, the same-store EBITDA growth would have been down without the reduction in marketing cost. But what happens after Q4 or in Q4, when you anniversary that significant reduction in marketing expense? Kind of what becomes the driver for same-store EBITDA growth? Mark Frissora : So, obviously, our organic growth rate helps drive incremental same-store growth, so we do expect some - a lot of our gaming strategies to actually take an impact. We're improving our hold, for example, this year. We don't give specific numbers, but we have a very focused initiative around control of the hold and we try to take anything that we can and, whether it's improving the game mix equipment that we have on the floor, whether it is putting in a more impulse-oriented area of the floor. There's a number of initiatives we have that have been improving actually our overall gaming profitability. So that will be one of the drivers that we'll use in the fourth quarter that will help. And then in terms of just the general strategies around Centaur and looking at how we're going to drive incremental growth synergies there, I think, that will help - that will play itself out also in the fourth quarter. Eric, you want to add to that? Eric Hession : The only other thing I'd add, Robin, is that the marketing expenses that we reflect as a percentage of our gaming spend, that doesn't flow 100% to the bottom line. So a lot of that is in kind. It's beverage rounds, it's other types of complementaries. So the notion that it's 100% accretive to EBITDA, you need to profit adjust that figure. Robin Farley : And then, my question on Q3, you mentioned there were some decline in VIP and VVIP gaming segments in Q3. And I'm just wondering, is that tied to the group calendar issue that you mentioned? In other words, what would be kind of nonrecurring or behind - is that what you put in the bucket of nonrecurring or just one-time? And just thinking about your - I understand not wanting to give the RevPAR guidance because of the factors that can change your comps and things, but would you guide to kind of a cash rate for Q4 just to give a sense of where kind of cash demand is for the rooms aside from your changes in marketing? Eric Hession : Sure. To answer your first question, the customer mix that we receive into our casinos for a given month or even a quarter can be very volatile. So I wouldn't want to call it 1 time because it can certainly recur, but when you take in the portfolio of the business over the entire year period, it's certainly something that's an anomaly and something that we don't think is representative of the true business. In fact, when you look at the second quarter, we saw the exact opposite happening. And then when we look into the fourth quarter, we believe that the strength is coming back as well. So in that sense, it's second quarter up strong, third quarter down fairly significantly and in the fourth quarter, back. All averaged out to having reasonable growth here in Las Vegas from those casino segments. So overall, there are a lot of factors that drive those decisions by customers, but that's not a permanent decline that we're going to see and we wouldn't expected to happen every single year going forward. Robin Farley : And then I didn't know if you had any thoughts on the cash rate part of the question? Eric Hession : I'm sorry. Yes, regarding the guidance, we're evaluating what guidance we're going to provide for next year. We're not providing any hotel-related guidance for the fourth quarter, but as part of our efforts to try to make sure that we have the best indicators out for the analyst and investing community, we're evaluating whether we should provide an alternative metric like you suggested or something similar that we could help guide for 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Jared Shojaian : First, just a quick clarification, in case I may be missing something. You gave fourth quarter hold-adjusted EBITDAR guidance. Was there any unusual hold activity in October that we need to be aware of in terms of the actual fourth quarter? Eric Hession : We haven't said anything about the current year hold. What we said was relative to the prior year. So we're assuming normal hold for the fourth quarter when we provided the guidance, Jared. Jared Shojaian : You said you're 90% booked in terms of your target group room nights for 2019. Can you just tell us how that compares to this time last year? And at what price point are those booked at? Eric, I think you had said solid increase, is that correct? Eric Hession : Yes. So the way that the group segment works is that we do book, say, an extra 20 to 30% room nights during the year, but we also have wash, meaning that somebody commits to a group of 1,000 room nights, they always - or not always but they typically come in a little bit lower. So to the extent that our room nights that we're booking in the year offset that wash, that's how you get to these really high numbers when you're entering the year. So the 90% is better than we typically run. It gives us confidence into next year and it lets us know that we can start really yielding that segment of business up. In terms of the rates, the rates are up heading into next year. And when we talk about that segment of business, we look at it as a combination of the rate that's charged as well as the banquets business because the banquet business is a very profitable component and we want the meeting planners to think of them in combination when they're booking the piece of business. You might book a lower-rated piece of business on a RevPAR basis, but take a much higher banquet component, and ultimately, the profitability could be better in that segment or vice versa. Jared Shojaian : And then just one last one for me, more higher-level. Given a lot of volatility in your store, I just want to ask about the potential opportunity to be added to the S&P 500. Have you had any conversations with them? I think in the past, they've had stipulations on GAAP profitability, which may be challenging for you to overcome just given the failed sale coming out of bankruptcy? So can you speak to that a little bit? Eric Hession : Yes, you are right. There are profitability requirements. We do have a headwind. We break it out in the materials from the failed sale and accounting treatment that we have and that does affect our GAAP EPS and does have a headwind in terms of our retaining profitability for the required number of quarters. That said, we think we posted positive GAAP earnings per share in this quarter. We do have a lot of charges, including the convert, which is a derivative of the share price, and so it makes it very difficult to predict earnings per share with respect to having this component that's a derivative of the actual trading value of our stock. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ms. Joyce Arpin for closing remarks. Joyce Arpin : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining. We'll talk to you after we report our fourth quarter results next year.",

Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Steven Rubis, Vice President of Investor Relations for Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Mr. Rubis, the floor is yours. Steven Rubis : Thank you Sarah. Good afternoon and welcome to the Caesars Entertainment fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Mark Frissora, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the press release, earnings presentation slides, and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at caesars.com. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of the earnings release to the SEC in a form 8-K and we'll also file our Form 10-K. Before we get underway, I would like to remind you to reference slides 2 through 4, which include forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers, and definitions of certain non-GAAP measures. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today's date and we have no obligation to update or revise them. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to unanticipated hold fluctuations, weather or other unforeseen circumstances that we do not control. There are certain risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our filings with the SEC that may impact our results. In addition, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, or CEOC, emerged from bankruptcy on October 6, 2017, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation completed its merger with Caesars Acquisition Company, or CAC, on that date. We also deconsolidated the results of the Horseshoe Baltimore in the third quarter of 2017 and closed on the acquisition of Centaur Holdings in the third quarter of 2018. Therefore, U.S. GAAP results do not include CEOC for the first six days of Q4 2017, do not include Horseshoe Baltimore in Q4 2017, and do not include Centaur Holdings prior to the acquisition in Q3 2018 unless otherwise stated. Enterprise-wide results include CEOC in the prior year and include Centaur Holdings in the current year post acquisition and exclude the Horseshoe Baltimore in both years unless otherwise stated. And enterprise-wide hold-adjusted results reflect hold versus our expectation. You can find reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP figures starting on slide 26. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Please turn to Slide 6. Mark Frissora : Thank you, Steve. And I'll provide a high level overview of our performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and then give a few updates on our business before turning the call over to Eric to discuss our results in greater detail. First, I'd like to address the recent 13D filing from entities affiliated with Carl Icahn disclosing ownership of 9.78% of Caesars outstanding shares. We regularly engage with our shareholders and consider their ideas and input regarding shareholder value. The board and management have engaged in discussions with Mr. Icahn and his representatives, and we expect to continue a constructive dialogue. We intend to carefully evaluate Mr. Icahn\u2019s suggestions, including his request for board representation and will provide updates in due course. Now turning to the results. Caesars Entertainment delivered another year of solid operating performance driven by our ongoing focus on continuous improvement programs and the realization of benefits from our growth initiatives. This resulted in full-year adjusted EBITDAR growth of 4.6% and the highest quarterly enterprise adjusted EBITDAR margin in over a decade at 27.5%. Key highlights in 2018 include closing the acquisition of Centaur Holdings, announcing high profile sports entertainment partnerships, and expanding our sports betting business to new jurisdictions. We also began construction of the new Caesars Forum Convention Center on the Las Vegas Strip and introduced several new Caesars branded resorts as part of our asset light strategy.  For the full year, enterprise-wide net revenues were 8.4 billion, up 2.7% year over year driven by the acquisition of Centaur. Excluding Centaur, net revenues were flat as growth in Las Vegas was offset by declines in Atlantic City due to competitive pressures and unfavorable year-over-year hold at our international properties. The competitive environment in Atlantic City remains challenging due to increased promotional activity from new entrants. Full-year adjusted EBITDAR totaled $2.3 billion and was up 4.6% year-over-year or 1.4% excluding Centaur. Hold-adjusted EBITDAR was $2.3 billion, up 4.1% year over year. Marketing and operational efficiency efforts remained a key driver of performance throughout the year. But domestic marketing costs and labor costs improved in 2018. Domestic marketing costs represented 20.1% of our gross revenue, down 160 basis points year over year, while labor costs represented 23.6% of our gross revenue, down 30 basis points year over year. Domestic marketing performance represented a full year record. Fourth quarter enterprise wide net revenues were 2.1 billion, up 7.4% year over year or 1.2% excluding Centaur as we benefit from an improved demand environment as well as our ability to leverage our casino database in Las Vegas following third quarter softness. Las Vegas RevPAR grew 10.9% year-over-year in the quarter. Strengthen in Las Vegas was partially offset by ongoing competitive pressures in Atlantic City due to the new entrants. Enterprise wide adjusted EBITDAR of 567 million was up 12.1% year over year or 4.3% excluding Centaur. Gains from ongoing efficiency efforts drove performance while we maintained rational and disciplined marketing reinvestment in Atlantic City. Before I turn the call over to Eric, let me provide some key business updates since our last earnings call. Slide 7, the Centaur Holdings acquisition closed in July and performance has been strong post-acquisition as we've realized operational and expense synergies from the integration. Post-acquisition, Centaur\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 EBITDAR grew 21% year-over-year compared to 5% year over year in the second quarter of \u201818 prior to the transaction.  Strong EBITDAR growth in the fourth quarter illustrates our effective cost management and ability to drive operating efficiencies in a short amount of time. We remain confident delivering continued synergies and achieving our goal of $200 million of EBITDAR contribution in two full years, which represents an accretive implied multiple of less than six times. This reflects financing the acquisition with the sale leaseback of Harrah's Las Vegas and is inclusive of synergies. Slide 8, recently we announced several partnerships that continue to raise Caesars profile among professional sports fan with both the NFL, Turner Broadcasting, and the Bleacher Report. Building on several successful relationships with NFL teams, last month, we announced an exclusive sponsorship with the NFL, making Caesars Entertainment the first ever official casino sponsor in the history of the league. Caesars holds exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks in the US and UK to promote our casino properties.  Furthermore Caesars will be hosting existing customers and attract new customers at prominent high profile NFL events, including the Superbowl, combine, and draft. Following our partnership with the NFL, two weeks ago, we announced a groundbreaking agreement with Turner Broadcasting and sports media hub Bleacher Report to develop gaming theme content for sports fans around the globe. The partnership includes a new Bleacher Report production studio to be built at Caesar's Palace, which will function as Bleacher Report's third national studio. Bleacher Report will produce daily video and social content from Caesars Palace as well as satellite locations at our other Las Vegas properties. Caesars will be able to leverage the strengths and establish media company and access Bleacher Report's over 22 million followers to expand the Caesars rewards database. Caesars, in turn, has also partnered to create four televised specials annually which will highlight Caesars assets and can be used to provide a unique experience for Caesars guest. The deal also includes sponsorship and media opportunities across the Bleacher\u2019s and Turner's content. We are excited to partner with a leading digital destination for millennial and Gen Z sports fans to amplify our sports gaming experience for guests, [indiscernible] professional sports and reach a new generation of gaming customers. We also made further progress developing our sports betting business, our sports book in New Jersey and Mississippi saw solid sequence increases in violence during the fourth quarter. We are creating three sports book locations in Atlantic City with several more in the pipeline pending legislation. In late January, we expanded our sports betting offering to Pennsylvania including a sports book at Caesars Harris, Philadelphia casino and racetrack. In Las Vegas, we continue to test new and innovative sports entertainment experience as part of our broader casino innovation strategy. At the recently renovated The Book at the LINQ Hotel and Casino, fans can find a wide range of experiences including rentable fanbase for sports viewing, eSports, virtual reality games, skill based slot games, LED screens, and soon to become digital table games and an innovative bar experience. Slide nine, our customer database represents an important performance driver for Caesars. Recently, we announced the rebranding of total rewards, our industry leading 55 million member loyalty program to Caesars rewards. The rebranding follows research that demonstrates several important benefits of extending our flagship Caesars brand to our loyalty program. It unifies all properties under the luxury Caesars brand, increasing guest awareness and association of our properties with the brand. The change enables premium pricing through better brand positioning, maximizing the fair share premium earned by our Caesars reward network properties and creates additional value over time by extending our iconic brands to new cities around the world. Caesars rewards allows us to better unify our loyalty members across our properties and regions under our most recognizable brands, Caesars, by leveraging the premium Caesars brand we'll be able to better connect Caesars\u2019 brand standard and brand prestige across our portfolio both domestically and internationally. The new program will offer new ways to earn hotel stays, as well as access to unique special events, including New Year's Eve parties, celebrity golf outings, and fame sporting events. Caesars rewards offer our most loyal customers and opportunity to not only earn points across our global portfolio but also be rewarded with unique experiences. We're excited about this opportunity to strengthen our unrivaled customer rewards program. Slide 10, Caesars continues to make progress on our asset light and non-gaming initiatives. The newest branded property in our Caesars portfolio Caesars Public in Scottsdale, Arizona, which will break ground in the second half of \u201819. The property marks our first non-gaming Hotel in the US as part of our plans to expand our brands and loyalty network into premier destinations through our licensing strategy. Caesars Republic Scottsdale will be located adjacent to the region's premier luxury retail destination, Scottsdale Fashion Square and will be a four-star hotel developed by HCW development and operated by Ambridge Hospitality. This development follows the opening of Caesars Bluewaters Dubai resort in the fourth quarter. I would also like to highlight a recent achievement involving our sustainability efforts CDP, formally, the Carbon Disclosure Project, has recognized Caesars as a leader in our efforts and actions to manage carbon emissions and address climate related issues across our supply chain within the supplier engagement category. Out of the 5,000 companies that participated, Caesars was the only company that was recognized from the gaming sector. I am pleased with our accomplishment in 2018. We achieved a record full year adjusted EBITDAR margin marking four years of margin expansion while achieving record customer service scores and making investments in the company's long-term growth. We once again outperformed our peers in Las Vegas across key performance indicators for the fourth consecutive year which Eric will discuss in more detail. We successfully expanded the Caesars Entertainment Network through the accretive acquisition of Centaur and execution on our asset light strategy, beginning with the opening of Caesars Bluewater Dubai and with more to come in 2019. Also, we made important investments in innovation in our core gaming business and emerging areas like sports betting. In summary, we are successfully executing on the plan that we set out at Emergence and we have a clear path forward to creating significant shareholder value.  Eric will review this and our financial results in more detail now. Eric Hession : Thank you, Mark. I'll discuss our enterprise wide fourth quarter 2018 results in more detail. As a reminder, our commentary include CEOC results and Centaur, but excludes Horseshoe Baltimore from the prior year period unless otherwise stated. For the fourth quarter, our Las Vegas net revenue totaled 949 million, up 7.8% year over year due to strong results in our hotel, favorable year over year hold, and lower prior year performance due to the tragedy. Las Vegas\u2019 fourth quarter performance benefited from strength in nearly every vertical including higher gaming volumes, growth in food and beverage, and growth in the hotel segment. Gaming volumes were driven by 3% increase in Baccarat slots and table games. Hotel cash revenue was up 8% year over year. Our RevPAR was $139, up 11% year over year. Cash ADR was $164, up 6% year over year and hotel occupancy was 93.8%, a 4-point improvement year over year. Food and beverage revenue also grew in the fourth quarter driven by the opening of several new outlets including Hell's Kitchen and Pronto by Giada. Our Las Vegas adjusted EBITDAR was 351 million, up 18.2% year over year or up 8.9% when adjusting for hold. Our Las Vegas properties overall performance in the fourth quarter reinforces a story of stability, despite the temporary third quarter results. In 2019, we continue to expect modest growth in Las Vegas, which I'll discuss in greater detail later on the call. We were quite pleased with our Las Vegas performance in both the fourth quarter and the full year 2018. Our Las Vegas results outperformed our peers in net revenue growth, adjusted EBITDAR growth and adjusted EBITDAR margins for both the fourth quarter and in the full year. Other US net revenues totaled $1.0 billion, up 9.3%, including Centaur or down 3.8% on a same store basis. Atlantic City was the primary driver of the same-store decline due to ongoing competitor pressures from new entrants who have significantly increased levels of promotional activity. We estimate these factors had a $20 million impact on EBITDAR in the quarter. Other US adjusted EBITDAR was 320 million, up 10.6% and we estimate it would have been up 1.9%, excluding both Centaur and Atlantic City. In the all other segment, revenues and adjusted EBITDAR were down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The declines were primarily attributable to unfavorable hold at our international properties and increased costs year-over-year due to our continued IT cloud based transformation and growth initiatives, which are critical to enhancing the future performance of the company. From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in enterprise wide cash. We also currently have $100 million drawn on our CRC revolver, resulting in approximately $1.1 billion of total revolver availability. Cash capital expenditures for the year totaled 419 million for same store CapEx, which included significant room renovations at [indiscernible] and 146 million for development CapEx, which included initial spend on the Caesars forum and some South Korea spend as well. Due to our effective working capital management, around $65 million worth of same store CapEx and around $35 million worth of development CapEx incurred in 2018 was paid in Q1 of 2019. Excluding the convertible notes and capitalizing on our cash lease payments at 8 times, our net leverage stands at approximately 5.5 times adjusted EBITDAR and our traditional debt -- net leverage is at around 4.3 times. We completed no further share repurchases and did not pay down any debt in the fourth quarter. While we remain committed to de-leveraging the balance sheet, we felt it was prudent to preserve flexibility, as we evaluate the highest return uses for our cash in 2019. Our focus remains on a balanced capital allocation strategy and we reiterate our gross lease adjusted target of 4.5 times by the end of 2021. Regarding our 2019 outlook, we will provide some quantitative and qualitative information to aid in the understanding of the drivers of the business. We're foregoing providing traditional adjusted EBITDAR guidance range, as we're focused on building and growing the business over the long term. Our operations may face volatility from quarter to quarter, especially in Las Vegas due to several factors, including conference schedules, holidays, entertainment, and sporting events. However, for the full year, Las Vegas and the company in general displayed stable results. For the full year, we expect top line growth in Las Vegas to be in line with what we delivered in 2018. This is reinforced by our group business, which is projected to be up mid-single digits in revenues year-over-year and our rooms on the books currently up 4% year-over-year in Q1. However, we expect EBITDAR flow through in Las Vegas to be impacted throughout the year by a combination of labor headwinds as we contend with the tight labor market and wage inflation, as well as incremental investments in security across our properties. We expect to be able to partially offset these expense increases through ongoing operational initiatives. In the other US segment, we expect growth in 2019 to largely be driven by an incremental $80 million to $85 million of adjusted EBITDAR contribution from Centaur. Recall, we closed on the Centaur acquisition in July of 2018. We expect the ongoing competitive promotional environment in Atlantic City to offset this performance by approximately $40 million of adjusted EBITDAR, half of which is expected to occur in the first quarter. We anticipate the competitive pressure in Atlantic City to moderate beginning in the third quarter once we annualize the effects of the new entrants in that region. We also expect some competitive headwinds at certain of our properties in Midwest as supply continues to grow. Lastly, we continue making important investments in our business to drive future growth, including incremental operating expenses to further expand our sports business and the continuation of our enterprise wide IT transformation. At the same time, we will continue to pursue revenue and cost efficiencies led by our office of continuous improvement, which will seek to optimize cash flow. We expect to continue to utilize our casino database for Las Vegas rooms when additional demand is needed, which is expected to offset certain marketing savings in the other US regions. While we continue to identify and pursue additional marketing efficiency programs, we do not expect to generate the same level of marketing cost savings in 2019 as we did in 2018 company wide. For the first quarter specifically, we expect modest revenue growth in Las Vegas. In addition, similar to our competitors, we experienced the lighter Chinese New Year this year versus last year.  We also have experienced some weather related property closures this year in the other US segments due to severe cold weather and snow as well as flooding of certain properties, which is expected to continue in the coming weeks. In the all other region, we expect performance remain in line with the prior year. However, we're focused on reducing corporate costs. They are currently elevated due to our IT transformation and sports betting businesses, and we expect to show improvement later in the year from the current run rate. For CapEx, we expect a range of 375 million to 450 million for same store, which includes room renovations at Harrah's Las Vegas and Paris. This range is down year-over-year as we wind down our accelerated room renovation project. We also expect to spend approximately 475 million to 550 million in development CapEx, which includes the Caesars Forum project and the Korea project and our investments in sports books across the US. We generated solid operating cash flow in 2018 which we have reinvested in improving certain assets as well as pursuing certain growth initiatives. As these investment activities come to completion in 2019, we anticipate generating strong free cash flow of more than $500 million and in 2020, nearly -- sorry in 2020 and nearly double that amount in 2021. We anticipate using our free cash flow for de-leveraging, returning capital to shareholders and pursuing strategic M&A and development opportunities when available. We're now ready to open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Mark, just wanted to start with your agreement to remain in your role through the end of April. In the press release, you announced that the process of replacement is still ongoing. Wondering if you or Eric could provide a little bit more commentary in terms of kind of where we are in the process, if there's anything else that you can provide outside of what was in the release? Thank you. Mark Frissora : Yeah, I think the best way to characterize it was we\u2019re far along in the process, I mean we've gotten through obviously interviewing candidates and have a very good list of potential candidates for this position. So I think committee would say that feel comfortable with -- that we're far enough along the process that we will be in good shape for the transition to ensure a seamless transition here with me. Chad Beynon : Okay, great. And then on the Centaur acquisition, it looks like that was a bright spot here. The EBITDAR that you generated in the fourth quarter was better than I think most were expecting. Eric, you gave some commentary in terms of what you're expecting for 2019. But given that, this multiple appears to be lower than maybe even what you thought at the beginning, does this improve, I guess, your chances on doing more M&A or how should we think about the balance of share repurchase that pay down and M&A going forward. Thank you. Eric Hession : Yeah. We are pleased with how Centaur is performing. As you can see, the EBITDAR was up significantly and a little bit faster in terms of realizing those synergies than we had anticipated. The revenues were generally flat because the marketing programs hadn't yet kicked in and so that should happen in 2019 as we move forward. So we're pleased with how it's worked out. It's very consistent with the model, consistent with what we've said before. We're leaning towards prioritizing debt reduction at this point. However, we are always open for accretive transactions and should those be available and should they make sense from a domestic bolt-on acquisition perspective, we'd certainly look at them and pursue them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Dan Politzer from JPMorgan. Dan Politzer : So the first one on Las Vegas, can you give an update on what you're seeing as it relates to leisure and transient demand and I guess have you seen much stabilization over the past six or eight months or has it still been kind of ebbing and flowing with the calendar, the citywide calendar? Mark Frissora : I think I mean, Eric and I can both maybe answer this. It's certainly stabilized since the third quarter. So I think it's clear in our demand that we're getting for the business has stabilized and declined and even the rate decline is completely dissipated. But, I wouldn't characterize it as a strong demand pattern, but I would say that it's stable. Eric? Eric Hession : Yeah, I agree. We continue to be able to, as we demonstrated, backfill with casino hotel rooms in periods of weak demand from an occupancy perspective. But I would say echoing Marks commentary that the ability to really drive price is somewhat limited, at least in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. Dan Politzer : And then -- and a question on your rooms in Las Vegas. I guess before you activated the database, your casino block was roughly I think, 40% or so. So, I guess, how did 4Q makes compare with that historic level? And going forward, how should we think about the mix? And is there any expected seasonality with how you activate the database running in certain quarters? Eric Hession : Yeah. There is seasonality and fourth quarter is on the higher end of the normal edge of the casino mix. We ran about 52.5% casino mix in the fourth quarter, which was up from the prior year. To put that in perspective, we had about 62,000 more casino rooms in the fourth quarter than in the prior year period, and that certainly contributed to the 4 points of incremental occupancy that we are able to achieve. Ultimately, we think it was a good strategy as it drove X incremental EBITDAR. And so, as I mentioned, as we head into this year, we'll still be able to use that to backfill on periods of weak demand where we don't think we'll fill the hotel. During the first quarter, however, the group demand across the city and in-house is stronger than it was in the fourth quarter. So, we don't necessarily believe we'll have to comp as many incremental rooms to still achieve occupancy growth. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then I guess, one last quick one. Centaur has been obviously tracking better than expected. How should we think about the timing or, I guess, your appetite for still monetizing the real estate there and how should we think about tables playing into that decision? Eric Hession : Yeah. I think it's still probably too early, as we talked about before in an environment where we have some -- the table games potentially coming online and an acceleration of our performance, we would either be selling the property at a very low coverage ratio and growing into it or selling at a price that's not necessarily optimal. So, I think at this point, we are still waiting until we see some more stability in the property because we don't want to sell it at a point where it's growing so quickly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Cameron McKnight from Credit Suisse. Cameron McKnight : Eric, would you mind giving some more detail on what you're seeing on the cost side and how does that differ between Las Vegas and the regional markets? Eric Hession : Sure. I guess, I'll look at it on our two primary categories of expense, which is labor and marketing. On the labor side, we're definitely seeing incremental labor cost pressures at a higher level than we have in the past years. Company-wide, we're estimating about an $80 million increase and that's associated with simply union wage increases, merit wage increases for non-union employees, 401(k) returning to a normalized match and then health benefits. And in aggregate, it's about 80 million, which as I mentioned is higher than in prior years. So, we have efforts to try to offset that through productivity, but that's definitely a headwind that we'll have to work through this year. From a marketing standpoint, as I mentioned, we do anticipate to have additional comped hotel rooms in the Las Vegas area over the course of the full year. And so we don't anticipate as much of a marketing reduction there. In the regional markets, we continue to believe that there's opportunity to reduce marketing spend. We have a number of programs that we will be launching and affecting second and third quarter and onward. In particular, our sales force application became live earlier in the year. And so those marketing efforts will start to hit the customers in the April and May timeframe, which will help drive down the ultimate marketing costs in the second and into the third quarter. Cameron McKnight : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then on the room side in Las Vegas, there were lot of rooms that were off the market in the fourth quarter. How should we think about those rooms coming back on through the course of 2019 and how should we think about available room nights, just generally speaking in '19 versus '18? Eric Hession : So yeah, for the first quarter, we're going to expect to have about 25,000 incremental room nights available companywide. We'll have fewer available on Atlantic City because we're renovating our hotel tower there, and we'll have about 35,000 more available in Las Vegas in the first quarter. The impact of that is about $4 million to $5 million benefit here in Las Vegas from the incremental room nights available. And then as we go through the years, a year, we will also have fewer -- or sorry, we'll have more room nights available because we're only planning to do two hotel towers this year, hotel tower Paris and hotel tower Harrah's, now that we have caught up on our accelerated room renovation program. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey. Thank you. So, just going back to the 2019 guidance you discussed, I think, I checked the transcript and you said that you expect fiscal year results to be relatively stable. Can you elaborate on that? So, you just did $2.3 billion of EBITDA. Should we imply you telling us, you're basically going to do similar in 2019? Eric Hession : I think -- I apologize if the script wasn't clear. We were talking more about the volatility between quarters that if you look at it on a full year basis, it's generally stable. And a great example of that is, if you do a two-year stack of our Las Vegas EBITDAR, it's very consistent within 1% or 2% change every single quarter. So, you can see that a lot of it's affected by holidays and different events like that. What we meant was that our -- we anticipate in Las Vegas that our revenues are going to be roughly consistent with the same growth rates that we saw from this year. Thomas Allen : Okay. Helpful. And then for regionals, I mean, you talked about the promotional side of things, can you just talk about how you think about the health of the regional consumer? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yeah. I think the regional consumer from our perspective seems fine right now. In the fourth quarter, we didn't pursue any activities with respect to buybacks or deleveraging because we wanted to be cautious, so that we headed into the New Year with all the signals that you can get from the macroeconomic perspective, but our customers seem generally healthy across the board. We do have the incremental competition that we talked about, which I think is probably the most important factor weighing on our business next year. But otherwise, we would expect these regional markets to be performing at about the same levels in terms of year-over-year improvement as we did this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Harry Curtis : Hi. Just a couple of quick ones. So, following up on again, the guidance in Vegas. If you have an $80 million labor pressure headwind, I mean, as a practical matter, doesn't that suggest that your EBITDAR in Vegas to -- I mean you're going to need, what, 3% RevPAR growth just to stay flat in Vegas? Mark Frissora : The headwind is definitely more significant than we've seen in the past, let's say, four years and it's really a result of, you\u2019re right, Vegas, Harry, that's a big driver. But we had two other markets too that we had to renegotiate labor contracts, so a total of three markets for us, regional markets. And for us, anyways, we think that the first half of the year, because of that headwind, it will be more difficult to get the kind of flow through we normally get out of our business model. But in the second half of the year, we have initiatives in place on labor and in marketing that will help us get better productivity numbers out in the second half of 2019 and be helpful at offsetting that. Eric Hession : And just to clarify, Harry, the 80 million we mentioned was companywide, not just Las Vegas. Harry Curtis : All right. And my second question. Going back to the CEO search, can you just talk about some of the attributes that the Board is looking for that are desirable in 2019 and as we look ahead for the next five years, maybe what are the characteristics that are important do you think? Mark Frissora : I think the Board has stated that they would like to see someone who's a seasoned executive, someone who has certainly managed through turbulent times, adversity and been able to be tested, if you will, that's an important trait, someone that has experience in hospitality/gaming and related verticals that we participate in, someone that would have a great reputation with investors, someone who would have staying power and be here for the long haul. So, I think those are all traits that we're looking for. And again, feel like the Caesars brand and the opportunity here is big enough, it's attracting a good talent pool for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : I just want to clarify something. One of the comments you made was that Las Vegas for the year, you expected to deliver top line growth that was similar to your 2018 result. I think it was kind of what -- how you phrased it. So are you -- you're effectively saying, you think 2019, you can grow revenue in and around the neighborhood of 2.5%, which was the revenue growth rate in 2018. Is that correct? Eric Hession : Yeah, I would just say that we should be able to do that or hopefully, we can do a little better. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. So, my question is how much of that do you believe is just overall kind of strip growth and how much of that do you believe relates to your own initiatives and maybe some of the segments of the business that you're levered to? And maybe more specifically, how much of that is based on kind of what you mentioned with respect to your group business, which I think you said was up mid-single digits for the year and obviously, the first quarter being up a little bit? Eric Hession : Yeah, I think certainly having the group base up for both our in-house business as well as the city-wide business on a year-over-year basis helps. As we saw, having the city-wide business certainly helps the environment for all the casinos and allows you to price a little bit better. We also feel that our initiatives that we did in the fourth quarter with respect to the casino database will be effective throughout the year in terms of driving additional improvements. And then, as you know, we always have incremental initiatives both on the cost and revenue side.  A lot of them now focused on gaming. We think, again, that there are some innovative products that's coming out, that we're trying on the floor. The sports book that we have at the LINQ is doing quite well. The food and beverage we mentioned before is doing quite well, particularly when the occupancy in the hotel goes up in correlation to the cash spending in the hotels -- sorry, in the food and beverage. And so all of that taken together, gives us the confidence that we should be able to have a top line performance in that range that we talked about. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Great. And then if I -- so, I guess, if I just ask it a little bit differently. Last year, as you kind of entered 2018, I think you guys talked about, hey, tell me what the rate of growth in the market is going to be and we are going to do X basis points better. You still believe in 2019, there's going to be an outpacing of whatever the market growth looks like based on some of the internal initiatives, is that correct? Mark Frissora : I think it's difficult to predict that. I don't -- I'm not saying it won't happen. But as we continue to test and learn with our marketing initiatives and look at making sure that every dollar revenue we get is a profitable dollar revenue, a lot of that comes into play in the mix and in our growth rate. So kind of a, I don't mean to be a long-winded question, but it's a complicated equation for us to predict outperformance without more visibility into the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : I wanted to go back to the capital allocation discussion and just make sure that I'm taking the information clearly because, Eric, in your commentary, you talked about leaning toward deleveraging but leaving the door open for other options as well. And in the past, you've talked about a longer-term leverage target. What would you have us think about for '19 and '20 in terms of a leverage range, either lease adjusted or non-lease adjusted? Eric Hession : We haven't provided the specific year-end targets, it\u2019s just the end of the 2021 at 4.5 times. We do plan to put that together and discuss it with the new CEO and the Board, and we'll make a decision at that point, probably in Investor Day or some other forum to provide more detail on that throughout the years. David Katz : Got it. And in terms of just the appetite for acquisitions in the near term or any pipeline of things that you're looking at? Is it a more or less active pipeline than it was, say, 9 months ago or 12 months ago? Eric Hession : I would say, of the properties that we're specifically interested in, I would say it's a little less active than it was before. A lot of properties have traded hands and then some people have elected not to sell that might have been interested before. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Barry Jonas : Just starting with Vegas. I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts around resort, parking or other fees and an impact on visitation. Maybe what direction do you think those fees will move going forward? Thanks. Mark Frissora : I think that at this point, we don't have any current plans on changing the structure that we have in place. And we certainly are sensitive to the fact that we could hurt our own profitability and revenue growth if we get exuberant or if we do things that have no value to them. We tried to -- probably resort fees are actually tied to a lot of services we provide guests at no charge. So the idea is anything that would be incremental, it would be some kind of value that we created as a result of it for the customer. But I think, Eric, your feelings on it, I think were similar. But any comments from you? Eric Hession : Nothing else. Mark Frissora : Okay. Barry Jonas : Great. And then just touching base on New Jersey and I know it's early days, but maybe can you comment on your sports betting market share in Jersey? Maybe how do you see that ramping going forward? Thanks. Mark Frissora : Our sports betting market share, I want to make sure I heard that right. You asked if our share would go up. Eric Hession : Yeah, I think he was talking about market share currently. Yeah. Right now, we don't have any of our books completed. They are under construction. We're optimistic that these are going to be great experiences and we'll take a lot of what we have at the LINQ property here and port those over to Atlantic City. The one thing I would say is that market share right now for us is not necessarily the way that we're going. It could cause significant reinvestment levels to take significant market share. We are profitable with our operations, and we think that we can increase and decrease marketing to try to optimize that. But we're pleased with how we are leading off, being profitable and making money throughout our sports betting intervals. Mark Frissora : And I would add that -- in addition to Eric's comments that our plan long-term is to have our fair share of the market through partnerships in some cases. So, at this point in time, we have not completed all of our partnerships. People that, let's say, would have more aggressive marketing directly tied to us, say sports betting that we may or -- and then they may not have access to markets like we have. So, we're looking for partnerships, and we'll continue to do that in order for us to gain our fair share of the market with these partnerships and alliances that were formed. Operator : Thank you. And presenters, you have the floor. Mark Frissora : Thank you. With that, we'll wrap up the call. Thank you and we look forward to giving you an update at the first quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you to all participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes our webcast. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a good day.",

Please note that all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise, and that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. Steven Rubis, Vice President of Investor Relations for Caesars Entertainment. The floor is yours. Steven Rubis : Thank you, Leeway. Good afternoon. And welcome to the Caesars Entertainment First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today from Caesars Entertainment Corporation are Tony Rodio, Chief Executive Officer; Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer; and Joyce Arpin, Senior Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. A copy of the press release, earnings presentation slides and a replay of this conference call are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at caesars.com. Also, please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of the earnings release to the SEC in a Form 8-K, and will file our Form 10-Q. Before we get underway, I would like to remind you to reference slides 2 through 3, which include forward-looking statements, safe harbor disclaimers and definitions of certain non-GAAP measures. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today's date, and we have no obligation to update or revise them. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to unanticipated hold fluctuations, weather or other unforeseen circumstances that we do not control. There are certain risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed in our filings with the SEC that may impact our results. In addition, Caesars Entertainment closed on the acquisition of Centaur Holdings in the third quarter of 2018. Therefore, U.S. GAAP results do not include Centaur Holdings prior to the acquisition in Q3 2018 unless otherwise stated. The term same-store refers to the performance of our portfolio of properties prior to the acquisition of Centaur and therefore, excludes all Centaur performance. Also note that hold-adjusted results reflects hold versus our expectations. You can find reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP figures starting on slide 21. I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Rodio : Thank you very much, Steve. And good afternoon, everybody. I'm very pleased to join today's call as the incoming CEO of Caesars Entertainment. Over the course of my 38 plus years in the gaming industry, I've worked on 2 separate occasions at Harrah's, so this is somewhat of a homecoming for me. And I couldn't be more excited to return to lead Caesars Entertainment at this critically important time in the company's history. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Caesars and the incredible team members, who are dedicated to serving our guests and creating value for our shareholders each and every day. Over the course of the last several weeks since my appointment was announced, I have been wrapping up my previous role and beginning the process of transitioning to Caesars. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Mark Frissora for his support in making this transition smooth for me as well as for the company. I will officially take up the new role on May 6. In the meantime, I've had an opportunity to begin to speak to members of the senior management team, and I very much look forward to hit the ground running. I've always employed a commonsense management strategy and in partnership with the leadership team, intend to apply the same at Caesars. At the core, we look closely at activities that we are doing today that do not add value, and I want to eliminate those and begin to looking at things that we can do, new opportunities to create value. A combination of the great team of people here at Caesars along with the company's powerful brands, the Caesars Rewards loyalty program and our diverse network of properties provide a strong foundation, on which I'm confident we can build to create even more value. The company has made substantial progress since the conclusion of the restructuring, and I look forward to identifying and working towards additional growth opportunities. As I get up to speed, I will quickly study our operations in detail, and work with the team to identify tactics to profitably -- keyword profitably, grow market share and determine that our operating strategies and marketing mix are optimized to support growth and innovation across the properties and from the corporate center. I want to ensure that we have a culture in which all of our team members think and act like entrepreneurs. That's something our management team here will hear me talk quite a bit about and are collectively invested in our shared success. Before I turn the call over to Eric, I'd like to assure you that I intend to work quickly with the management team to formulate and begin executing a tactical plan. I intend to be very transparent with all of our stakeholders as I can be and will provide relevant updates on our plans in due course. With that, let me now turn the call over to Eric to discuss the Company's financial results. Eric Hession : Thanks, Tony. I'll provide a high level overview of our performance in the quarter and then give a few updates on our business before turning the call over to Joyce to discuss our results in greater detail. Caesars Entertainment delivered a solid start to the year, driven primarily by a healthy consumer demand environment in Las Vegas and our ongoing focus on operational execution. Net revenues totaled $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 7.3% year-over-year, driven by the acquisition of Centaur Corporation and a strong gaming, hotel and food and beverages results in Las Vegas. On a same-store basis, net revenues grew approximately 0.9% as strength in Las Vegas was partially offset by the impact of a heightened competitive environment in Atlantic City and inclement weather across some of our regional properties that drove closures in some instances. Adjusted EBITDAR was $562 million, up 8.5% year-over-year or essentially flat on a same-store basis. Adjusted EBITDAR margin improved 30 basis points to 26.6%, driven by both marketing and labor improvements. On a trailing 12-month basis, our domestic marketing costs represented 19.9% of gross revenue, reflecting a 150 basis point improvement year-over-year, while labor costs represented 23.5% of our gross revenues, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year period. In addition to continuing to improve marketing and labor margins, we achieved record customer experience and service level scores in the quarter. While the majority of the labor-related cost savings that we achieved in recent years has been driven at the property level, where we've reduced headcount by approximately 12% since 2014, in March we completed a corporate cost-reduction initiative. This latest effort is expected to drive approximately $40 million in annualized cost savings. Through the combination of this effort, along with additional efficiency gains across both marketing and labor for the full year, we anticipate being able to successfully offset the $80 million in annualized labor headwinds we cited in our fourth quarter call and thus now anticipate growing margins on a full year basis. Key operational highlights in the quarter include ongoing strength at the recently integrated Centaur properties, continued momentum in growing our sports betting business and the opening of our newest tribal management property, Harrah's Northern California. I'll spend a few minutes providing more detail on each of these. At Centaur, performance continues to provide solid EBITDAR growth as we realize benefits from implementing our Caesars Rewards database and our centralized cost structure. The performance of Centaur remains in line with our expectations, and we've exceeded our internal plan in the first quarter. We're pleased with the progress in -- of pending legislation in the state of Indiana. If enacted, the legislation would enable us to introduce table games earlier than anticipated and would allow sports betting within the state. We remain confident in delivering our continued synergies and achieving our goal of $200 million in EBITDAR contribution from Centaur by July of 2020. We continue to grow our sports betting business during the first quarter as well with the introduction of a new sportsbook at Harrah's Philadelphia Casino and Racetrack, bringing our total number of sportsbooks to 17, with 5 located outside of the state of Nevada. While it's still early days in terms of customer acquisition and market share, we continue to view sports betting as a solid growth opportunity. We anticipate opening additional sportsbooks at our regional facilities in the next 12 months, pending favorable legislation. We have aligned the Caesars Sports brand with some new marquee partnerships. As the exclusive NFL casino partner, Caesars has positioned its casino and resort offerings in front of more than 180 million football fans. The partnership has already begun to pay dividends, as we experienced strong VIP engagement in packages for the Super Bowl and the NFL draft recently held in Nashville. In addition, we're excited about the announcement of our partnership with Turner Sports and the Bleacher Report. We're currently developing a studio in our Caesars Palace sportsbook that will facilitate new content development and it place Caesars betting odds directly into the Bleacher Report app. There is much more to come from this partnership, and we'll share more as it matures. In addition to running our own mobile offering, we also signed a new multistate agreement with DraftKings. Under the agreement, Caesars will offer DraftKings market access for its online gaming products in certain jurisdictions that will generate revenue streams for Caesars in return. Of course, all of this being subject to passage of applicable laws and receipt of applicable gaming licenses. Additionally, DraftKings will promote Caesars as its official resort partner in states where the companies collaborate and will introduce new sports-themed experiences and sports viewing events to be held at Caesars properties. We're excited about the DraftKings agreement, which builds on several other partnerships we've entered into, further strengthening Caesars' position in sports betting. The newest property in our network, Harrah's Northern California, located just outside of Sacramento, opened for business 2 days ago, marking our fourth tribal management agreement. The soft opening went well and was well received as the property reached maximum capacity shortly after opening. We anticipate generating between $5 million and $10 million in annual fees as well as the additional network benefits in Las Vegas and other destination properties in our portfolio. The new property owned by the Buena Vista tribe of Me-Wuk Indians enables us to grow the Harrah's brand and our Caesars Reward Loyalty Program in a capital-efficient way in an attractive new region. Caesars has a long-standing relationship with various Native American communities across Northern America dating back 20 years and believe we're the only gaming operator to renew agreements with tribes multiple times. I'll now turn the call over to Joyce to provide more specifics on our financial results. Joyce Arpin : Thank you, Eric. I will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Please note that our consolidated results include Centaur unless otherwise stated. For the first quarter, we again delivered strong results in Las Vegas, where a healthy consumer demand helped us generate net revenues of $955 million, up 5.8% year-over-year with strength across all verticals. Las Vegas cash hotel revenues grew 7.9% year-over-year with occupancy up 250 basis points to 95% and RevPAR increasing 4.9%. Overall, positive hotel performance was the result of strong group demand, which saw double-digit room night growth and increased leisure demand from growth in direct bookings at caesars.com. The increase in occupancy provided a lift in performance for all business verticals in the Las Vegas segment. Las Vegas gaming revenues increased 6.6% year-over-year due to favorable hold and improved slot volume. Strong revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in table game volumes notably in baccarat as we experienced a softer Chinese New Year versus last year. F&B revenues were up 5.4% year-over-year, primarily due to overall demand from higher hotel occupancy levels, new outlets being fully online and increased banquet revenues. Las Vegas adjusted EBITDAR totaled $360 million, up 12.1% year-over-year or up 3% on a hold-adjusted basis as favorable hold contributed between $25 million and $30 million. Adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 37.7%, up 220 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue growth in a high-margin gaming and hotel verticals. Turning to the other U.S. segments, net revenues totaled $1 billion, up 9.1%, including Centaur, or down 4.5% on a same-store basis. First quarter results were positively impacted by the inclusion of Centaur but partially offset by continued competitive and promotional activity in Atlantic City and extreme weather across our regional portfolio. Our Metropolis and Horseshoe Southern Indiana properties experienced prolonged closures due to flooding. We estimate that weather conditions resulted in headwinds of approximately $32 million for net revenue and $17 million for adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter. Other U.S. adjusted EBITDAR totaled $233 million, up 7.9% or down 11.5%, excluding Centaur. The decline was primarily driven by the net revenue declines in Atlantic City. Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 23.1%, down 20 basis points year-over-year or down 170 basis points, excluding Centaur. Adjusted EBITDAR, excluding both Centaur and Atlantic City, was down 2.5% year-over-year. In the All Other segment, net revenues totaled $150 million, up 4.9% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable hold at our international properties. All Other adjusted EBITDAR loss increased $12 million to a loss of $31 million, primarily due to growth investments in our technology infrastructure and sports partnerships. From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in nonrestricted cash. During the quarter, we generated $255 million of cash flow from operations, giving us the ability to pay off the $100 million balance on our CRC revolver. As of March 31, our total revolver capacity was $1.2 billion. In the first quarter of 2019, we spent a $153 million in same-store CapEx and $65 million in development CapEx. Excluding the convertible notes and capitalizing our REIT lease payments at 8 times, our net leverage now stands at 5.3 times, down 0.2 turns when compared to the year-end of 2018. We remain committed to deleveraging the balance sheet over time and reiterate our gross lease adjusted leverage target of 4.5 times by the end of 2021. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from growth in Las Vegas and continue to be bullish on the city over the long term. In the first quarter, visitor volumes to Las Vegas increased 0.8%, convention attendance increased 1.5% and deplaned passengers increased 2.6%. We view the overall demand environment in Las Vegas as stable, despite the quarter-to-quarter volatility driven by shifts in the citywide events calendar and holidays. In 2019, we continue to expect revenue growth in Las Vegas to be in line with last year's growth and we expect stable EBITDAR margins year-over-year. We continue to see a strong group convention business in 2019. And due to strength in recent bookings, we now expect to generate low double-digit growth in total revenue in this segment. In 2020 and beyond, we see several important catalysts for growth, including the opening of Caesars Forum and the arrival of the Raiders. Caesars Forum is expected to open in April of 2020 and already has over $230 million in bookings through 2025, with more than 90% of those bookings representing new customers. Total bookings for Caesars Forum in 2020 are currently above $70 million. In our Other U.S. segment, we continue to expect growth from Centaur of about $80 million to $85 million versus 2018. This is expected to be partially offset by approximately $40 million of headwind from competition in Atlantic City in the first half of 2019, which we expect to subside as we annualize the impact of this competition in the second half of 2019. The performance across the rest of our other U.S. portfolio is expected to remain stable on a year-over-year basis. Regarding the All Other segment, we expect to generate a larger operating loss for full year 2019 compared to 2018, due to the investments around technology and sports sponsorships that we mentioned previously. We anticipate that the corporate costs related actions taken in March will drive the results in this segment to improve sequentially throughout the year. We will now provide a few qualitative factors to consider in your modeling for the second quarter. In Las Vegas, we expect net revenues to remain in line with the second quarter of '18 and expect to face cost pressures due to increased labor expenses, primarily from union wage increases. As a reminder, in the second quarter of '18, we experienced record performance in Las Vegas with strong top line growth in gaming and hotel. Caesars Palace posted its highest adjusted EBITDAR quarter ever last year. For the second quarter of '19, our Las Vegas expectations, while in line with the second quarter of '18, are tempered by favorable hold in the year-ago period. Our group segment should represent a positive driver in the second quarter as we expect this segment to generate low double-digit revenue growth. In the Other U.S. segment, we expect the contribution of Centaur to more than offset $20 million of negative EBITDAR impact from the competitive environment in Atlantic City. Across the rest of our regional portfolio, we were pleased with our early performance in the second quarter, which reflects the return to a normalized operating environment post the extreme weather of the first quarter. In terms of the All Other segment, we expect to generate revenue growth in the low single digits and to generate an adjusted EBITDAR loss that is in line with the second quarter of '18, as we realize savings from our corporate investments and wind down certain IT transformation projects. For cash CapEx in 2019, we continue to expect a range of $375 million to $450 million for maintenance CapEx, which includes room renovations at Harrah's Las Vegas and Paris. We expect to spend approximately $335 million to $410 million in cash for development-related CapEx, which includes the Caesars Forum project, our cash commitment to Korea and our investments in sports clubs across the U.S. From a GAAP perspective, our Korea joint venture is consolidated. So as a result, we anticipate reflecting an additional $140 million in capital spending on our GAAP financial statement. Before opening the line for the Q&A, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll not be discussing or answering any questions regarding the transaction committee's work. Additionally, while Tony is on today's call, I'd like to remind everyone that he will assume the role of CEO on May 6, and will not be commenting on the committee review process or Caesars' strategy, performance or operations. We can now take the first Q&A question. Operator : We have your first question coming from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Mr. Rodio, congratulations on the new role. Tony Rodio : Thank you very much. Carlo Santarelli : You guys, obviously -- Joyce, certainly a lot of -- very helpful color here around Las Vegas and trends here over the near term. Obviously, there's been a slew of mixed messages coming out of Las Vegas over the broader part of the last year plus. And I was hoping maybe you guys, with a little bit of a different perspective, maybe a little bit of a different business mix in the current environment where it seems as though the high end is what's currently seeing the most pressure, could talk a little bit about what you're seeing beyond, obviously, some favorable demand dynamics and some favorable group dynamics, what you're seeing just broadly that gives you confidence in kind of the near- to medium-term outlook? Eric Hession : Carlo, this is Eric. I would echo your comments that, in general, we believe that the environment in Las Vegas is quite solid. It does have volatility between quarters, as Joyce mentioned, due to shifting holidays and different events. But broadly speaking, we're seeing very good traction on the group side. We're also seeing solid demand from the FIT side and the transient side. As you saw, our occupancies were up 250 basis points to 95%. So there's clearly demand coming in for the hotel and the hotel side. As we look into Q2, we currently have approximately 150,000 non-group room nights on the books, more than the same time last year. So we continue to experience strong hotel demand and believe that, that will translate itself into incremental food and beverage and gaming demand. The patterns for the year continue to be relatively strong. And I think, in general, we are certainly, as a company, more bullish on Las Vegas than I think the overall perception of certainly some in the investing community. Carlo Santarelli : Eric, that's very helpful. And just if I may, back in the fourth quarter what we spoke and you talked a lot about 2019 and trying to more or less baseload, and it seems like, obviously, in the first quarter you've achieved that, in the second quarter you just mentioned a 150,000 non-group room nights already on the books, up year-over-year. As you think about kind of the second half, is that agenda to really get out in front and kind of baseload still part of the playbook right now for the company as you look beyond, kind of, 2Q? Eric Hession : Yes. That's exactly right. We feel that the efforts we started in the fourth quarter and certainly it carried through into the first and second quarter, have performed quite well. You can see the evidence in the occupancy as a headline number, but it -- you'll also see increases in food and beverage and other ancillary spend. We also think that it's better from a risk management perspective because if there are shifts in the economy or we don't anticipate certain gaps from an entertainment perspective having that room nights on the books earlier in the bookings cycle, certainly, we believe, is a better strategy and do anticipate continuing that throughout the course of the year. Carlo Santarelli : And then, if I may, just one follow-up question for Joyce. I know you said 2Q revenues in Las Vegas you felt they would be broadly in line with 2Q \u201818 in the period. You then reminded us a favorable hold last year in the period in Las Vegas. Was there another tidbit that you kind of mentioned that we should be mindful of in 2Q that I might have missed there? Joyce Arpin : Just the continued cost pressures we faced in the quarter will continue into second quarter here in Las Vegas. As you recall, we renegotiated our union contract late last year. So the year-over-year increase in those union wages you'll see in the second quarter. Carlo Santarelli : So, broadly comfortable with 2019 margins staying flat, but 2Q a little bit of pressure and 1Q, obviously, nicely ahead year-over-year, is that accurate? Joyce Arpin : That's right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer from JP Morgan. Dan Politzer : So, my first question is on the regionals and [technical difficulty] in your last call, you mentioned you were launching a number of programs around this time that I think more effectively -- you could more effectively market to your customers. Have you rolled these out yet? And if so, how should we think about the impact of these going forward throughout the rest of the year with respect to the opportunity to reduce your marketing spend? Eric Hession : Yes. We're continually evaluating our various marketing campaigns. We do a lot of test and control, and we make efforts to really identify the elasticity of a particular customer or customer segment so that we can tailor the marketing reinvestment to those customers. We were successful in reducing our overall marketing spend for the company despite having slightly higher marketing spend in Las Vegas due to the increased comp expense. But overall, we were continuing to reduce marketing. We're now below that 20% level, when in 2014, if you remember back, we were around 24%. So we successfully cut it by 400 basis points. There is some technology that we have coming. We recently enacted sales force, which as we continue to put that into production phase and use it for more campaigns, that will help us to do even a better job with respect to the targeted marketing. Dan Politzer : And then, with sports betting, I know you guys have the -- you guys operate in a few different jurisdictions, some brick-and-mortar, some online mobile and brick-and-mortar. I guess can you talk about some of the trends and maybe differences between the markets you're seeing and, I guess, the impact on your properties there? Eric Hession : Sure. We, as you know, the different states have different rules and opportunities to accept sports betting. In New Jersey, we currently have both sports betting at the properties and also online. We're finding good uptake online, and we're also finding that those online customers when they sign up on sports betting are also shifting over into our other online products. So it's a good acquisition tool. For the property betting, we haven't opened our permanent sportsbooks yet. We're opening one on the boardwalk in the middle part of this year. And once those happen, we expect to see much larger increases in terms of the bets taken at the properties. That coincides with similar reaction to what we're seeing in the Mississippi sportsbooks. Those sportsbooks are definitely driving traffic to the properties. Our nongaming beverage and food spend is up, particularly during events where you have high concentration of sports betting people in the properties. But those are proving to be traffic drivers. And then as we mentioned in our remarks, we're very optimistic about the other new states that are either pending with legislation or are currently debating it that ultimately this will be a great traffic driver for our casinos in the regional markets. Operator : We have your next question coming from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Eric, I wanted to start with just free cash flow. I know during the past couple of calls, you've given some general targets in terms of kind of how the model looks in the next couple of years and now given some of the corporate cost changes and CapEx shifts, I was wondering if you were willing to provide just some general targets for free cash flow in the next couple of years, and if anything has dramatically changed since prior calls? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. I would think at this point, our guidance from a free cash flow perspective is the same as it was in prior periods. The improvement in our EBITDA through the cost-cutting will add marginally to that. But our target is to still have roughly $1 billion of free cash flow in the 2021 period, and it'll ramp up considerably starting next year once the CapEx spend for our convention center slows down in the early part of next year. Chad Beynon : And then, on Atlantic City, how is the competitive environment looking? Has the new competition kind of taken their foot off the marketing accelerator? And have you adjusted your business model at all? So if we see the same type of marketing in the higher seasonality quarters 2Q, 3Q, your business could look different? Eric Hession : Yes, we are not seeing much of a change right now unfortunately in terms of the competitive environment in Atlantic City. The first quarter and the fourth quarter are the low seasons in terms of the demand to the city and that certainly impacted us considerably. We are anticipating much stronger demand in the summer months. And as you saw in the third quarter last year, we performed quite well despite the competition, but from a reinvestment perspective, it's still quite high. We have modified our strategy a little bit as we headed out of the first quarter, and as we're entering the second quarter, we've increased our investment modestly. As a portfolio, we were investing about 300 basis points behind the rest of the market and we felt that it was a suboptimal from an EBITDA perspective and so we increased that slightly. Operator : We have your next question coming from the line of Harry Curtis from Instinet. Harry Curtis : Joyce, just going back to the comments you made about the second quarter, you throw all of this into the cauldron and it would seem that it would be at least in Vegas sort of heroic to get to last year's EBITDAR number? Is that right? Joyce Arpin : Yes. Again, that -- it was a record quarter last year, although we still are very bullish on the market and the demand environment and our ability to tap our database, it's going to be tough to meet those figures from a year-over-year perspective. That's right. Harry Curtis : And then in the regional markets, we've seen some companies report their regional results. Can you talk about March and April, particularly, did you, to the extent that you lost business, oftentimes it comes back in 30 to 60 days, did you experience that in March? And then, we've heard some positive rumblings about April as well, a little color on that would give us some sense of the sequential lift, particularly in those markets that were challenged by weather? Eric Hession : Yes. Harry, this is Eric. I would say that March was certainly a good month for us. I think it could be a combination of the pent-up demand that you mentioned from the shutdowns and the weather in February, but also the tax returns came in from the federal government and really hit -- accelerated into that March period. So either way, the conclusion was correct that the quarter for us improves in that March period. And then April has kind of continued to be reasonably solid relative to the prior year periods. Operator : We have your next question coming from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Just maybe to dig in on the labor environment, I just wanted to clarify, were the cost -- the union contract, did that go into effect at the beginning of the first quarter in Las Vegas? Or is that -- does that actually kick in, in the second quarter? I couldn't quite tell given the cadence that was alluded to? Eric Hession : Yes, it was in the first quarter, Shaun. And in addition to just the union contract, we had some other headwinds, such as our 401(k) that we mentioned earlier and some medical costs that affected the broad employee base as well. But all of that compounded, we were successfully able to offset it as you saw a reasonably good flow-through in the company in aggregate in the first quarter. Shaun Kelley : And then, it's sort of the same question, but if we think about the core regional environment and you guys talked a lot about the -- what you've been able to accomplish on the marketing side, but just what's sort of the -- like labor or cost or operating leverage standpoint, let's call it, in the core regional operations and strip out Atlantic City and the outliers, Atlantic City and Centaur for us, just what you're seeing right now sort of cost growth in those markets? And what are -- what kind of headwinds are you fighting, or is it pretty benign? Eric Hession : I think it's market-by-market in the Midwest. There's certainly labor pressure as well, but a lot of it is stemming from -- basically a lack of labor. We're having difficulty finding great talent in a lot of these markets and as a result, that pushes up the price of labor, but it is very market specific. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So just on the high end of Vegas, can you just remind us what your baccarat exposure is? And did the -- the weakness you saw around Chinese New Year, has that extended into the second quarter? And is it a handful of players that have gone away? Or is it kind of broad-based? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. So, we really only take the ultrahigh-end international business here at Caesars Palace. We get a little bit of crossover play at Paris, but it's predominantly a Caesars Palace effect. We generally have between 15% and 20% market share in that big box number in Las Vegas. And so it's -- I believe, it's a little less than some of our peers because we only offer that product really here at Caesars. Broadly speaking, I would say that it's -- customers both came with less frequency and then also when they were here, they spent less. So it was both effects and it was kind of throughout that first quarter and even into the second quarter to some degree. However, I would say, in the second quarter, there's just not as much concentration normally so it doesn't have as big an impact. Thomas Allen : That's helpful. Any way to say how much of like how the quarterly cadence of baccarat is or mixes of baccarat and then just a follow-up question, last quarter you guys said you account for -- you counted 2.5% market growth for Vegas this year. How do you feel about that after seeing first quarter results? Eric Hession : Yes. I don't have the quarterly fluctuations of the baccarat play. I think the best thing to do would be to look at the LVCVA or the gaming board reports and you can see what the market does and we generally trend with the market because it does tend to come over holiday periods. So from that standpoint, that's probably the best answer. And then in terms of our expectation for the full year, our view companywide was that our performance in this first quarter was generally right on kind of where our expectations were. So we haven't varied any of our full year projections at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Just going back to the marketing spend, what does your analysis show in terms of your metrics of marketing efficiency versus some of your peers in that, do you spend more? Do you spend less? And when you think about your margins on, I guess, a tax adjusted basis regionally outside of Vegas, where else do you see opportunities outside of marketing versus the peer set? Eric Hession : Yes. I think, you have to look at it market-by-market. In general, where we do have good evidence as to what others are investing, we tend to be slightly below, I mentioned in Atlantic City, that one's probably the -- has the best disclosure from a state perspective as in terms of what everybody spends, and so that's the best evidence that we have. On a tax rate adjusted margin perspective, we also tend to run on the regional markets kind of right in line with some of the peers. It tends to be more driven by whether you have a hotel and your table gaming component, however, since those are really the labor drivers in those regional markets. And then, as you know, we do lead the strip fairly considerably now in terms of margin relative to the destination here in Las Vegas. Jared Shojaian : Okay. And then just switching gears to CapEx. If I look at your slides, you are now talking to a cash CapEx number, rather than before I think you had a GAAP CapEx number with a difference of $140 million. Maybe you can help me understand the thought there? And then also in the footnote of that slide, you made reference to remaining cash for Korea should the project continue. Am I reading too much into that comment? Or is there an expectation that this might not happen? Eric Hession : Yes. For the first portion of that question, the reason we're reporting the cash CapEx and also referencing the GAAP definition is because of the Korea project. We consolidate that from a GAAP perspective and what we were finding was that it was -- and both analysts and investors were asking a lot of questions and having some confusion about how that impacts our actual cash flow. So the way the project works is that our partners and Caesars invest capital, and we're going to be raising debt financing. So the amount of cash impact to us is what we wanted to highlight to investors. So that was -- it was meant to try to provide some clarity as to our actual cash deployment. In terms of the project itself, as you know, this is a development project in Korea. We have to secure financing. We have to get agreements and have the project come on budget, and so there's always risk associated with any project of that type, and so we just wanted to highlight that as well. Operator : And we have your last question coming from the line of Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Barry Jonas : Just digging into that marketing efficiency a bit more. I think it's been roughly around that 20% mark for three quarters now. Do you think you can continue the pace of improvements you've been able to capture over the past four years or at a certain point, do you run the risk of going too deep? Eric Hession : I think, we are always trying to improve the way that we can market to customers. I think that it would be unrealistic to assume that we can continue the same pace of change that we made over the last 4 years. We did change fairly dramatically the amount that we were giving back to the customers. As we mentioned in Atlantic City as an example, we believe that we can make slight -- more money by slightly increasing our investment to certain segments relative to where our competition is. So, not all of our efforts are designed towards reducing modeling. There is a balance; it just tends on that to be down. Certainly, the technology that we have coming out is going to be able to enhance that. We also have some greater insights into how customers react to the marketing changes that we'll be able to roll out. And so you should expect to continue to see improvement along these lines, but it won't be at the same pace that it was for the last 3 years. Barry Jonas : Great. And then just a question on the maintenance CapEx. Beyond the hotel renovations, you're still having the work. So there are any other areas of meaningful deferred CapEx that you think need to be addressed over the next few years? Eric Hession : No. We don't think that there's anything specifically like there was with the hotel rooms. You can always improve your properties' food and beverage and you can always improve the appearance of the floor and add new slot machines and we try to do that on a measured basis. Right now, we think that we're in a good situation where the continued spending of around that $500 million a year mark is sufficient to maintain all of the properties. We'll be evaluating that and having discussions with Tony as to what the expectations are going forward. And there may be opportunities to invest more into certain markets where customers are willing to spend more with us in return for enhanced capital. Barry Jonas : Great. Congratulations, Mr. Rodio. Tony Rodio : Thank you very much. Eric Hession : Thanks, everybody. That concludes the call. Operator : Thank you, presenters. And thanks to all our participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes our webcast. And you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Tony Rodio : Thanks Steve.I'll provide a quick review of our proposed merger with Eldorado and a high-level overview of our second quarter performance before turning the call over to Eric to discuss our results in greater detail.On June 24, we announced an agreement to merge with Eldorado Resorts to create the largest owner and operator of U.S. gaming assets. For Caesars shareholders this cash and stock transaction will provide immediate cash value as well as the opportunity to participate in the combined company's future growth. Our Board of Directors conducted a thorough evaluation of the path by which we can enhance value the most and position the company for long-term success. They unanimously concluded that this transaction accomplishes those objectives.I'm confident that combining Eldorado is attractive platform of regional gaming properties with our best-in-class Caesars reward program, iconic Las Vegas assets and attractive regional portfolio will result in the creation of a leading domestic gaming platform poised for a long-term success. We are working together with Eldorado to complete this transaction, which is expected to close in the first half of 2020 subject to receipt of shareholder and applicable gaming and regulatory approvals along with other customary closing conditions.Until then, I along with the rest of Caesars management team remain focused on improving the company's operations and financial performance through both revenue enhancing opportunities as well as operating efficiencies. Since joining Caesars in May, I've been impressed with the expertise and professionalism of the Caesars team as well as the quality of our Las Vegas and regional asset portfolio.Room renovations across our Las Vegas assets have been a major driver of our strong performance in recent years. These investments are almost complete and by the end of the year, we will have renovated 92% of our Las Vegas Strip hotel products since 2014 providing us with a highly attractive portfolio of rooms.We're also making a training improvement in entertainment and food and beverage across our Las Vegas properties with new concepts like Vanderpump Cocktail Garden and Jimmy Kimmel's comedy club. The Coliseum at Caesar's Palace is set to reopen in September with Keith Urban. Between the Coliseum and Zappos Theater, we will feature several high-profile entertainers including Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani. Guns N' Roses, Journey, Madonna and Shania Twain among others.Moving to the results during the second quarter, our net revenues totaled $2.2 billion up 4.9% year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Centaur and strong hotel and food and beverage results in Las Vegas. On a same-store basis, net revenues declined 1.2%, strengthen in Las Vegas was offset by the impact of increased competition in Atlantic City and Southern Indiana and unfortunately year-over-year hold.Adjusted EBITDAR was $631 million up 1.3% year-over-year or down 5.1% on the same-store basis mostly due to unfavorable hold in competition. Adjusted EBITDA margins declined 100 basis points to 28.4% driven by the high-hold in the second quarter of 2018. On a trailing 12-month basis, our domestic marketing costs represented 20% of gross revenue reflecting a 90-basis point improvement year-over-year, while labor costs improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 23.5% of gross revenue.We continue to believe that sports betting will be a growth catalyst for the company over the next few years. This year we've seen several favorable legislative decisions allowing us to pursue expansion in this area. We are currently designing and constructing nine sports books across Indiana and Iowa which all are expected to be operational in September of 2019. We intend to develop additional sports books in Illinois, which we hope to have operational once the regulations are in place.Additionally, the United Indian Nation in partnership with us recently opened sports books at Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, New York and Point Place Casino in Bridgeport, New York. We are also pleased that North Carolina has legalized sports betting and we are working with our Cherokee Nation partners to roll out our product as quickly as possible.Our footprint now totals 20 source books across four states and we expect to be operational in seven states by year-end. During the quarter, several states passed gaming legislation that directly impacts our operations. In Indiana, we are very excited that our Centaur properties will be allowed to offer table games starting in 2020. We are expanding our footprint to incorporate table games and training dealers in anticipation of dealing our first card at 12 :01 a.m. on New Year's Day.In Louisiana, we are working towards finalizing a 30-year extension to operate Harrah's New Orleans through 2054. In order to obtain the extension, we will invest $325 million in the property by 2024 to improve the facility, add new restaurants and add a new hotel. We believe this is a great outcome for the city of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana and our business.Finally, the state of Illinois enacted legislation allowing significant gaming expansion in a largely saturated and high tax jurisdiction. As a result, we expect our existing properties in Illinois and Northern Indiana to feel the effects of the gaming expansion over the next several years.I'll now turn the call over to Eric to review our financial results in more detail. Eric Hession : Thank you, Tony.I'll discuss our second quarter results in more detail. Please note that our consolidated results include Centaur unless otherwise stated.For the second quarter, our Las Vegas business delivered solid performance. Net revenues were $1.0 billion up 1% year-over-year with strength in our hotel and food and beverage products. Las Vegas cash hotel revenue grew 6.3% year-over-year, occupancy increased 370 basis points to 97.5% and RevPAR increased 6.2% year-over-year.In the second quarter of 2019, we established record performance for both cash hotel revenue and occupancy breaking the records previously established in the first quarter of this year. Overall positive hotel performance was a result of strong group demand, which saw double-digit room night growth and increased leisure demand from growth in direct bookings at caesars.com. The increase in occupancy provided a lift in performance in food and beverage as well. We believe our performance is indicative of a healthy consumer environment in Las Vegas and expect hotel demand to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year.Las Vegas gaming revenues decreased 6.1% year-over-year due to $18 million in unfavorable year-over-year hold. However, we're pleased that total gaming volume increased 3% year-over-year with table games volumes up 1% and slot volume up slightly more than 3%.Food and Beverage revenues were up 5.7% year-over-year primarily due to higher hotel occupancy levels and the improvements we've made to our offerings in the last few years. Caesars Palace drove most of the increases with strength coming from Hell's Kitchen, the newly opened Vanderpump Cocktail Garden as well as in banquets.Las Vegas EBITDA totaled $389 million up 1.1% year-over-year or up 5.9% on hold adjusted basis as unfavorable hold was a headwind versus prior year, but not significantly different than our expectations. EBITDA margin expanded to 38.8% up 20 basis points year-over-year driven by revenue growth across the hotel and food and beverage verticals.Turning to the other U.S. segment, net revenues totaled $1.1 billion up 8.4% including Centaur are down 4.8% on a same-store basis. Second quarter results are positively impacted by the inclusion of Centaur, but partially offset by continued competitive and promotional activity in Atlantic City and Southern Indiana and to a lesser extent Iowa and Pennsylvania.Other U.S. EBITDA totaled $270 million up 4.7% or down 10.9% when excluding Centaur. The same-store decline was attributable to the net revenue declines I noted earlier. EBITDA margin was 25.4% down 90 basis points year-over-year or down 170 basis points excluding Centaur. EBITDA excluding both Centaur and Atlantic City declined 2.4% year-over-year. In the all other segment, net revenues totaled $156 million up 7.6% year-over-year primarily due to an increase in net revenue at managed properties partially offset by decreases in table game volumes at our high-end international properties. All other EBITDA loss increased $10 million to a loss of $28 million primarily due to costs associated with our sports betting partnerships.Looking ahead, we believe we're well positioned to benefit from growth in Las Vegas and continue to be bullish on the city over the long-term. In the second quarter visitor volumes to Las Vegas increased 0.9%, convention attendance increased 0.7% and deplane passengers increased 3.6%. We view the overall demand environment in Las Vegas as stable despite quarter-to-quarter volatility driven by shifts in the citywide event calendar and holidays.With respect to Las Vegas for the full year of 2019, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in line with last year and expect modest EBITDA margin expansion on a year-over-year basis despite the labor headwinds we noted in previous quarters. We continue to see strong group in convention business and expect this customer segment to generate low double-digit growth in both total revenue and in room nights.In 2020, the opening of Caesars Forum represents a major growth opportunity not only for Caesars, but for Las Vegas as well. Caesars Forum already has over $290 million in cumulative bookings. Total bookings in 2020 are currently over $80 million well ahead of our expectations. In our other U.S. segment, we continue to expect a positive incremental contribution from Centaur, which will be partially offset by the competitive pressure experienced in Atlantic City in the first half of 2019.We expect the competitive impact of Atlantic City to subside as we annualize the impacts in the second half of the year. The performance across the rest of the portfolio is expected to remain stable on a year-over-year basis.Regarding the all other segment, we expect to generate a larger operating loss for the full year 2019 compared to '18, due to investments in technology, infrastructure and our sports sponsorships.We will now provide a few qualitative factors to consider in your modeling for the third quarter. In Las Vegas, we expect to benefit from a continued healthy consumer demand with strength in the FIP segment. We expect net revenues to increase slightly and EBITDA to grow low single digits on a year-over-year basis. As macro trends continue to weigh on the international segment, we expect to see continued weakness in this consumer. We expect our group business to exhibit typical seasonal weakness in the third quarter as group revenue is expected to be flat with low single-digit growth in room nights.In addition to traditional seasonal weakness, Las Vegas third quarter performance will be negatively impacted by the closure of the Coliseum at Caesar's Palace and Harrah's Mardi Gras tower room renovation. We expect to complete the renovation for the Coliseum in September and the Mardi Gras tower in December. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a strong rebound in the group business which will allow us to grow group revenue and room nights in the low double digits for the full year.In the other U.S. segment, we expect a mixed environment across our regional portfolio as certain regions remain more affected by competition than others. Annualizing the competitive effects in Atlantic City and benefits from strong growth at Centaur will help to offset the continued negative impacts in southern Indiana, Iowa and Illinois due to competition. Excluding the impact of Centaur, we expect the other U.S. segment adjusted EBITDA to be flat on a year-over-year basis.We expect Centaur to remain a strong overall growth driver despite annualizing the acquisition in the third quarter as we continue to extract additional synergies and upside from the legalization of sports betting in Indiana.In terms of the all other segment, we expect to generate revenue growth in the mid-single digits and to generate adjusted EBITDA loss that represents a sequential improvement from the second quarter of 2019. The sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA will come from the realization of savings from our corporate investments and the wind down of certain IT transformation projects partially offset by investments in our sports partnerships.From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash. As of June 30, we had nothing drawn on our revolver and had the full $1.2 billion in capacity available. In 2Q '19, we spent $161 million in the same-store CapEx and $55 million in development CapEx, excluding the convertible notes and capitalizing our REIT lease payments at 8x, our net leverage stands at 5.3x.For CapEx in 2019, we continue to expect a range of $375 million to $450 million for maintenance capital, which includes room renovations at Harrah's Las Vegas and Paris. We expect to spend approximately $475 million to $555 million for development related CapEx mostly related to the Caesars forum project and our investment in sports books across the U.S.Before we open the call for questions, please note that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our second quarter performance, while we look forward to answering any questions you have about Caesars, for more information regarding the proposed merger with Eldorado please refer to our filings with the SEC.With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Carlo Santarelli : [Technical Difficulty] for the comments Tony you've had a couple months now under your belt, and I was just wondering kind of as you think back on the last several months and your observations of the company. What is it that has surprised you and maybe more importantly, how do you think about, what you've learned thus far and the opportunities that some of your learnings present? Tony Rodio : Thank you very much for the question. I would say what's pleasantly surprised me overall is our performance in Las Vegas in general and more specifically our performance from a room standpoint in Las Vegas. As Eric mentioned in his comments, we had a record cash revenue at a hotel in Las Vegas in the second quarter, which exceeded our record that we had in the first quarter. I think the capital dollars spent on rooms over the last number of years have really paid-off and we're really excited about the future outlook in that vertical as well.In terms of where I think there are opportunities, I think mid to longer term here in Las Vegas I think that our East Side properties, the properties on the east side of the strip across from Caesars Palace, I think provide opportunities if you look at places like Flamingo and Valleys with their large room supply, we don't do very well from a food and beverage revenue per available room there. And I think it's because of the lack of some compelling amenities. So, I think we have an opportunity to do some things and add some non-gaming amenities there to drive traffic.Longer term we have a ton of vacant land behind those Eastside properties that provide a great opportunity for us. And then, quickly from a regional market standpoint I think that we could also probably add some compelling non-gaming amenities at certain larger properties. But I also think we could be a little bit strategic, more strategic in the deployment of our marketing dollars to hold onto our customers and win some profitable market share back. Carlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And then, would you guys mind just kind of maybe a little bit of an update on kind of how you're thinking about the [Korea] [ph] project at this point in time. I think you guys have maybe $180 million or so in your CapEx or in the CapEx in general. Could you guys kind of talk about where that stands? Tony Rodio : Well, it's certainly a focus of ours. We've got $80 million that we put into it to-date. Certainly, the first month and a half we've been focused on, we were focused on the merger and then our properties and our business here in the U.S. and that's going to be a focus of our attention over the next month or two to come up with a recommendation for the Board and I'll let Eric weigh in if he's got anything additional. Eric Hession : Yes. The only thing I'd add Carlo is that the number that you referenced in terms of the CapEx is because we're consolidating that entity. Our maximum future contribution to the project is $60 million and that would be the amount of the cash out from our balance sheet that we would contemplate in the entirety of the project. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. All right. Thank you, guys. Tony Rodio : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Good morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color upfront both Eric and Tony. Eric if you could -- could you just give us a little bit more color on the core regional performance, first was a clarification I think you said something along the lines of the second half performance being flat on a core basis excluding Centaur. But, I wasn't sure if I caught that correctly/ And then, maybe if you could just talk about the environment a little bit more broadly in terms of what you're seeing out there and the trends would be helpful. Tony Rodio : Yes. What you summarized is correct. Excluding Centaur, we anticipate during the third quarter that our portfolio be broadly flat. We're certainly seeing some unanticipated competition in locations such as Iowa with the new tribe that's opened up. And then, with the VLTs continuing in the Illinois and starting to affect some of the Hammond area there in Indiana. But overall, I would say that the regional portfolio excluding Atlantic City some markets are performing better, some markets are worse. But I wouldn't say there's been a real change in trend.For this quarter, we happened to be down a couple percent in terms of EBITDA adjusting for those, but for the year we're anticipating it to be about flat. Eric Hession : Yes. I mean, I would agree and also some competitive headwinds in southern Indiana with the instant racing games across the river. But, I think if you look at it from a longer-term view, we have a ton of upside in Indiana with the Centaur properties with the addition of table games that are going to get here a lot quicker than we thought and the resolution of the long-term lease in New Orleans provides us with a great opportunity in the longer term. And I mean call me crazy, but I think we can improve things in Atlantic City a little bit I think that we've underperformed there, and I think that there's an opportunity for us to turn those results around. Shaun Kelley : Thanks for both. Maybe just as a follow-up to elaborate on that last point a little bit. Just maybe a little bit of an overview on. I'm sure there's a decent amount of planning that's going to be done, but timing for the investment in New Orleans and maybe a little bit on scope like number of hotel rooms you'd be targeting there. And then, for the table just any thoughts on underwriting expectations on the upside potential there would be helpful? Tony Rodio : In terms of New Orleans, the capital investment has to happen, and I forget it was [2024] [ph] And there's also a limit to the number of rooms that we can add and I believe it's in the 400 and some room range. But again, I apologize for not knowing the exact number but that we're in the planning stage now and I would think that the deployment of that capital will begin probably in the second half, the latter part of 2020. And again, it's got to be done in the next four to five years anyway. What was the\u2026 Eric Hession : I will just add Shaun that, we do expect pure returns from that capital to be kind of above 10% below 15%, so in that range in addition to be able to secure the license extension. So overall, we think it's a great deal, like we said for both the city the state, but also for us as a company. Tony Rodio : Yes. I mean we're buying tens of thousands of rooms in New Orleans each and every year. And this will allow us to reduce that costs pretty significantly. So, we view this as a real big positive. Shaun Kelley : Great. And just any comments on it. Thank you given some prior -- I think when you underwrote the Centaur deal a little bit of color there. But any color there. That's it for me. Eric Hession : Any color on the Centaur property? Shaun Kelley : No. On the table game upside. Sorry. Eric Hession : Yes. The table games. Sure. Based on our experience from seeing other markets where they've introduced table games from a competitor perspective but also from us when we did it in Pennsylvania. We expect to see about $40 million of incremental EBITDA from the introduction table games at the two properties. As of right now, we're continuing to progress very well from a performance perspective even absent the table games and our tracking right on if not slightly above our business case that we put together when we bought the properties.In addition to the positive table games Tony mentioned the sports betting opportunity. And beyond that we own five OTBs that we acquired with the purchase of Centaur. And we're anticipating being able to open those as well. So, we all have seven sports books in the state of Indiana running very shortly. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : Just a clarification on Slide 5, when you talk about the Las Vegas performance. I mean how did that gaming volumes are up 3%, but then gaming contribution on revenue is down $1 million, could just talk about the disconnect there? Thank you. Eric Hession : Is that year-over-year? Good. Well, we held it. I know we had 20% back in 2018 and 10% back this year and overall table hold went from 19% to last year to 15% this year. So, our volumes were up, but our win was down pretty significantly and it's just a function of bad luck or great luck last year. Thomas Allen : That excludes hold. So, anything else going on, is it like the promotional environment, is it the mix of games potentially? Tony Rodio : Yes. It's a mix thing that we're talking about. So, we had a very strong [background] [ph] volumes. And then, we had lower other table games volumes. And so that caused the volume on the table game side to be up slightly, but the theoretical expected win to be slightly lower than that.On the slot side, we had slot volumes up approximately 3%. And there's really not much variability on the slot side from a mix standpoint. Thomas Allen : That\u2019s helpful. Yes. That makes sense. And then, just talking about Vegas in general you highlighted having a really strong convention calendar for the second half of year and some seasonality there. Just on the bank calendar, how is it shaping up for you guys versus last year for the back half of the year? Eric Hession : Really well. I mean we feel good about our booking pace and the trends that we're seeing. And then, in on more of a longer-term view, I mean we think that there is a number of positives that are going to increase demand as we go into 2020. In addition to the forum over the next couple of years. You've also got the Raiders coming to town, obviously, the expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center as well as the MSE sphere. And then, ultimately once the merger is complete we've got four pretty significant metropolitan areas that'll get plugged into Caesars rewards as well that will also add to the demand. So, we think the prospects look very strong. Thomas Allen : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is now open question. Barry Jonas : Question. Just you noted some costs on the sports betting partnerships this quarter and next quarter maybe just talk about your expected ROI and timing of when we might see that? Tony Rodio : Yes. The costs are coming in associated with our deal with ESPN Bleacher Report and the NFL. We're expecting in the back half of this year when the NFL season comes along that will really start to see some share improvement because we've been investing in that channel up until now.We also have the opening of ESPN broadcasting booth right on the Las Vegas Strip at the link that will open later in the year as well. And then finally next year we'll have the draft here in Las Vegas with a preponderance of the events at our facilities. And so we're very excited about that. Eric Hession : We view those as certainly longer-term investments that we're not going to get returns on right up front. But, as we expand sports betting in the more jurisdictions and leverage the popularity of the NFL and having a team here in Las Vegas we certainly think that they're going to pay big dividends down the road. Barry Jonas : Got it. And then, apologies, if I missed this, but in the presentation, you noted that hold had a $10 million to $15 million impact for revenue, but a $15 million to $20 million hit to EBITDA. So, what was the flow through so high? Eric Hession : Yes. It depends on the jurisdiction and the tax rate associated with it. So, we have two properties that have a lot of volatility. Obviously, Caesars Palace here in Las Vegas, but also our London club's operation. And as you know, the tax rate here is very low and the tax rate in London clubs is very high. So, you can have more than 100% flow through based on the mix shift of where that hold happened. Barry Jonas : Okay. Understood. All right. Thank you so much. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi. Good afternoon everyone. I wanted to just follow up on Las Vegas for a moment. There's been so much discussion about the issues of resort fees and parking charges and finding other ways to generate growth beyond just room rates. Can you just talk about what you're seeing and what your strategies are regarding those issues in Las Vegas today. Tony Rodio : Well, we're certainly seeing them continue to escalate. I think one of our competitors just announced an increase as well. I look at that as -- is something that we need to be a little bit cautious about as continuing to escalate those because I think that over time at some point there's going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I don't think we're there yet. But, I want us to be very judicious and as I said cautious about taking those rates any further. I mean it's certainly a revenue stream that's hard to walk away from and that it's been accepted to this point. But, I think we're getting we're getting pretty high. Eric Hession : Yes. The only thing I'd add is that we had RevPAR growth of 6.2% this quarter. We had very strong RevPAR growth last quarter as well much faster than the rest of the United States. For both us and for my city as a whole. And so, I don't think that the resort fees and the parking fees are inhibiting our ability to grow the rates. We hit 97.5% occupancy up 380 basis points. So, we really don't have a demand problem at this point with respect to interest of people coming to Las Vegas. Tony Rodio : Yes. The other thing, I would add that on top of that is that, if and when there is any kind of economic downturn I think that those things will be felt a lot more by the consumer at that point than in New York today where the demand is so strong. David Katz : Got it. And I. My follow-up question is, Tony that you made the remark that you think there is room for improvement in Atlantic City. Could you elaborate on that just a bit and talk about what strategic levers you think are available? Tony Rodio : I mean if you just look at our performance of the same-store properties that operate in Atlantic City, the seven of them before ocean and hard rock opened. I think that we have underperformed Part 3 properties have underperformed the other four in totality. So, if those other properties can figure out a way to hold onto market share to some degree and to do it in a profitable basis, I certainly think Caesars Entertainment should be able to do it.We reinvest 300 basis points lower than the market average. And I'm not suggesting that we need to go out there and spend significantly more than we are. But, I think that we can be very strategic about testing some things to change customer behavior and win back some of that lost market share and that would be number one.Number two, I would say that we have particularly at Caesars Atlantic City not so much at Harrah's, but I think that we could be deploying a little bit more capital dollars to create some incentives in some non-gaming amenities that give people a reason to come and visit our properties. If you look at the properties that are successful and I think [indiscernible] turning it around a little bit. It's properties that have reinvested in the experience and I think that we have failed to do that over the last couple of years. David Katz : Got it. Thank you very much. Eric Hession : Thanks Dave. Operator : Your next question is from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : Hey, good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, I appreciate all the modeling help on the back half. I think last call you indicated in expectation that margins for the full year would grow for the entire business. Are you feeling better about that target after getting through the second quarter here and would you expect both the third quarter and the fourth quarter which show margin expansion. Eric Hession : Yes. We did mention last quarter that we thought the company as a whole would have slightly higher margins then we do feel confident as we head into the back half of the year with that. If you notice this call, we did also call out that we expect Las Vegas margins to be modestly higher. And last quarter, we weren't as confident in that. We felt like we have very good momentum. The verticals that we're talking about from the hotel standpoint and the gaming standpoint are very high margin verticals. And so, to see those grow gave us a lot more confidence in terms of the margin here in Las Vegas. But, as a company as a whole, yes, we continue to expect to see margin growth for the rest of the year. Tony Rodio : Also, we're being very judicious as we have some attrition about replacing bodies particularly here at corporate where we're evaluating each and every departure and through the review those in the last three months. We recognize almost $15 million worth of annualized savings there. We're also looking at scaling back some of our participation games to the tune of about $10 million there. So, there's a few other cost initiatives that we're engaged with that it's going to allow us to take some cost out of the business. Jared Shojaian : Great. Thank you. And then, with respect to asset disposition activity would you consider monetizing any of your assets over the next several months, if the opportunity was right or is your thought to leave the current portfolio as is for now? Tony Rodio : Well, we're reviewing things as we would whether we're heading into a merger or not. Well, we have some inbound inquiries periodically and there's a few that are more interesting than others and we'll continue to follow-up on those and if we think something makes sense then we'll present it to our Board. Jared Shojaian : Great. Thank you very much. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your line is now open. Daniel Adam : Hi. This is Daniel Adam on behalf of Harry Curtis. Just one question to the extent you can comment on it. And Tony, I think you remarked on it just before, but the cost reduction effort in anticipation of or ahead of the closing of the Eldorado acquisition, where do you currently stand and what is your expectation over the next six to 12 months? Thanks. Tony Rodio : Right now, the initiatives that we've already undertaken have us in the $25 million savings standpoint. We'll continue to review replacements particularly here at corporate as we move forward. And there's some other initiatives in terms of some outside contract and consulting fees that we're going to look to reduce as well. I hate to put a dollar amount on it, but knowing that we've already gotten to $25 million, I would anticipate by the first quarter of next year that that number will grow to something north of 50 -- something in that range. Daniel Adam : Okay, great thanks. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Operator : There are no question in queue. Presenters, you may continue. Tony Rodio : Okay. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it. Operator : Thanks all for joining us today. We hope you found this podcast presentation informative. This concludes our webcast. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

Tony Rodio : Thank you, Joyce. I'll provide a quick overview of our third quarter performance and recent developments before turning the call over to Eric to discuss the results in greater detail.First, a quick update on the merger with Eldorado. We filed our definitive proxy on October 11 and the shareholder votes for each of the companies will occur on November 15. We made significant progress on the integration planning and we remain on track to close in the first half of 2020.Turning to the results; third quarter net revenues totaled $2.24 billion up 2.3% year-over-year driven by growth across all of our business verticals and favorable hold in Las Vegas. Net revenues grew 0.7% year-over-year, adjusted for hold. Solid consumer demand in Las Vegas drove the higher revenues as we saw increased slot and table volumes, including an 18% increase in baccarat volumes and an increase in hold and hotel occupancy and ADR.Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $638 million, up 6.3% year-over-year driven by revenue growth and corporate expense reductions in payroll, professional services, legal expenses and risk management. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points year-over-year to 28.5%.We are very pleased that we were able to deliver these strong results in the third quarter despite headwinds across our portfolio, including road closures in Indiana, which impacted visitations at Hoosier Park and Indiana Grand, also the temporary closure of the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and rooms at Harrah's Las Vegas for renovation and a decrease in demand at our [inaudible].On a trailing 12 month basis our domestic marketing costs represented 20.1% of gross revenue, reflecting a 20 basis point improvement in marketing efficiency year-over-year, while labor costs represented 23.4% of gross revenue, reflecting a 60 basis point improvement in labor efficiency.In September we announced an agreement to sell the Rio for $516.3 million. The sale of this asset allows us to focus our capital resources on strengthening our portfolio of the Las Vegas Strip properties and is expected to result an incremental EBITDA growth at those properties.Importantly, we continue to have more marking rights for our valuable seasonal rewards customers and we\u2019ll retain hosting rights to the World Series of Poker. We expect to close the sale by the end of 2019 subject to customary closing conditions. For the sale agreement we will continue to operate The Rio for a minimum of two years pursuant to a lease agreement to be signed at closing, and the property will remain part of the Caesars Rewards network during that lease period.We continue to grow our sports betting business across the third quarter and are pleased with the progress we've made over the past year. We've recently expanded Caesars sports books to Iowa and Indiana and now have Caesars branded sports books across 29 locations in seven states : Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Iowa, Indiana and New York.Mobile sports betting is already live in Nevada and New Jersey and we expect to launch in Pennsylvania pending regulatory approval. The new sports books are driving increased visitation and customer engagement across our portfolio and we expect sports betting to be a key value driver for the company over the coming years.Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric to review our financial results in more detail before getting to your questions. Eric Hession : Well, thank you Tony. Please note that our consolidated results include Centaur unless otherwise stated. As Tony mentioned, Las Vegas results were strong in the third quarter. Net revenue totaled $973 million, up 6.9% year-over-year due to strength across all business verticals from favorable customer demand.Gaming revenues increased 17% due to $37 million of favorable year-over-year hold in increased gaming volumes. Total gamming volumes increased 2% year-over-year. Table volumes were up 2.5% led by baccarat up 18% and slot volume were up 1.7%. Las Vegas cash hotel revenues grew 8.1% year-over-year, making the highest third quarter Las Vegas cash hotel revenue in company history. Recall that we also achieved similar records in Q1 and Q2 of this year.Occupancy increased 290 basis points to 95.6% and RevPAR increased 7% to $140. We experienced strong growth in the room nights from the group's segment and from direct bookings on our website and the leisure segment. We continue to see a healthy consumer environment in Las Vegas and expect hotel demand to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year, specifically with cash paying customers.Food and beverage cash revenues increased $5 million or 2.5% year-over-year, primarily due to higher hotel occupancy levels and recent enhancements we made to our offerings. Caesars Palace saw the largest increase driven by the new Vanderpump Cocktail Garden and other premium outlets like Hell's Kitchen.Las Vegas EBITDA totaled $356 million up 16% year-over-year or up 4.5% on a hold adjusted basis. EBITDA margins expanded 290 basis points to 36.6%, driven by the solid revenue growth.Turning to the other U.S. segments, net revenues totaled $1.12 billion down 0.5% as approximately $25 million of favorable impact from two additional weeks of Centaur results versus the prior year period was offset by unfavorable hold of $11 million year-over-year, and the increase in competition Atlantic City and Southern Indiana.In addition, construction disruption as we moved our casino from a boat to land in Southern Indiana impacted results. This move is expected to be complete in the December. Other U.S. EBITDA declined 1.9% to $304 million due to the decreases in revenues, but was up 1% to $309 million on a hold normalized basis. EBITDA margins contracted 40 basis points to 27.2%. On a hold normalized basis, our Atlantic City properties EBITDA was flat year-over-year.Our all other segment, which includes unallocated corporate expenses, managed properties and our international operations had net revenues of $144 million, down $6 million or 4% year-over-year, primarily due to decreases in table games volumes at our international properties. All other EBITDA loss increased $5 million to a loss of $22 million, due to lower performance at our London Clubs operations, which was partially offset by a reduction in corporate expenses year-over-year. As Tony noted, we reduced payroll, IT and professional services expenses in the quarter.Looking ahead, our outlook in Las Vegas remains positive based on future demand indicators and results we've seen to-date. In the third quarter visitor volumes to Las Vegas increased 0.6%, convention attendance increased 8.3% and deplane passengers increased 3.9%. In the fourth quarter we expect continued low single digit revenue growth in line with year-to-date hold normalized growth trends and we expect margins to improve slightly year-over-year.We view the overall demand environment as stable and modestly growing, led by non-gaming segments. Recall that we faced lower leisure demand in the latter half of last year and tapped our database to stabilize occupancy. This year in the fourth quarter we are seeing stronger demand from cash paying customers, which will increase hotel cast revenues year-over-year. We\u2019re also seeing a strong quarter in group bookings and we expect double digit growth in room nights and high single digit growth in group revenues for the fourth quarter.Sure, we anticipate an acceleration in Las Vegas led by our Caesars Forum Convention Center which is scheduled to open in March. Caesars Forum already has over 1.1 million room nights booked and $390 million in revenues through 2026, 75% of which are in the first three years of operations. Total bookings for the forum in 2020 are currently over $90 million, well ahead of our expectations.In the other U.S. segment, we anticipate net revenues to grow low single digits and margins to improve slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with Centaur remaining a strong overall growth driver, despite annualizing the acquisition in the third quarter.We expect to continue to extract additional synergies and expect a positive lift in the fourth quarter from the recent legalization of sports betting in Indiana. Additionally we expected December completion of the Southern Indiana boat to land project marks the end of an 18 month renovation rebranding effort to transform the property into a premier Caesars asset.In the all other segment we expect to generate a larger operating loss for the full year compared to 2018 due to investments in technology infrastructure, our sports sponsorships, and weakness in our international business. In the fourth quarter we expect sports investments to increase, which will be partially offset by labor savings.From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash. As of September 30 our total revolver capacity was $1.2 billion with zero drawn. In the third quarter we spent $106 million in same store CapEx and $78 million in development CapEx.During the quarter we also used excess cash to voluntarily repay $250 million of the CEOC term loan, bringing the balance down to $1.2 billion and our enterprise wide gross lease adjusted leverage down to 5.8x. Excluding the convertible notes and capitalizing our lease payments at 8x, our net leverage standard 5.3x.For cash CapEx in 2019, we now expect a range of $400 million to $420 million in maintenance, which includes room renovations at Harrah's Las Vegas. We expect to spend approximately $275 million to $295 million for development related CapEx, mostly for the Caesars Forum project and our investments in sports books across the U.S. This range excludes spends for the Korea projects which we are currently evaluating.Before we open the call for questions, please note that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our third quarter performance. While we look forward to answering any questions you have about Caesars, for more information regarding the proposed merger of Eldorado, please refer to our filings with the SEC.Operator, we\u2019ll open the calls for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Your first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, thanks everyone and nice performance in the quarter. Tony, if I could, you obviously talked a lot on the last call about some of the efforts that you guys have collectively made in terms of cost reduction and obviously based on the performance in the quarter, it seems that some of that stuff is flowing through. To the extent you can kind of talk about where you are in that process and what you are kind of targeting at this stage and a timeline for it, I think that would be very helpful. Tony Rodio : Okay, thanks Carl. Yeah, on the last quarterly call I think I had mentioned that it was my goal to take $25 million to $50 million worth of cost out of business by the time we got to the closing of the transaction. I'm happy to say today that I would now make that estimate somewhere between $75 million to $100 million and I think it's going to be on the higher end of that, and it comes in a variety of buckets.From a property standpoint we've eliminated a number of slot participation games across the whole portfolio. We've also reduce consultants and outside contractors and professional services. We\u2019ve suspended our international efforts and pursuits for licenses in Japan and other jurisdictions, and then just natural attrition particularly here at corporate as people have left. We take a very cautious approach about filling those positions. We don't want to hire people into harm\u2019s way, if it's a position that may be part of a larger synergy down the road.And then lastly, few weeks ago we launched a voluntary severance program which we had approximately 50 people raise their hand here at corporate, which again allows us to eliminate the cost between now and the closing, but we were able to allow them to take the benefits they would have gotten if they had stayed through closing. So I think it was a win-win for everybody.So again, I would say now it's about $75 million to $100 million. And we are beginning to see it flow through, but I think you'll see more of the flow though as we get into the first quarter, because a lot of those voluntary severances, they will be allowed to accept them over the course of the next couple of months. Carlo Santarelli : Great! Thank you and then something a little bit more detailed, I guess probably best for Eric. You talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks. When you \u2013 based on kind of prior experience and I know you guys have done this before, but with respect to the Southern Indiana boat, obviously you know during the disruptive period here, we\u2019ve certainly seen from a gross revenue perspective some decline. Can you talk a little bit about, the impact that you foresee on a year-over-year basis, maybe to the extent you can EBITDA, even if it\u2019s on a percentage basis, just in terms of the uplift you foresee from the cost saves, as well as what you would have expected to be, a stronger revenue performance. Eric Hession : Yeah, it is a great question, and we do have experience as we\u2019ve moved other properties from the boat to land. There are two real drivers; one is on the cost side, you no longer have to maintain the boat, which includes sometimes captains and dredging expenses and so forth, and so the downside of the project from a return standpoint is really limited and you can get about a 6% to 8% return simply by looking at the costs that you're pulling out of the business by moving from both the land.Then on the other side you create a much better environment for your customers, both from the field perspective and also in the gambling perspective of the casino, and what we\u2019ll typically see there is a ultimately another kind of 5% to 10% change. So we target around a 15% return on these projects and that I have no reason to expect that we wouldn\u2019t be able to get that. Tony Rodio : And the only color I would add to that as well, there is a little bit of noise in that market given the competitive effect of Derby, Kentucky BLT. Thank you. Carlo Santarelli : Great! Thank you very much guys. Tony Rodio : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. Thomas Allen : Hey, so big news in the quarter as you sign The Rio. Can you just talk about what kind of loss EBITDA you think that that's going to generate for Caesars? Thanks. Tony Rodio : Well, I mean I think we anticipate being able to maintain the vast majority of that. I don\u2019t know Eric if you have an exact number in terms of what our forecasts were, but the ability to retain World Series of Poker, being able to retain our Caesars Rewards customers, and still managing the property for the next two years, we think that a lot of that business is just going to be transferred over to our other eight properties in Las Vegas. Thomas Allen : Okay, and then on Atlantic City, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I believe you said that hold adjusted EBITDA was flat in the quarter. How did that compare to expectations and kind of what\u2019s the outlook for your AC segment going forward? Thanks. Tony Rodio : Well, my expectation is that we begin to turn that around. I mean Atlantic City certainly from the last number of quarters and since the new competition opened has been going in the wrong direction, and before you can turn something around and move it in the right direction, first you have to stop the decline and I think we've accomplished that. We are testing some new marketing initiatives that are more targeted towards specific customers, decliners and inactive and customers that we feel we've lost market share to our competitors. So I'd like to think that we're going to be able to show improved trends there over the balance of the fourth quarter, and more importantly into 2020. Thomas Allen : Helpful, thank you. Tony Rodio : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open, please go ahead. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon everyone. You guys some great color on just the overall Las Vegas operating environment and maybe some of the core or future KPIs. I was wondering if you do a little bit of the same, just sort of the regional markets. You know I think Eric you mentioned or maybe it was you Tony, a little bit about Centaur and some of the progress there. Is that and kind of Southern Indi going to be the primary drivers for growth in 2020, any other pluses and minuses and just what are you seeing broadly speaking in terms of the \u2013 call it the core regional consumer at this point. Tony Rodio : Number one, the upside at the two Indi properties as a result of the phase 1 of tables coming online and we do think that we'll see growth there in a couple of phases, because we're not going to be able to fit many table games in to either of those businesses as we would like, so in the second phase we\u2019ll have to include an expansion of the buildings, but certainly upside at the Indi properties in 2020.The boat to land as you mentioned is also going to be a driver. We think that we're going to continue to upside as sports betting continues to spread across the country and then probably not in 2020, but in New Orleans we view as a lot of upside with the extension of our lease and the $325 million that we're going to deploy there, that we have to deploy by 2024.Additional rooms there, we run at 100% occupancy. We buy 30,000 to 50,000 rooms from non-gaming hotels in the market and we have somewhere in the vicinity of 100,000 with [inaudible] every year, so we have a lot of upside at New Orleans, but again that probably won't be 2020.As far as the headwinds, there are definitely some competitive headwinds, totally live as expected to open. Not for the latter part of 2020, but that'll affect both Philly and AC. We've got gaming expansion in Arkansas and Oklahoma and then the VGT expansion continues in Illinois, as well as the historical rating games in Kentucky. Shaun Kelley : Great, thank you very much. And then, you know sort of your latest update on the direct marketing side and some other reductions you\u2019ve been able to deploy there. Just kind of where are we in your \u2013 kind of in your general strategy there? You know is that going to be sort of modest incremental improvement from here or sort of any kind of new programs or initiatives that you\u2019re excited about, understanding that it's a bit of a transitional period to roll out anything too new. Tony Rodio : Yeah, I think that it's more continuing to do business as usual. I think the guys here, the marketing team have done a fantastic job with you know \u2013 there's always some exceptions are allies and again, I would reference Atlantic City as one of those, where I think that we kind of weren\u2019t as aggressive as we should be in the face of the new competition. So by and large across the other regional markets and here in Las Vegas, we are continuing to test new programs. We're even doing some testing here in Las Vegas, but there's not going to be a wholesale dramatic change to our marketing approach from a direct marketing standpoint. Shaun Kelley : Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question is from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open, please go ahead. Harry Curtis : Hi, good afternoon. You guys have mentioned favorable hold in the other sector of about $11 million. So does that imply that the favorable hold impact in Vegas was around $26 million? Eric Hession : No, it was the other way Harry. Sorry, we had a negative of about 11, that's on a year-over-year basis in the regions and then positive of 37 in Vegas, so net positive of around 25 for the company. Harry Curtis : I see, I misunderstood. Tony Rodio : And if I could just add some color onto the Las Vegas results, because I don't \u2013 we definitely had a favorable hold, but I don't want that to minimize the tremendous results we had across the whole portfolio in Las Vegas.As Eric mentioned in his comments, for the third straight quarter we had record hotel cash revenue, and you would think that would come at the expense of gaming volumes, because we're putting more cash customers in the room, but we were able to grow our slot volume and our table volumes by 2%. Our baccarat volume 18%, food and beverage revenues continue to escalate and we continue to do very well from an entertainment standpoint.Overall because of the closure of the Colosseum for two months, it wasn't quarter-over-quarter up, but on event-by-event basis its certainly up and we just had for example Guns N\u2019 Roses in the Colosseum and with the changes that we made to the facility, it's a great customer experience. We're able to do more throughput in terms of beverage sales and you know the bookings for next year are very exciting to look forward to from an entertainment standpoint. So I think overall Las Vegas is just \u2013 I think we're doing extremely well. Harry Curtis : Yeah, we agree with that. I did want to sneak in another follow-up question, particularly as it pertains to the 18% lift in baccarat, which is kind of an outlier. Do you think that you guys were taking share or do you sense that there is a stabilization in the baccarat market. What do you think accounts for the outperformance other than brilliant management? Tony Rodio : Well, I agree with that, but it's not from my standpoint. The first and foremost I wanted to give credit to the management team here at Caesar's palace. They've done a great job, them and their Asian marketing team, cultivating and creating relationships with that business. As a matter of fact we\u2019re just coming back from a business trip over there to do just that very thing.I think also the capital dollars that we\u2019ve deployed with our villas, those experiences I think are second to none. I don't know what the exact numbers are. I\u2019d have to believe that that 18% is a bit of a steal of share, as well as growth, but I think it comes mostly from the senior management team here at Caesar's palace and the Asian marketing team. Harry Curtis : And last question, just turning to sports betting. So far in the 29 books that you've got operating and then the mobile live in New Jersey and Nevada, how much accretion if any or how close are you to EBITDA creation as a result of sports betting and maybe you could delineate between those states that have mobile and those who don't, which don't. Tony Rodio : Like sports betting in and of itself, its certainly driving incremental EBIDA, but I think that that's the smallest component of what we're benefiting from as a result of the sports betting legislation.If you look at a property like Hammond, leading up to us, opening the sports book revenues for the few quarters before that had been down a point or two. In the two months since we've opened the sports book, our revenues are up around 4%. We're seeing significant lift in our food and beverage sales; we're seeing a significant lift in foot traffic, our gaming volumes are up as a result. So yeah, we're making money one sports betting by itself, but we're making even more money because of all the traffic it's creating. Eric Hession : Yeah, and we're seeing it across the board. If you look at the books that we opened in Iowa, if you look at the ones in Mississippi and in Indiana, they're all having similar effect, some larger magnitude than others, but there's no question that they are definitely influencing customer visitation trends and have a direct impact on the amount of food and beverage that we\u2019re selling. Harry Curtis : Got it! Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead.David Katz, your line is open. Tony Rodio : I think we lost David. Operator : We\u2019ll move on. Barry Jonas from SunTrust; your line is open, please go ahead. Jeff Stantial : Hey guys, this is Jeff Stantial on for Barry. Just curious, you mentioned some puts and takes earlier for 2020. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the competition coming online later in the year in Indiana with the Gary project, and then thinking through into later next year, into 2020 and beyond, some of the new builds in Illinois. Just curious of your thoughts on those. Tony Rodio : Well, certainly I think that those are also headwinds as well. I mean I think the good thing is it appears to be some political uncertainty about the gaming property and the license in downtown Chicago, which I think would have the greatest impact. I don't know if we\u2019ve forecasted the impact from Gary, but it certainly is going to be a little bit of a headwind and the expansion of adding \u2013 going from 5 to 6 VGT\u2019s in Illinois is going to impact our businesses beyond Gary \u2013 I mean, Hammond, Joliet, as well as Metropolis.I think the bigger impact on the VGT isn\u2019t the six unit. I think the bigger impact is that customers can wager more and win more. I think it makes it a more compelling and enticing product for people who just want a convenient gaming option. Eric Hession : The only think I\u2019d add to that is broadly speaking when we look across the entire portfolio and we're in the middle of our plan process for next year, we do see less competitive disruption this coming year than what we've experienced this year and the prior year. It just happens to be concentrated in the markets that you called out, but broadly speaking it's less than in prior years. Jeff Stantial : Okay, great, thanks. That\u2019s all from me. I appreciate the color guys. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Operator : Thank you to all our participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes their webcast and you may now disconnect. Have a great day!",

The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements.In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. Please refer to slide 21 through 26 that which includes forward-looking statements, Safe Harbor disclaimers and definitions of certain non-GAAP measures and slides 12 to 16, which include tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP figures.I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Rodio : Thanks, Joyce, and thanks everyone for joining. We have what we believe is a really good story and we\u2019re excited to share it with everybody. I\u2019ll provide a quick overview of fourth quarter and full-year performance and recent developments before turning the call over to Eric to discuss our results in greater detail.First, an update on the merger with Eldorado. On November 15th, stockholders from both Caesars and Eldorado approved the merger of our two companies. Additionally, we received regulatory approvals from a number of jurisdictions and are making progress toward obtaining approval from other jurisdictions in the coming months. We continue to make progress on the integration planning and expect to close the transaction in the first half of 2020.Now the results, Caesars delivered another strong year of operating performance, starting with the fourth quarter, net revenues totaled $2.2 billion, up 2.6% year-over-year driven by strength in Las Vegas and growth across all regions, primarily in Iowa and Indiana due to the opening of new sportsbooks.Solid consumer demand in Las Vegas resulted in higher revenue, primarily within our Hotel segment, as we saw a higher cash customer mix versus the prior year and an increase in occupancy.Adjusted EBITDA was $586 million, up 3.4% year-over-year, driven by revenue growth and corporate expense reductions in payroll, professional services and legal expenses. Excluding the sale of Rio, adjusted EBITDA totaled $575 million, up 4% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points year-over-year to 27%.For the full-year, enterprise wide net revenues were $8.7 billion, up 4.2% year-over-year, driven by strong performance and favorite hold in Las Vegas and a full-year of Centaur results. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.42 billion, up 4.7% over the prior year. Hold adjusted EBITDA was $2.4 billion, up 2.9%.Our domestic marketing costs were 20% of gross revenue reflecting a 10-basis-point improvement year-over-year, while labor costs represented 23.4% of gross revenue reflecting a 30-basis-point improvement.As a result of our focus on cost controls, we\u2019ve removed approximately $100 million of annualized expenses since the start of 2019. We\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019re able to deliver these strong results that close the year 2019.We also have closed the previously announced sale of Rio in Las Vegas to dreamscape companies in December and received $470 million in cash. In January, we announced the sale of Harrah\u2019s Reno to CAI Investments for $50 million of net proceeds, which will be split 75% the VICI and 25% the CaesarsIn addition to capital investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years have paid off as we\u2019re seeing good results from these various projects. Since installing table games at both Centaur properties and opening Southern Indiana\u2019s new land based property. All three have increased gross gaming revenue by 35% to-date, tracking well ahead of our expectations.We\u2019re also excited about the opening of Caesars forum here in Las Vegas in March, which has exceeded bookings and revenue expectations to-date. For its first full-year of operation Caesars Forum has already booked over 240,000 room night and $119 million in revenue. We also book more than $1.3 million room nights representing $460 million in revenue so far through 2026.We also continue to grow our sports betting business across the quarter and are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made over the past year. We now have 29 seasons branded sportsbooks across seven states.As a result of these installations, we have seen an increase in visitation, food and beverage engraving buying particularly in Iowa, Indiana, and Mississippi. We have licenses approved to launch mobile sports betting in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Iowa, and plan to do this over the course of the first half of this year subject to regulatory approval. We reiterate our view of sports betting as being a key value driver for the company and anticipate expanding our footprint to more markets over time.As we looked at the first quarter of 2020, we are seeing an acceleration of the performance that we saw in 2019. Las Vegas is performing very strong with gaming volume exceeding our expectations, up 9% in January, and non-gaming generating solid performance as we continue to see strong customer demand. In addition regional properties continue to perform well, due to the addition of sports betting and capital investments I mentioned earlier, and our focus on cost controls.Now I will turn the call over to Eric. Eric Hession : Thank you, Tony. Please note that our consolidated results include Centaur unless otherwise stated. As Tony mentioned, we generated strong Las Vegas results again in the fourth quarter. Net revenue totaled $989 million, up 4.2% year-over-year due to strength across all business verticals, as we saw favorable customer and demand.Gaming revenue increased 1.4% primarily due to the higher mix of cash customers in the hotel this year versus the prior year. Las Vegas hotel revenue increased $9 million or 3.2% year-over-year, while occupancy increased 120 basis points to 95.1% and RevPAR increased 2.1% to $141.9. Despite the addition of 26,000 more room nights available compared to prior year.We experienced more demand from our FIT customer segment and double-digit year-over-year growth within our group segment. As of today, we continue to see a healthy consumer environment in Las Vegas and expect hotel demand to remain strong.Food and Beverage revenues increased $8 million or 3.1% year-over-year, primarily due to higher hotel occupancy levels and enhancements in our offerings. Caesars Palace saw the largest increase driven by the new Vanderpump Cocktail Garden and Hell\u2019s Kitchen, as well as an increase in banquet revenue due to the higher Hotel Group mix. Hell\u2019s Kitchen has performed extremely well since opening, generating almost $40 million of revenue in 2019 alone.Other revenues grew $19 million year-over-year, mostly due to an increase in entertainment revenue from higher ticket sales and prices for shows at the newly renovated Colosseum at Caesars Palace, and also at the Flamingo.Las Vegas EBITDA totaled $363 million, up 3.4% year-over-year, or up 3.9% -- sorry, 3.6% on a hold adjusted basis. The performance was due to the increase in revenues offset by an increase in operating expense related to the Rio rent expense equal to $3.8 million.Due to the short-term nature of our lease agreement to manage the Rio rent payments will be recognized as an operating expense instead of as an interest expense for financing obligation. As a reminder, the annual rent for the Rio is approximately $45 million or $11.25 million per quarter going forward. Excluding the Rio, Las Vegas EBITDA totaled $352 million, up 4.5% year-over-year.Turning to the other U.S. segments, net revenues totaled $1 billion, up 1.8% year-over-year driven by strength across all markets. Notably, as Tony mentioned, Indiana and Iowa generated solid performance primarily due to our new sportsbooks that drove higher visitation, which in turn translated into higher gaming volumes.Our southern Indiana land based property opened in December and we also saw an increase in gaming revenue due to strong demand for the new asset. Other U.S. EBITDA increased 7.8% to $248 million, or up to 7.3% on a whole normalized basis due to increased revenues and excellent cost controls.EBITDA margins improved 130 basis points to 24%. The Atlantic City properties EBITDA improved by $4.5 million over the prior year due to higher revenues across verticals coupled with improved operating expenses.The all other segments includes our unallocated corporate expenses, CIE managed properties and our international operations. Our all other segments net revenues totaled $148 million, down $4 million or 2.6% year-over-year, primarily due to decreases in volumes that are international properties.All other EBITDA loss increased $11 million to a loss of $25 million primarily due to a $10 million increase at our high end international properties, and a $15 million increase in our sports betting partnership investments, all of which were partially offset by a $7 million increase in CIE performance and a $7 million reduction in labor and consulting expenses that corporate.Looking ahead, our outlook as of today in the Las Vegas and in the regional markets remains positive based on demand indicators and the results we\u2019ve seen today. We believe the overall demand environment is improving with continued non-gaming growth leading the way. We continue to anticipate a strong 2020 in Las Vegas led by the Caesars Forum Convention Center, which is scheduled for open in March.We also expect the addition of the CON/AGG Conference in March, the NFL Draft in April, which will be hosting in front of the Caesars forum, and the Raiders home games in the fall to provide a meaningful boost for visitation within the city. We look forward to continuing to activate our strong partnership with the NFL, as they bring the draft and the Raiders to Las Vegas.From a liquidity perspective, we ended the year with approximately $1.8 billion of unrestricted cash. As of the end of December, our total revolver capacity was $1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, we spent $136 million and maintenance CapEx and $76 million in development CapEx primarily consisting of spend for Caesars forum and the sportsbooks.Before we open the call for questions, please note that the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our fourth quarter performance. Well, we look forward to answering any questions you have about Caesars for more information regarding the proposed merger with Eldorado. Please refer to our filings with the SEC.Now, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hi. Thank you, Tony. Eric, thank you for the color. Just in terms of, clearly, today yesterday Coronavirus, front of mine for everyone unfortunately from a market perspective and I just wanted to ask kind of several part question. For starters, are you guys seeing anything in kind of the last few weeks that has impacted or changed visitation, change behavior as it pertains further to booking trends and what you\u2019ve seen in your bookings for out periods, namely from international regions? And, then lastly, is there anything you guys are doing at present at the property level to potentially further safeguard from any issues? Tony Rodio : Yeah. Thank you for the question, it is obviously on top of everybody\u2019s mind. To-date, we are pleased and pleasantly surprised say that we\u2019ve seen no business impact whatsoever. As matter of fact, we\u2019re off to a great start in 2020 from our VVIP business from Asia. And I credit that Gary Selesner and his Asian marketing team. They do a great job of cultivating that business. They take a number of trips each year and they spent quite a bit of time there in December and they had teed up what they thought was going to be a real strong first quarter from that segment and that has come to fruition.Going forward, we have a number of metrics in dashboards and items that we track on a daily basis to see if we get a precursor to any downturns. And again, I\u2019m happy to report that we have not seen that yet. We are working on contingency plans, should the situation begin to affect business here, but again, so far, so good. Carlo Santarelli : And then, Tony, if I could follow up on, I think, you mentioned 240,000 room nights this year associated with the convention center and $100 million of hotel room revenue on the books associated with events, or sorry, maybe not this year, in the year post opening. Tony Rodio : Yeah. Carlo Santarelli : How much of that\u2026 Tony Rodio : Go ahead. I am sorry. Carlo Santarelli : No. I was just going to ask how much of that is incremental relative to stuff that was maybe previously contemplated at other venues or is that just kind of $100 million of incremental revenue on top of what you\u2019d be doing in some of your other venues? Tony Rodio : I don\u2019t have the exact percentage, but I can tell you that the vast majority of that is incremental. We have seen a little a bit of a follow up at the properties. But collectively between what we\u2019re booking there and what we\u2019re seeing at the individual property convention spaces, we are still well above our forecasts. Eric Hession : The only thing that Carlo is that the revenue of $100 million includes both the room revenue and the bank revenue component. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, Eric. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelly from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelly : Hi. Great. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Maybe to build off the same kind of exposure question on thinking about maybe the high-end business, it sounds like, Tony, you mentioned the business doing exceptionally well right now. But I think for investors sort of knowing a little bit of exposure across to a large company would be helpful. Could you give us a little bit more color both on kind of Las Vegas and I think this is pretty concentrated at Caesar\u2019s Palace, as well as in the more of the International piece of the business. Any ballpark metrics or anything you give us to think about or quantify exposures for that kind of VVIP or high-end Asian play, I think, would be helpful? Tony Rodio : And I\u2019m going to get her to correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe our overall profitability for the whole company it\u2019s around 1% that comes from the VVIP business in Asia. But having said that, it\u2019s off to a great start in 2020, so I would say through the first quarter, it\u2019s going to uptake from there. Eric Hession : So it\u2019s not a huge exposure. Our bigger concern going forward depending upon which way this Coronavirus goes. If we start to see cancellations of the domestic travel to Las Vegas for the fear of interacting with Asian clientele, but again, we have not seen that to-date, and obviously, we haven\u2019t had any cases of the Coronavirus here in Las Vegas. Shaun Kelly : Sure. Great. And then my other question is beyond maybe the broader operating expense landscape. I mean, at least versus our expectations looks like, the regional properties I think did very well on margins this quarter with market growth. The Las Vegas piece is probably a little bit slimmer. But these numbers can bounce around quarter-to-quarter. So just maybe, Eric, or Tony, your thoughts on the broader labor cost environment? What did he call it out a little bit earlier at the beginning of the year and also just how much more room you have on some of the operational improvements to kind of drive margin growth. I think you\u2019ve done some stuff on professional expenses and things like that? Tony Rodio : Yeah. I mean, look, we have made -- I think our operating entities operated real good margins today, and as I mentioned on the call, we improved our marketing efficiency, as well as our labor efficiency. I talked about the $100 million in costs that we\u2019ve taken out of the business, the lion\u2019s share of that has come from the corporate structure, although the major components of that I think there\u2019s $11 million or $12 million that we\u2019ve taken out of the individual businesses by reducing our slot participation games and we\u2019ve gotten good results particularly in the regional markets where we don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s impacted as well. So we\u2019re actually looking at a second phase of taking more of those games off the floor.In terms of corporate, it\u2019s come from a number of areas just through attrition. We did that voluntary severance plan. We eliminated our pursuit of a license in Japan. And we -- I think we\u2019re doing a much better job of controlling our IT functions and looking at what efforts we really need to pursue and we\u2019ve scaled down a number of projects that we\u2019re actively working on. So that\u2019s allowed us to reduce our contract labor by quite a bit. So -- and we continue to evaluate through attrition or all the opportunities here at corporate. But I would say, between now and merger, the lion\u2019s share of it is already been harvested. Shaun Kelly : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Politzer from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Dan Politzer : Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk broadly about the level of inbounds maybe that you\u2019re still getting on some of your gaming assets specifically on the strip, and maybe what the buyer pool kind of looks like there? Tony Rodio : Quite frankly, inbound for script properties is pretty much non-existent, where our phones are open and willing to take calls, and if we get a call, we certainly would evaluate it to see if it makes sense for the business as a strategic decision. But right now, from a script standpoint, there were no active discussions and have had no inbound inquiries. Dan Politzer : Okay. And then just pivoting to sports betting, can you tell us maybe about the impact you\u2019ve been seeing across properties, I know you mentioned you called out $69 million in additional EBITDA at Iowa and Indiana, but I guess to what extent is that being driven directly by sports betting versus being more of a function of increased visitation and maybe crossover play? Tony Rodio : Yeah. Well, first of all, the sports betting itself outside of Las Vegas is not a -- and I don\u2019t have the number with me, I want to say, within the $6 million range of profit or why that was generated from the sportsbooks themselves. However, we\u2019ve seen significant increases in visitations that is driven incremental food and beverage revenue and incremental gaming revenue.I know in particular Biloxi, Mississippi, for example, we\u2019ve seen it sounds crazy -- we\u2019ve seen a 300% increase in cash beverage sales since the sportsbooks have opened. So it\u2019s doing exactly what I think everybody anticipated and increasing the foot traffic through the properties and having a positive impact on all verticals plus adding its own EBITDA into the mix as well. Dan Politzer : Okay. Then maybe just the last one on Centaur. Is there any update on the timing for sale leaseback and have you started to have any conversations with VICI or maybe even inbounds from other REITs. Tony Rodio : No. No update on the timing there and no active discussions. Dan Politzer : All right. Great. Thanks so much, guys. Tony Rodio : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : Good afternoon, everybody. Just a follow-up on your comment about the inbound strength of Asian play. It\u2019s a tough question to ask, but given the fact that it\u2019s so contagious, what health precautions are you taking? Tony Rodio : Well, that\u2019s the thing I mentioned, we\u2019re looking at contingency plans and operational plans right now. We\u2019re actually looking to work together collectively here in the market, as well as with government agencies, and I can\u2019t tell you that we have everything ironed out right now, but we are embarking on those types of plans as we speak. Harry Curtis : Thank you. And my follow up question is, so -- it was -- is related to the $100 million of expenses that you have taken out. What is the annual increase in just your union contract costs that offset the expenses coming out? I\u2019m interested in what a net savings is, if you\u2019re seeing expenses elsewhere? Tony Rodio : Well, first of all, I would tell you that the $100 million is a complete net savings because those increases would have happened regardless. Number one. Number two, we budget for on an annual basis, and again, Eric, correct me if I\u2019m not exactly right, I mean, the 2% to 3% increase for salaries across the whole portfolio, including union and we typically come in under that. So I don\u2019t know if we have a broken out as far as how much of that is union? Eric Hession : Yeah. We generally don\u2019t provide that information and we look at it in more aggregate and we include things like energy pricing, which recently has been going the other way, as well as the wages, but a lot of it is the benefits and other extra expenses associated with just running the business from a cost perspective. When we put our budget together, we estimate those and then try to find ways to offset them through costs, savings and other areas. Harry Curtis : Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to go back to a topic that you touched on earlier around sports betting. And Tony, I was listening carefully to some of the commentary around F&B increases, which are substantial, but somewhat fundamentally different from an increase in GGR. Do you have any specific statistics around growth in or improvement in GGR as a result of sports betting rolling out? And my follow-up, whichever at the beginning is have you been able to measure any of the total rewards loyalty members that are engaging in sports betting or any background on that yet? Tony Rodio : Yes. The one thing that\u2019s been really encouraging is that a number of the people that have been engaging in sports betting in those Midwest and South jurisdictions are people that were inactive. She\u2019s rewards customers previously. And so we\u2019ve seen a lot of reactivation of those customers, and they also are giving us other gaming work in addition to that.We\u2019ve seen roughly about a 10% increase in foot traffic through the properties that have sports books. I can\u2019t -- it\u2019s so hard to dissect. If we see an uplift in GGR, it\u2019s so hard to say well, how much of this is related to sports betting and how much of it is relating to other marketing initiatives or what else are improvements in weather year-over-year.And particularly if you look at, Centaur properties in Southern Indiana, we had major capital investments there and we\u2019ve seen incredible results. So there\u2019s a lot of noise. So it\u2019s hard to put your finger on exactly how much more GGR. But I can tell you, it\u2019s typically around 10% more foot traffic that we\u2019re seeing in these properties. David Katz : And if, I mean, it\u2019s certainly not in any way taking pocket share away from GGR and towards sports betting, as far as you can tell? Tony Rodio : No. Definitely not. No. We -- it\u2019s definitely accretive incremental GGR that we\u2019re seeing from the people that, again, we\u2019re getting a lot of customers that had been our customers in the past that are now coming back to the properties, particularly in those markets where they have to come into to make the wager. David Katz : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Barry Jonas from SunTrust. Your line is open. Barry Jonas : Great. Thanks. I guess I\u2019d start with Vegas results for the quarter. I think overall result were better than we had modeled, but flow through was perhaps a little bit lighter than we\u2019d expected anything you\u2019d call out there on the flow through side? Tony Rodio : We had a number of items that came in the last quarter or the year that we don\u2019t necessarily think would repeat themselves that put a little bit of pressure on the flow-through. I think, per Shaun\u2019s question earlier, there is a more volatility in the flow-through here in Las Vegas, due to the mix of revenue, as it shows up whether it\u2019s in the casino or the hotel or the food and beverage.And for the year, our margins were up approximately 120 basis points and we achieve 37.5% margin here in Las Vegas. So, broadly speaking, I think, the flow-through is good for the whole year and as we look into next year, we -- there may be some volatility again between quarters, but for the year, we would expect great flow through again. Eric Hession : Yeah. And the other thing I would add is going into 2020, a lot of the cost savings initiatives, we really didn\u2019t get the full like the voluntary severance program that I mentioned earlier, a lot of those people didn\u2019t exit the company until the end of the year. So we\u2019re not seeing the full benefit of the whole $100 million until 2020 and I think it\u2019ll creep higher than that as we get closer and closer to the transaction. Barry Jonas : Okay. I mean, I guess, how much of that $100 million do you think was actually recognized in 2019 just to be clear? Eric Hession : I mean, we didn\u2019t really get started until the second half of the year. I don\u2019t have that number. But -- if I had to measure a guess I\u2019d probably say $25 million, $30 million, $35 million. I got a number of the people in the room shaking their head, yeah. So I think that\u2019s a good estimate. Barry Jonas : Great. Great. And then Tony, you talked about reductions to the participation footprint. Just curious, if you\u2019re offsetting that was any slot purchases and I guess while you\u2019re at it, curious what the\u2026 Tony Rodio : Yeah. What we\u2019ve seen it\u2019s really worked for us is when we replace the participation games with newly acquired product and new product and the results that we\u2019re getting at the new product is almost as doing, as well as the participation games.There\u2019s been a couple of locations and a couple of isolated situations where it\u2019s a little bit more competitive, where we think that it hurt us and we\u2019re adding back, but the net number is going to continue to go up, because we\u2019ve seen much more positive results due to that then negative. Barry Jonas : Great. Great. And then just last one, it gets clear Vegas is a strong setup for 2020, but curious when your thoughts beyond that, several new properties and entertainment venues are going to be coming online after that, just curious how you think about more than medium- to longer-term setup. Tony Rodio : Well, look, I would argue or could argue that the more catalysts for additional traffic is only going to help everybody. A rising tide lifts all boats, I mean, the MSG Event Center is going to, I think, I mean, help even more -- I mean, even though resorts were -- I am not exactly sure when it\u2019s coming online, but that\u2019s going to create more interest in traffic into the city and you\u2019ve got the expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center. So I view them all as positive. Barry Jonas : Great. Thank you so much, guys. Tony Rodio : Thank you. Operator : Thank you to all our participants for joining us today. We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes our webcast and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Joyce. You may begin. Joyce Arpin : Thank you. Good afternoon. And welcome to the Caesars Entertainment Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today from Ceasars Entertainment are Tony Rodio, Chief Executive Officer and Eric Hession, Chief Financial Officer. A copy of the press release, earnings presentation slides and a replay of this call are available in the investor relations section of our Web site at caesars.com. Also please note that prior to this call, we furnished a copy of the earnings release to the SEC in a Form 8-K, and we'll file our Form 10-Q shortly.Before we get under way, I would like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. Please refer to Slide 17 through 22, which include forward-looking statements, safe harbor disclaimers and definitions of certain non-GAAP measures, and Slide 11 to 12, which include tables reconciling GAAP and non-GAAP figures.I will now turn the call over to Tony. Tony Rodio : Thanks, Joyce. And actually, before I start my formal comments, I think it's worth noting, me and Eric are sitting here in the conference room at Caesar's Palace, and we are over six feet apart. But being in Caesars Palace, which usually has so much activity and energy and it's kind of theory and hopefully in the not too distant future, we'll be beginning to move back to normal.With that said, first and foremost, all at Caesars hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. The public health emergency caused by COVID-19 has created challenging circumstances that are impacting all aspects of society.Before I provide commentary on the steps we're taking to protect our business and to prepare to reopen when appropriate, I'd like to express my gratitude to all of our team members who are on the frontlines of our efforts to quickly and safely implement the closure of all our casino properties in March, consistent with stay at home orders, and other directors from various governments and tribal bodies. I'd also like to thank those who remain on the job to keep our properties safe and secure while closed. I know the implementation of these directives have placed extraordinary strain on all of our people.Throughout this period, our focus centered around the health and safety of our employees and guests. We began temporarily closing our properties in North America on March 14th and by March 17th, we had shut down almost all of our properties in North America and internationally consistent with government or tribe mandated directors. The challenges we now face are uncertainly around when our properties will be able to resume operations, what that will look like and how consumers will react once we reopen, as well as preserving liquidity as best we can.In the meantime, we're taking steps to prepare for reopening at the appropriate time and to strengthen our financial position. Given the unprecedented scale and scope of this public health emergency, we can't reliably predict when consumers will be ready to return to our properties. Though we believe our deep connection with our guests and our geographic diversity positions us as well as possible.We're working closely with regulators and government and tribe officials to ensure our operations upon reopening follow their directives. We're also consulting with health experts regarding the implementation of policies and procedures that align with recommendations published by public health officials.In an effort to strengthen the company's financial position and enhance our ability to recover when we do reopen, we made the extremely difficult but necessary decision to temporarily reduce our workforce to a smaller targeted workforce on maintaining basic operations. We have furloughed approximately 90% of employees at our domestic own properties as well as at corporate, and we look forward to welcome them back at the appropriate time.In the interim, we've taken steps to support our team members, including paying impacted employees for the first two weeks of the closure period and enabling them to use their available pay time off after that, as well as paying 100% of their medical insurance premiums through the earlier of June 30th and the return to work. Furlough team members will also have government assistance available to them as a financial bridge until they do return to work.Additionally, an employee assistance fund, Caesars Cares, has been established to support team members at our domestic properties who suffered unanticipated hardships arising from COVID-19. The fund, which is run by an independent public charity and managed by a three person board, includes two independent directors and the Caesars representative. It\u2019s composed of donations from Caesars Board of Directors, executive team members and other employee, as well as partners and vendors.During these extraordinary times, we are committed to continue to support local communities where we operate by owning perishable items to food bank and charities and providing critical supplies for first responders. To-date, Caesars has supplied hundreds of thousands of pounds of food, as well as thousands of gloves, masks and bottle of hand sanitizer to those on the frontlines. Additionally, we have contributed cots, hundreds of bed linens, pillows and hygiene kits to various homeless shelters and care facilities.Based on the company's ongoing efforts to address COVID-19 related need and the communities where we operate, donations made by the Caesars foundation will support local charities in these communities engaged in fighting this public health emergency. We continue to seek ways to give back as part of our commitment to get through this together. We've been communicating regularly with our customers during this challenging period, including working hard to alleviate the concerns of Caesars reward members about the program by ensuring the benefits they receive are protected.We've also worked closely with our broad family of talent, including entertainers, chefs and our own bartenders to provide entertainment and recipes, and other information to people while they are at home. As we think about the path toward reopening, we will make decisions in collaboration with local governments, tribal authorities, gaming regulators and health experts, among others, with the health and safety of our employees, guests and community in mind.We will ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable government directives and tribal mandates. While we don't know the duration or the severity of the economic downturn stemming from this public health emergency, we recognize that a recovery will take time. We will be thoughtful and responsible in terms of how we bring the business back. In locations with multiple properties, we plan to phase openings in line with demand and our contractual commitments.We are designing and implementing policies and procedures in consultation with an infectious disease specialist that align with recommendations from the U.S. CDC and local public health officials to guide the reopening of our currently closed facilities, as well as ongoing maintenance of guest areas and team member work areas.As you would expect, our health and safety initiatives include, among other things, an increased frequency of cleaning and sanitizing of public spaces and guest rooms, more frequent hand washing by team members, requiring team members to wear masks while at work, implementing social distancing in areas where they're aligned in the gaming area, including limiting table game spots and slot machines. Additionally, non-gaming offerings, including entertainment, restaurants and malls will likely be reopened on a phased basis with limited capacity in line with consumer demand and guidance from public health authorities. You can find further details on our health and safety approach in the announcement we put out today.Before I turn the call over to Eric, I'd like to briefly comment on a couple of business updates. A few weeks ago, we and Vici Properties announced the sale of Bally\u2019s Atlantic City to Twin River\u2019s Worldwide Holdings for approximately $25 million in cash. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. Bally\u2019s Atlantic City will continue to be part of the Caesars Award Network until closing. Following the sale, we will continue to operate Caesars Atlantic City, which will include the Wild Wild West Casino and Sports Book operation and Harrah's Atlantic City. Lastly, in terms of our pending merger with Eldorado, we remained focused on closing the transaction.Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric to review the financial details of the quarter. Eric Hession : Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to echo Tony's previous comments and hope that you're all safe and well.I'll start by providing some details on our Q1 performance and then discuss specifics regarding our balance sheet and overall financial position. Our first quarter performance can be divided into two parts, January and February and then the month of March. For the first two months of the quarter we posted our best operating performance since 2008, reaffirming our success in executing our strategic initiatives and our strong momentum prior to the emergence of COVID-19. Net revenue through February was up 12% year-over-year, driven by increases in all verticals across all regions, highlighted by strength in Las Vegas and Indiana.Adjusted EBITDAR for the first two months of the quarter increased 28.7% year-over-year, demonstrating the operational discipline and efficiency that we've established. However, circumstances changed dramatically in March with the stay at home orders and the temporary shutdown of our network, causing net revenue for the month to come in 56% lower than the prior year. While our properties were only open for part of the month, costs in March were generally in line with the prior year as we took steps to support our team members as Tony discussed earlier. As a result, Q1 adjusted EBITDAR declined 46.3% to $302 million or 49.5% decrease on an hold adjusted basis, outpacing the 13.6% drop in revenue to $1.8 billion.Looking at results by segment, performance in Las Vegas was off to a strong start in Q1. Net revenue and adjusted EBITDAR reached all-time highs for the first two months of the quarter with net revenue increasing nearly 10%, driven by growth across all business verticals and adjusted EBITDAR rising 20% year-over-year. Temporary property closures over the last 15 days of the quarter, however, led to declines in gaming hotel, food and beverage and other revenues, resulting in 13.9% year-over-year decline in Las Vegas net revenue to $822 million.We saw a significant increase in cancellations of hotel and convention reservations during the quarter due to the property closures, Q1 occupancy decreased to 77.5% from 95% in Q1 '19 as March occupancy was less than half the prior year. While room rates fell just 1.4% year-over-year, the drop in occupancy drove 19.6 decline in Q1 RevPAR to $120. Las Vegas adjusted EBITDAR totaled $217 million, down 39.7% year-over-year or down 43% on a hold adjusted basis.Turning to the other U.S. segment Q1 net revenue totaled $874 million, down 13.5% year-over-year while adjusted EBITDAR decreased 50.2% to $116 million or down 51.3% on a hold normalized basis. Prior to the temporary network shutdown, we saw robust growth at our regional properties in the first two months of the quarter with net revenue up nearly 15% and adjusted EBITDAR increasing almost 40% year-over-year. Through February, we're experienced strong gaming revenue growth in Indiana and Iowa as capital projects came online, including our new sports books, the addition of table games at Harrah's Huser Park in Indiana Grand and our new Southern Indiana land based property, which opened in December.Our all other segment, which includes unallocated corporate expenses, CIE, managed properties and our international operations, net revenues totaled $132 million in Q1, down 12% year-over-year, primarily due to decreases in volumes at our international properties because of the closures. All other adjusted EBITDAR loss was $31 million flat year-over-year, primarily due to $13 million decrease at our high end international properties, offset by $12 million reduction in corporate expenses.In light of the property closures since March and our inability to predict when mandated shutdown periods may conclude or at the pace with which our business may recover after reopening, we've aggressively managed all of our operating levers to put us in the best position to reopen our properties at this appropriate time.First, we're conserving capital. In the first quarter, we spent $109 million our maintenance capital and $75 million in development capital, primarily related to the Caesars Forum project. As soon as declines in the business were evident, we stopped all capital that was not critical or contractually obligated. Second, we\u2019re reducing operating expenses and discretionary spending has been postponed indefinitely. These actions will significantly reduce our operating expenses going forward.Lastly, we're focused on preserving liquidity. To increase our cash position and enhance financial flexibility during the quarter, we fully drew down $1.14 billion under our revolving credit facilities. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and have no near-term debt maturities. I note that our liquidity needs to run the business at 100% demand is approximately $750 million.The combination of these efforts have enabled us to significantly reduce our daily cash requirements. As you can see on Slide 9, assuming we receive certain spend waivers which are in process, our daily cash burn is approximately $9.3 million, while our properties remain temporarily closed compared to our cash usage of approximately $17 million before the shutdown. We're taking this opportunity while properties are closed to evaluate cost centers to ensure prudent spending as properties come back online, and identify areas where we can permanently reduce expenses to help drive further profitability. While the actions we've taken are extremely difficult, we believe they're necessary for the long-term health of the company so that we can best position Caesars for strong and sustainable future.Before we open the call for questions, please note that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our first quarter performance. While we look forward to answering any questions you have about Caesars, for more information regarding the proposed merger with Eldorado, please refer to our filings with the SEC. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : Apologies for jumping back and forth quite a bit this afternoon with a few calls and issues going on. But I wanted to get a sense for work breakdown you can talk about between sort of thriving customers versus flying customers, and what insights you may be able to share about the strip to that end? Tony Rodio : I mean, I don't think that, I think we're all in pretty much in agreement that we think that the regional markets are going to bounce back quicker because of the lack of the need to fly it. It still remains to be seen from a Las Vegas perspective, but we are seeing some encouraging statistics and information as we look towards around the fourth quarter. When the governor are here in Las Vegas announced the move towards Phase 1 and the Raiders schedule came out, we actually had a pretty significant bump in renovations booked for the fourth quarter of this year, September through the fourth quarter of this year.Our group bookings in the fourth quarter are actually still ahead of last year's pace. Keep in mind we do have a Forum this year. Our regular bookings are off a little bit, but nothing for the fourth quarter, down a little less than 10%. So there are some encouraging signs. The other thing our player development folks and our hosts make outbound calls to our VIPs and our customers, and we're receiving a lot of encouraging feedback that customers are eager and excited to come back. David Katz : If I can just follow that up and maybe ask something a bit more pointed to you if there\u2019s info on it. Roughly statistically I think Las Vegas has about half and half driving versus flying in terms of visitation. My inclination is that you would be less than the average in terms of flying. But do you happen to track any of those statistics? Tony Rodio : I don\u2019t have that\u2026 Eric Hession : We're approximately 40% coming from Southern California of our hotel business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli. Carlo Santarelli : If referring to Slide 9 in the deck, as Eric mentioned earlier. Looks like you guys have basically, just from an operational perspective taken almost $7 million out on a daily basis. When you think about the business coming back online, it's kind of a two part question. A, what does it require in terms of revenues potentially split between the regionals in Vegas to get to EBITDAR neutral or flat EBITDAR? And secondly, with respect to the January and February period, could you guys maybe talk a little bit about what you did from a cost side perhaps that maybe wouuld drive some of the growth obviously acknowledged and there were summer events, and obviously, revenues were strong. But anything you guys implemented in that period that maybe speaks to this burn rate and how it's going to look going forward? Tony Rodio : Actually, let me take the second question first, because you're right, we were off to an incredible start in January and February. And I think it was the result of a number of initiatives. First and foremost, we have taken over $120 million worth of cost out the business on a annual run rate basis. And so the flow through on incremental revenues was much better flow through, that's number one. Number two, our international marketing team at Caesar's Palace had done a lot of work in the fourth quarter, couple trips to Asia that had teed this up for a great VVIP business in January in February of this year.Lastly, sports betting in our southern and across all of our regional markets drove a lot more foot traffic, which allowed us to grow revenues across all the verticals. And then lastly, the capital that we deployed to move to land in Southern Indiana and the opening of table games in both of the Indianapolis properties, both of those results exceeded our expectations through the first two months. So a combination of all those things allowed us to get off to a great start, and that\u2019s through the first two months, we were almost 30% up in EBITDA year-over-year, January and February '20, verses '19.Your second question in terms of the -- we've taken out, as you noted, roughly $8 million on an monthly cash burn basis. We certainly aren't putting that all back in at once. We're going to be bringing that back in a phased approach, but both by property and by marketing. And we're going to let the consumer and the customer dictate the volumes that are coming back, and that will determine how much of the cost that we bring back consistent with that. Eric Hession : Yes, the things that I would add Carlo. We believe that at the regional markets, we can be breakeven from a covering our variable costs between 15% and 20% of the volume previously, and then to cover the fixed costs of those properties is approximately 30%. It varies based on weather table games or slots only, and the various tax rates as you can understand that, that will give you some idea, which where we can breakeven and start generating cash at a relatively low level of volume.It's obviously a bit higher in Las Vegas, because of the more fixed nature of the business and the size of these operations. And that's more around the 50% area where we need to have 50% of our prior period revenues be able to breakeven from a fixed and variable cost perspective. We can breakeven from the variable cost perspective in Vegas at around 30% hotel occupancy or so. So again, the breakeven points are relatively low in the business, and we're optimistic that when we are allowed to reopen these facilities that we'll be able to quickly cover those and get everything open as fast as possible. Tony Rodio : The last thing I would notice, and I know it's a lifetime ago February, even though it's only a few months. Given how strong we were performing going into the closures, I'd like to think that that positions us well to perform as well as any of our competitors coming out of the closures. Carlo Santarelli : And I just wanted to make sure that I understood it probably. 30% was the total kind of volumes to be EBITDA flat, right relative to prior regionals and that same number was 50% in Las Vegas. Correct? Eric Hession : Yes, that's correct. Two breakeven on a EBITDA property level basic covering all the property, fixed costs and variable costs we'd need 30% regional and 50% Vegas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelly from Bank of America. Shaun Kelly : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about just mix in Las Vegas, I think there's also a coincidence release that came out today talking about the reopening, a potential staged reopening in a couple of your core markets. And was curious, could you talk a little bit about how much casino block business usually takes up of your overall profile? And how much you could potentially move that up to as you start to really work with your different, I think your different distribution engines, because I think that's a little bit unique to the to the Caesars story. So maybe some historical perspective of what you've done, or where you think you could take the casino block at a maximum basis at a property or two would be helpful to know? Eric Hession : I mean, typically our casino block represents about 40%. And I think one of the things that I feel good about is the casino marketing team has done a very good job of staying in touch with our VIP customers throughout the closure periods. I think marketing in general has done a lot of things that have kept them active. There's a lot of fun things that we've done on our caesars.com site that its kept them engaged, and the initiatives that we've taken to make sure and ensure their Caesars reward benefits are still there. So I\u2019d like to think that if the group and the travel businesses is going to be down coming right out of the closure, I think that we could probably perform a little bit better maybe go a little bit deeper and get a higher percentage than normal coming out of our casino block as we come out with a closure. Shaun Kelly : And then Tony, you have a lot of experience in Atlantic City, in particular. That market is a one that\u2019s a little bit unique to Caesars? Could you just give us a little bit of your perspective of how you think that markets going to perform on the back end of this? And to that end, any comments on, I think there were some proposals around potential phased in tax release in that market. How material or important could that be to Caesars? Tony Rodio : Well, it would be very important. And I know as we as an industry have put forth a lot of initiatives, I haven't seen or heard anything in terms of the regulators or the government responding to those as of yet. I think that Atlantic City is going to be similar to a lot of these regional markets. I think that there's going to be pent up demand, particularly in driving markets. And I think that you're going to see that rebound on a percentage basis better than Las Vegas. And we actually had begun to move the needle again the first couple of months of this year and started to see some positive traction in Atlantic City.I think the big question mark for Atlantic City is always the whole promotional environment, and how aggressive some of our competitors who are in difficult situations, that's I think the biggest question mark that I think about as we look to Atlantic City reopening. But I do think that Atlantic City like other regional markets will bounce back pretty quick. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Can you talk a little bit about how your online gambling business has been performing during this recent weeks and months? Tony Rodio : And I apologize, because I don't know the exact percentage and Eric, I don't know if you do. But in New Jersey, it's been up pretty significantly, almost -- I was going to say almost 100%. But obviously, it's a very small number relatively speaking but it is up dramatically and we recently launched in Pennsylvania as well. Eric Hession : Yes, we have a lot of activity in that space with the introduction potentially of live dealer very shortly, which we didn't have in New Jersey. We launched, as Tony mentioned, in Pennsylvania. And we'd anticipate rolling out in other states as soon as possible, particularly once sports come back online, getting mobile going in other locations as well. Tony Rodio : I was just going to say, you might see jurisdictions moving towards authorizing online gaming, I think as they're looking to close budget gaps and seeing how successful it's now becoming in some of the locations where it's been authorized. Thomas Allen : And then just as a follow up on this question. Any read into the demographics to the customers? Are they customers that used to be your brick and mortar customers and they've gone online, are they new customers and any read into how sticky that will be? Tony Rodio : Well, I can tell you before the closures, it was pretty much a totally different customer. It wasn't our bricks and mortar customer. And now it's -- I don't have the information on the last month or two since we've closed, there maybe a lot of brick and mortar customers that converted over to online for this period, where they can't come into the physical facility. But generally speaking, it was totally different younger demographic skewed more male, and it was a different customer than a bricks and mortar customer leading up to the closures. There was no cannibalization. As a matter of fact, we saw incremental play when you look at the two different populations, the people that were already bricks and mortar that played a little bit online and people that weren't bricks and mortar that became online customers and then periodically would visit the facilities. Thomas Allen : And just in terms of the reopenings, and thanks for laying out which markets you're going to phase in. I think there's a wide range of expectations of when biggest properties are going to reopen from like Memorial Day. And then some expectations that the companies have phase in openings may not open certain properties until 2022. Any sense of your opinions on how that's going to shake out? Tony Rodio : Well, first of all, I support the governor and the approach that he's taken, and I think that he's done a fantastic job and he's obviously in a very difficult spot. But I agree and support the way he's approaching this. The fact that he decided to open the Phase 1 businesses, which is before casinos, it\u2019s local restaurants and its beauty salons and retail. I personally didn't expect that to happen till later in the month. And so for that to have happened this past Saturday and there was a ton of pent up demand in local restaurants, I don\u2019t know what that will mean or translate to the strip, but that happened sooner than we thought.If all goes well knock wood, phase ones could be about two weeks phase. If there's not a spike, we could be looking at casino opening, strip openings later this month. There's no guarantee, he's not committed to that. But again, I agree with the way he's approaching it. When we do see the openings in Vegas, we're going to look at it in a phased approach as we mentioned. Certainly, Caesars Palace will be one of the properties that we would open first. We\u2019d probably open a value oriented property on the east side of the strip. And it may be three, four properties depending upon consumer demand. So that part remains to be seen. And then we will be able to quickly ramp up as demand dictates. Eric Hession : And I\u2019d just add to that, that in the regional markets, it does appear that they're moving a bit faster in terms of reopening. We have currently as its contemplated, we'll have our auction facility in Arizona opening on the 15th. The two Cherokee properties in North Carolina will open on the following Monday. And then we also understand that Louisiana casinos will be able to open as well this weekend. So that's good news. And we'll get some early read in terms of the demand from the customers in terms of how the demand comes into those casinos when they reopen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Harry Curtis from Instinet. Your line is open. Harry Curtis : Tony, quick question on the comment about Louisiana, just as an example of the reopening of other casinos. To what degree do you think it's an opportunity to prioritize your highest value customers, because if you take a look at the pent up demand in at hospitality or entertainment that has come online so far, there seems to be a very strong surge in demand, which is a great problem to have. So if you have this demand, how can you maximize your win per position or do you plan to, or is it going to be just first come first serve? Tony Rodio : Certainly from a hotel perspective, I think this company has done a fantastic job of yielding to the highest worth customer, whether it's cash paying customer whether it's a deserving casino customer. So in terms of who stays in hotel that part's easy. And given that we're going to be yielding the hotel towards the highest worth customers, we maybe in some jurisdiction require to limit the number of people coming into the property. The people that will have the first priority will be those that are in the hotel. And just by virtue of the yielding, they're going to be the highest worth customers. In terms of the additional fill that will be allowed to let in that probably will be on a first come first serve basis. I don't see how we'd be able to yield, say we're allowed to have 50% capacity. And I don't know if the hotel customers are taking off some percentage, I don't know how we'd be able to yield that additional capacity but certainly the hotel. Eric Hession : One thing we are doing, Harry, is that we're making our marketing efforts a whole lot more variable. And then we'll be able to flex those according to the demand. So if we do see the fortunate situation that you described where we have lots of demand, we can quickly back off on the marketing to certain subsets of our database and make sure that simply by providing the incentives to those customers that are much more highly valuable in terms of profitability then they would have a higher incentive to come to the property than others.We've also talked about doing it based on time. So in other words, you could have a multiplier that's valid during certain time periods of the day, because as you know from following the industry for a long time, even if we only have 50% of our slot machines open, there are only certain periods of the week when you really need all 50% -- when you need all of your slot machines open. So a midweek period mid day, that would be a good time to try to incent a lot of customers to come in, because we will likely not be at capacity during those periods of time. Harry Curtis : So do you care to answer this question of whether or not given a limited supply of gaming positions you plan on tightening machines a bit? Tony Rodio : I think that's more of a competitive question and I'd rather not discuss on the call. Harry Curtis : I thought I\u2019d just take a shot. And then just a quick question for Eric. Can you just walk through the burn per day, the cash burn per day figure? Again, because I think it was, you said it was pretty much fully loaded. And I'm assuming kind of normalized conditions. And can you take a crack at what\u2019s come down to for example, the last if you want to take the last week, for example? Eric Hession : Yes, if you refer to Slide 9, you can see where our breakdown is. We tried to call out the major items like the rent to Vici $2.2 million and the debt service at $1.7 million, those are very easy to calculate based on prior disclosure. Our capital expense reductions, as I noted, we carry over significant amount of capital into this year due to mainly the conference center and then the boat to land project. So our Q1 capital was fairly high. We've since put nearly all of our capital projects on hold. We're continuing those for safety and critical nature, as well as those that were almost done, we're finishing them out. But the daily cash spend on that is much lower. Now you can see it's about a million dollars.And then from the operational perspective, that's mainly salaries and wages. So we furloughed 93% of our employees. We have hopefully plans to bring the vast majority of those back. But as Tony mentioned earlier, we're not going to bring back employees at all at once, and we'll try to bring them back at a pace that\u2019s slower than the ramp up in the revenue, so that we get the flow through and get to breakeven as quickly as possible. So those are really kind of the four key categories. And the one that we have the most control over that has the most significant is that labor component, and we're going to be acutely focused to make sure we bring it back at the right pace for the business to get back to cash flow neutral as quickly as possible. Operator : I would like to turn the call over to our presenters. Please continue. Tony Rodio : Thank you very much. It doesn\u2019t look like we have any other questions. We appreciate everybody's time, and stay well and stay healthy. Operator : And thank you again for joining us today. This conclude today\u2019s conference and you can now disconnect.",

Please note that all lines have been on mute to prevent any background noise, and the today's webcast is being recorded. After the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Brian Agnew, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Brian Agnew : Thank you, Michelle, and good afternoon to everyone, on the call. And welcome to the first earnings call for the new Caesars Entertainment to discuss our second quarter 2020 earnings. This afternoon we issued a press release announcing our second quarter financial results for the period ended June 30, 2020. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore one should not place undue reliance on them. Forward looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward looking statements you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release, as well as the risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's call. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com, by selecting the press release regarding the company's 2020 second quarter financial results. And finally, while our press release today and our 10-Q cover the operations of legacy Eldorado for the second quarter of 2020, the company posted supplemental financial information for the combined new Caesars to our website this afternoon, covering the period January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, which we will discuss today on the call. I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us. We're in a totally different world than the last time we spoke to you on an earnings call. At that point, not every casino in the country on both sides was closed. The Caesars deal had not -- the Caesars transaction had not closed. And I was sitting in a car in a parking lot of a grocery store addressing you, so that I had a cell signal. So we've come a long way since then. I want to thank the Caesars management team and the ERI team for the extraordinary effort to get 50 plus properties reopen, as the world reopened in the May, June timeframe. I want to thank most of all our frontline employees that are dealing with customers every day. As everyone knows, this is an uncertain situation that we're dealing with. There are scary reports out there. Our employees came back at better than a 95% clip in terms of being called back to work. We've got about 55% of them back. We're very happy that that's the case. And we're thankful for the work that they have put in to make our reopening as successful as it's been. On our last call, I talked to you about things that I saw in seamless reports and in the Investor community that I thought were in error, most notably pointed to you should expect to see a significant margin surprise on the regional side. I think you've seen that across the sector. I think there's some misconceptions still around, particularly the regional business that I'll address, as we get to that point of the call. In terms of results, as Brian told you, this is an odd quarter for us. In that we file financial adjust for the Eldorado side. So we took the step of this supplemental filing that gives you pro forma historical results in the same layout that we intend to report on going forward, so you should be able to build into your models as seamlessly as you can in something that's big in terms of transaction. For the quarter on a consolidated basis, we're just shy of $500 million of revenue. We lost $136 million on the EBITDA line. Obviously, that was due to most of the portfolio being closed for the first two months of the year. You already saw our reopening results when we did our financing in June, -- I'm sorry, in July so you know that regionals were quite strong. Destination markets have lagged. And Anthony will get into specifics of the numbers there, but that would be -- our experience has been the same going into this quarter. You had some -- what I would describe as media fear monitoring over what might happen. 4th of July, weekend that I think muted visitation across the country. But other than that weekend, our results across the board have been similar to what we reported in the reopening period. As discussed, we closed the Caesars transaction on July 20. Prior to that, we did some significant capital raising both debt and equity. And Brett will take you through specifics of that. Turning to our operating segments, in Las Vegas, we are running and have been running midweek occupancy around 50%, and starting to climb again. We're running weekend occupancy to our caps which are now in the high 70s. We've kept occupancy in Las Vegas, because of limitations on what the customers can be offered in the non-gaming area, in food and beverage limitations, no bars most recently, and social distancing at pools when it's 110 degrees. We want to keep control of the health and safety situation for both customers and employees. So Caesars was capping occupancy as properties reopened at 80%, and was running that on weekends. They pulled back to 70% as cases rose in Nevada, and we started to move that back up since we took over. We're pushing -- almost 60% of our rooms are casino rooms. So effectively, our prior casino block and what used to represent convention business of 14%, 15%, as combined into one casino room block. That's very different than our peers in Las Vegas, as I'm sure you're aware, as you listen to these comments. We are putting customers into rooms where we're supremely confident as to how much revenue we're going to get from that room during the visit. We're far less dependent on the random guy who books through FTA, and you really don't know what you're going to get. It had shown us and should show you the power of Caesars, or that's clearly a very different mix and occupancy level than our competition here. And keep in mind that those numbers are prior to the Eldorado customers coming into the Caesars database. So we think that's going to continue to get better. As you look at Vegas going forward, what I think you should consider the following; One, the numbers relative to the virus have been gradually improving from spike a few weeks ago. Unless you presume that that's going to reverse and we're going to go in the wrong direction, we and all of our peers in Las Vegas should be doing as usual as we're going to do right now. And I just told you, the levels that we're doing. We are significantly EBITDA positive in Las Vegas. Every property that is open, every hotel that's open is EBITDA positive. And we feel we're going to build from there. If you think about a stable virus situation or improving virus situation, the next steps in Las Vegas would be bars would come back, which we think is a reasonable possibility, relatively soon. And then you'd be looking at socially distance entertainment as a possibility. We're unique in our mix of entertainment in that. We are not as dependent on headliners and cliques as the rest of the market. We have a lot of shows that are smaller venues, multiple times a day and would be profitable at typical social distance guidelines. So as those come online, we should have a mix of entertainment that isn't matched in the market just because of the structure of how us and our peers have tackled entertainment historically. And then the big piece is the group business. So group business, we had a very strong quarter of booking new group business. Group business, as you book it in a quarter, is typically for six to 24 months out, and our booking levels were dramatically in excess of last year. But what's happening in the meantime is existing group business in the near-term is canceling. We've got a prohibition on groups north of 50 in Nevada, Las Vegas in particular. Until those caps are lifted, I don't think you're going to see group business return. And those groups, well, I know that group business will return. And particularly your larger groups, those require a lot of forward planning. So it's not surprising to us that you start to see first quarter conferences start to cancel, when the 50 person cap is still in place. As you start to see bars reopen, you start to see socially distance entertainment, and ultimately you see groups more than 50. And importantly, we get out of the pool season, where there is such heavy demand for that product. We would expect to lift our caps and we would expect to fill to those caps in Las Vegas. So we're extremely pleased with the way that Las Vegas reopens. Gary Selesner leads our team out here as Regional President. And he and all of the GMs and leaders in the Las Vegas market did a fantastic job, under incredibly trying circumstances to get us off and running, and we're excited for where we'll go from here. On the regional side, we are seeing continued strength. We have drags in Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans where we're generating positive EBITDA, but at levels that are comparable to the declines that we've seen in Las Vegas, in terms of year-over-year numbers, basically because those customers come from beyond an hour to drive. And in Reno, for example, we've only got about half of our rooms open. Atlantic City, you can't serve food in restaurants, you can't serve alcohol. You've got 25% access to your casino floor. So, you have structural limitations that are drags on those properties results. But even with that, in the regional space, we are approaching prior year levels in EBITDA. We're still not quite there, but we're getting pretty close. So, the regional markets continue to improve. And in terms of what I'm seeing and narrative that I disagree with, we've seen tremendous margin improvement, as we detailed and Anthony will go into detail in his remarks. We expect that to continue. It's not going to continue 100% because you are going to bring in pieces of the business like lower limit table games, that will be profitable, but are diluted to that margin number as you move forward and are able to do that. But I think the fear of return of promotional spending in the regional space is completely off the mark. We for a very long time have looked at or have been talked to you about that these subsidies in the business were unnecessarily. All of us, everybody in the sector has gotten a look now, as to what their business looks like without those subsidies. And it's impossible to argue with the results that we're seeing. I just saw a Penn this morning, super strong quarter and just the latest in a line of them. You should not expect people running back to promotions that are dilutive to EBITDA. So, on the one hand if you believe that you believe the people that run the businesses in this sector are morons, because they can see what the business looks like without them. But two, the actives that you would have been worried about in the past in that area, have largely been absorbed by companies like us and Penn and Boyd and others. And those that are left that could behave in that fashion, don't have enough scale to where somebody like us would need to react to it. So, I think I read a lot about your fears or here questions on fear of promotional return. I think you guys are way off base. The other point I think is off is the fear that this level of business is unsustainable. It is undoubtedly true that we have benefited from customers that have no other entertainment, or little in the way of other entertainment options coming to visit our properties over since reopening. As those other options movie theaters, cruise lines, sporting events, as those come online, you have more options. Some of those will go away. Some of them will keep. But our softest segment is 55 plus, which coincides with our most, if not our most valuable among our most valuable segments. And those are generally people that are fearful of leaving their house at this point. So, logically, we're seeing some softness there, despite that we're putting up the numbers that we're putting up. And I don't see a scenario where those other entertainment options are opening, so we're losing some of that new business. And the health situation hasn't improved to the point where that 55 plus group is coming back. So, I think you're also off base there. Our unrated businesses up substantially since reopening, and really has replaced the lag and 55 plus, like I said, I think we're going to keep some of that unrated business and I think the 55 plus will come back. So I think regional is very strong now and going to get stronger. And then I would conclude my opening remarks with sports and online is a hot topic of conversation these days, with anybody I talk to on the phone. I'll tell you again, we want to come to a permanent solution for this business for us. We bring the William Hill partnership. We bring our internet gaming business, Caesars brings its own internet gaming business and its sports business and its sports partnerships. And we see the same valuations that you see in this space as we sit here today. But I will tell you, as shareholders, we're not going to react in a knee jerk fashion to those valuations, and do something that's not the right solution for the business over the long haul. So we're going to prosecute that opportunity. I would still expect that we'll have something comprehensive to talk to you about inside of this calendar year, but you shouldn't expect this to be printing something right around the corner. And just to give you an idea of what this business looks like, if you look at the combination of what we bring into the William Hill partnership, we believe that next year we're in the range of $600 million to $700 million of revenue in this area, which, as you know, is similar to others out there. The difference is we're making money. So, if you look at just 2020 iGaming revenues, which we own 100% of, we're pacing to $125 million of revenue in just New Jersey, and margins are mid to high 30s on that business. So we think we have an extraordinary opportunity there. And I'll say it again, there is room for multiple success stories in this space. This is the most exciting growth opportunity that I've seen in over 25 years in and around this space. There's going to be multiple players that succeed. I'm 100% convinced we're going to be one. And with that, I'm going to turn it to Anthony to go into our operating detail. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon to everyone, on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for the combined new Caesars reopened properties during the second quarter. Our first regional property began reopening on May 18. And week by week, we were able to continue reopening additional properties throughout the quarter. As of today, 51 of our 54 owned, leased and managed properties in the U.S. have reopened. All of our regional properties have successfully reopened, and six of our nine assets in Las Vegas have reopened. Currently reopening of Hollywood and Cromwell remain closed. As disclosed in our 8-K from July 15, the Caesar's legacy original properties that reopened during the second quarter reported strong operating results. Through June 30, these properties achieved revenue growth of 9% to 11% year-over-year, and EBITDA growth of 70% to 80%. Margins for the reopened regional properties increased approximately 1,800 basis points. Additionally, the reopened legacy Caesar\u2019s, defamation properties reported revenue declines of 40% to 50%, and EBITDA declines of 55% to 60%, both on a hold adjusted basis. Margins for legacy Caesar\u2019s defamation property decreased approximately 1,500 basis points. On the legacy Eldorado side, revenues for the reopened regional properties decreased approximately 9%, EBITDA increased 16%, and margins expanded by 920 basis points year-over-year. Legacy Eldorado destination properties that reopened during Q2 generated revenue declines of 42%, and EBITDA declines of 29%. Margins expanded by 540 basis points. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses at our reopened properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. I'm extremely proud of our team members and their commitment to deliver great guest experiences in these very difficult times. All of our team members have contributed to our ability to successfully reopen our properties and to deliver these strong operational results. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brett for some additional insights on the second quarter, and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Brett? Bret Yunker : Thanks, Anthony. As everyone on this call is aware, we had a very active second quarter from a financial perspective, which was highlighted by our historic debt and equity executions that were successfully placed in late June, and yielded at $8.8 billion of proceeds to finalize the merger financing. In conjunction with our capital markets execution, we also announced $700 million of incremental liquidity through transactions with Vici and our banks that we expect to be effective by the end of September. The driving logic behind our capital raises was to put an abundance of liquidity on the balance sheet, that will allow us to navigate through various operating scenarios that we understand will evolve alongside the ongoing health crisis. Pro forma for the full redemption of the Caesars convertible notes and closing of the aforementioned transactions will have access to $2.2 billion of undrawn revolving credit facilities, just under $1 billion of operating cash, and approximately $600 million of excess cash on the balance sheet. Based on current operating trends, and the execution of incremental cost savings, we expect to end the year with the bulk of that excess cash on hand, and zero balance on the revolvers. Given the number of properties in our system and short booking windows being experienced in our destination markets, this is the most dynamic modeling scenario we've ever encountered. What we know sitting here today is that our regional portfolio, in large part is performing admirably on a year-over-year basis. The strip will remain challenged until we see a meaningful return of group business and other non-gaming forms of entertainment. And we will continue to execute on our original plan to drive merger-related revenue and expense synergies. Our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. We're learning more every day about the Caesars portfolio and are excited by many of the investment opportunities being brought to us by both our corporate and property level leadership teams, and the potential for cash flow savings in areas where capital resources had been previously misdirected. In terms of modeling over the next 12 months, we expect to spend approximately $350 million on CapEx, excluding any Atlantic City CapEx that was escrowed when we closed the merger. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Brett. With that we'll open it up to questions from the group. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you. Hey, thanks, everybody, for taking my question. Thanks for your comments. Tom, you spoke a little bit about the 2Q group booking pace for Las Vegas. And I just wanted to confirm because I wasn't entirely clear, when you talk about the group productivity over the next six to 18 months that you experienced in 2Q. Is that -- I don't want to say organic but unique to stuff that what -- you're not talking about stuff that might have been canceled earlier and was rebooked. Those are kind of incremental things. Or it wasn't stuff that was canceled in the near-term and pushed out to 2021 or 2022, or whatever it was, is that correct? Tom Reeg : Yes. So, to give you Carlo specifics, we booked almost $200 million worth of business versus $120 million in last year's quarter. About 15% of that business was rebooked. So, 85% is new business. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. That\u2019s very specific. Thanks. I appreciate it. Just in terms of, how you guys are thinking about I know obviously there's a couple divestitures here that are already ticketed and targeted. There's a couple that you'll work through. And then there's, the Las Vegas strip asset. Just in terms of the cadence of those as you move forward, what are you kind of thinking in terms of timelines for some of the Indiana stuff, as well as any debate actually happened in Las Vegas? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Carlo, we had some smaller properties that had processes ongoing before and through the merger process. So to the extent that any of that resolves itself, soon you could see some activity there, but that would be largely immaterial to the size of the business. If you look at what's coming. Obviously, we have divestiture trip requirements coming out of Indiana, that have a relatively near-term timeline associated with them. You should expect that we are working on those and we'll be looking to get something done relatively quickly. In Las Vegas, we still intend to sell a Las Vegas asset. I would say, pre-COVID we were talking about a deal within the first 12 months post-closing. It's possible that now that's first 12 to 18 months. But as soon as you get to the other side of the virus and more normalized business levels, you should expect we'll be thinking about that as well. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And then Bret excuse me, if this is maybe -- I saw that the Q was just filed, but I don't believe that there's anything in there as it pertains to the pro forma entity. Any chance you could provide cash and debt for the combined company as of June 30 potentially? Bret Yunker : Yes. The round numbers are about $14.7 billion of traditional debt, and roughly $1.7 billion-ish of total cash. So $13 billion of net debt, which if you look back to last year's merger announcement deck, you would have landed at $13.5 and $1 billion so $12.5 billion. The difference is really the taking fees and some of the extra cash for CapEx. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thanks very much, guys. Bret Yunker : Yes. Thanks, Carlo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from the company of Stifel. Your line is now open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Tom, I guess given everything you've gone through the last couple months, I think, you might, maybe I'm crazy, but it to me almost sound more optimistic than ever on the long-term health of the regional. And I'd even say maybe strip gaming markets. With all the costs that you have taken out of the business, I guess how do you, maybe envision EBITDA flow through? What is that going to look like a couple years down the road? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Steve, as you know, normally we've been telling you, here's what the synergies realized were the first day, here's where we are versus our target, that's been flipped on its ear. You got about a little over $1 billion a quarter of cost that is not back in the business. And at closing, Caesars had executed on about $200 million of the original $400 million of cost saving. So, to hit our $800 million target, the $400 million original and the $400 million we announced in the financing, about half of that would stay offline. That certainly seems eminently achievable. And that would put our margins in the mid-30s versus a 28% number, if you use the same revenue number as 2019. But obviously, at a lower revenue number, that margin is going to be higher. I think that as you look out past what's going on with the virus and getting into a normal environment, I think you should be thinking about this consolidated business as at least high-30s of EBITDA margin if not four handle. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. That's very, very helpful. I guess the second question would be, you talked about the sports betting opportunity. And I think you said $600 million to $700 million in revenues. I don't know, if that was, I think you said next year. But can you maybe help us break that down a little bit in terms of how you're getting to that range? Tom Reeg : That's what we're bringing to the party, and what William Hill U.S. does combined. So we've got an ownership piece in William Hill U.S., which is predominantly our piece of the partnership that they have with us. Plus our iGaming stuff that's outside of that partnership. We think total revenue will be $600 million to $700 million next year. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, got you. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? Tom Reeg : Yes, now you are good. Thomas Allen : All right. Just staying with sports bank, can you just talk about what you see in the sports books and the Major Leagues re-launched? Tom Reeg : You see, anecdotally, I tell you, you see significant activity because there's really not a lot else that's open. Right now, if you're in Vegas, you're at a gaming table and you are you're at a pool or you're in your room, and now you've got sports books as well you're seeing more than normal levels of activity live in the regional sports books. Thomas Allen : Okay, perfect. And then thinking longer-term in New Jersey I think you have a little bit over 20% market share in iGaming and decent share in sports betting. Can you just talk a little bit about the cross sell between those products that you're planning on doing? Tom Reeg : Yes, clearly that's going to be key, a single wallet solution, particularly one that is tied to our rewards database. And what we can offer we think is going to be powerful. And as I said, we're already significantly EBITDA positive in that business. So, we don't have the same customer acquisition costs as others that we're competing with, nor do we have the access fees as well. So, that's why we think we can be so well positioned in this space. But as I said, I expect multiple winners here. Thomas Allen : My last question is, can you give us July EBITDAR for those combined companies. Tom Reeg : No. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Dan Politzer : Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. You've had a lot of assets and there's still more planned. I guess, how should we think about the free cash flow algorithm that maybe laid out? When you first announced the deal the $1.5 billion, and I asked that, acknowledging that it's a much different operating environment. But assuming things do normalize at some point, what does that look like? Tom Reeg : We laid out a -- we thought there was a path to $10 of free cash flow per share when we announced the transaction, we still think there's a path to $10 a free cash flow per share. Dan Politzer : Does that assume a recovery of the strip in full? Or is it above prior in that scenario? Tom Reeg : From a revenue standpoint, it's a recovery to something resembling 2019. But we're not presuming a peak beyond that. Dan Politzer : All right, thanks. And then on sports betting in iGaming. Can you maybe talk about how you think about growing your share there? And we've looked at we've seen the numbers in New Jersey, we've also seen the numbers in Pennsylvania. I guess, what are the differences in what's going on in those states? Is this just a matter of Caesars, hadn't really ramped its product there? Or is this something that you guys are looking to grow share in the near future? Tom Reeg : It's a function of the former, that Caesars has not ramped its product in Pennsylvania and it has in New Jersey. Dan Politzer : And then how do you think about your long-term share in sports betting in an iGaming any opportunity? Tom Reeg : Look, you know that we're going to -- we're not going to be the guy that's out there buying share. We think the combination of all of the assets that we can bring to bear there and may rewards database should put us among the leaders in the space. And, I think that leaders in the space are going to be call it somewhere between 15% and 30% market share. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much and congrats on closing that decision. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Decree of Union Gaming. Your line is now open. John Decree : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and second congratulations on getting the transaction over the finish line. Tom, I wanted to ask about the casino mix in Las Vegas. I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned 60% or so right now. Curious if you could put a little context around that as to what former Caesars kind of casino mix in Las Vegas had been? And where do you think the optimal mix is going forward in Las Vegas as things hopefully begin to normalize? Tom Reeg : We were at -- prior Caesars was at 40% and about 15% of group business. We'd sure like to have that group business back. But as I said, that's going to take a little bit of time. Bringing the Eldorado -- the piece that you want to take from, is the OTA piece, just there's nothing wrong with OTAs it's just that customer is the least predictable in terms of what they spend outside the room. And so to the extent that we can, by bringing our customers into the Caesars database, increasing the opportunity set by 20%, we can claw some more share in casino play at the expense of OTA. That's a good trade for us. Casino segment for group segment is not as good of a trade, but it's far better than replacing group business with either an empty room or OTA customer. John Decree : Got it, that's helpful. And the last one, as a quick follow-up on Las Vegas. The properties that have not yet reopened. You've mentioned you're kind of seeing a little bit of occupancy build and some restrictions are lifted. You could build occupancy at the open properties. How do you think about the reopening of what's left general guidelines? Obviously tough to predict how things will play out over the next couple of weeks, but what should we look for as you contemplate reopening additional rooms and additional properties? Tom Reeg : Well, we look at Las Vegas as the city. So if we can open a property and it's additive to incremental EBITDA citywide, that's when we'll pull the trigger. John Decree : Great. Thank you, and thanks for the FD filing with the pro forma, that's very helpful. Tom Reeg : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas, SunTrust. Your line is now open. Barry Jonas : Thank you. Tom, how important is having an omni channel strategy when you think about digital? And are there any limits to executing on that strategy if your land based and digital businesses would somehow be separate entities? Tom Reeg : Well, as I said in answer to Thomas's question, you want a single wallet strategy that's integrated into your player data base and takes advantage of all the offerings that we have on the physical side. So you shouldn't expect us to do a deal that gets in the way of that outcome. Barry Jonas : Got it. And then maybe I missed this as well, but after Indiana and potentially one asset in Vegas, are you thinking about any more divestitures or potentially there are any holes that you'd like to fill in any markets? Tom Reeg : Everything's for sale every day, Barry. We\u2019re entirely economic animals. In terms of what we are looking at the divestitures that you listed are what we\u2019re considering. But we\u2019re always happy to be wowed by for one of our assets. In terms of holes in the system, I really don't look at the map and say, I've got to figure out a way to be in some particular city. And you shouldn't expect us to be doing anything on the international front anytime soon. Barry Jonas : Got it. And just if I can have one more. We heard a little bit today about cashless technologies and potentially, their introduction. Any thoughts there about introducing that to your properties and potentially how meaningful that could be? Tom Reeg : I think it's long overdue in the space. I think this entire public health situation has been awful across the board. That's among the handfuls of silver linings that the handling of cash in this business is antiquated. Most of the rest of the world is now moving to cashless are already there. And I think that because of what's happened with the virus, I would expect the pace of the ability to get there to quicken. And that's a big cost savings for us. That's additional liquidity. It's a whole. It hits a lot of different areas that you might not be thinking of as you think of that transition. That would be a big win for the entire space. Barry Jonas : Great. I really appreciate the commentary. Thanks, guys. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Barry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the acquisition. Tom, you answered the synergy question already. But I wanted to ask it in a slightly different way. I guess the way that, we have been thinking about it before, just thinking about the original buckets. So, I think you've noted that labor I guess in totality is around 3 billion on an annual basis. And you mentioned that now you're back to roughly 55%. So, when the Rio, Planet Hollywood, Cromwell are open, I guess where does this put you? And then more importantly, realistically, where do you think this number gets to in the next, six to 12 months on a percentage basis? Thanks. Tom Reeg : So, I'd say we're at 55% in terms of volumes bodies. In terms of expenses that have come back, we'd be higher than that. Most of what is furloughed our frontline employees it is in terms of absolute volumes. So, there's more cost that has come back than the 55%. But that's where you think about areas that are likely gone forever. Like I'm amused to hear the rest of the space now talk about the phase like I've been talking about them with you for four or five years, Chad, where I don't really understand why we would lose as much money as we did in that business historically. Well, now, everybody seems to have come to that conclusion. And from a health and safety standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter whether we came to that conclusion or not, you can't open. So, areas like that you're going to see significant costs not come back. We raised our synergy estimate by $400 million post-COVID. And significant piece of that is areas like that, that don't come back and then marketing that doesn't come back, where as I said, everybody in the space has gotten kind of the answer key to the test. And I don't expect a lot of that to come back. Chad Beynon : Great, thanks. Yes, you're definitely a trendsetter. And then regarding the William Hill relationship, I believe they've moved pretty fast on the strip from a retail standpoint. I think their books are now live at Paris Link and maybe even Caesars Palace. But on the online branding side, should we still expect that they'll be running with Caesars sports and William Hill as the brands to customers online? And is there anything with the CBS partnership that customers will be able to see in the near-term now that sports are open? Tom Reeg : Well the CBS partnership really from a business standpoint it's access to a database that should drive business. From a rollout the standpoint our books here are what is it William Hill at Caesars in terms of what the brand is online two brands, William Hill and Caesars. Chad Beynon : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi. Afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. You've covered a lot as usual. Bret, I hope you don't mind me asking you to just repeat the very last sentence of the remark around CapEx for the next 12 months and help us with some cadence in any color you might be able to give us beyond that, just since we're modeling a bit longer than that? It would help. Thanks. Bret Yunker : Yes. No problem, David. I spoke about $350 million looking out over the next 12 months of CapEx across the portfolio, excluding Atlantic City specific CapEx which we asked growth for the day we closed the merger. David Katz : And so the $350 million, is that in inclusive of maintenance and growth? Or is that the total net? Bret Yunker : That's both. David Katz : Got it. Because I can recall, talking about numbers that were a little higher, obviously pre-pandemic that may have started with a six. Are you deferring some of that or am I mixing an apple in an orange? Bret Yunker : A little bit of both. We've got a compression of the portfolio obviously with a number of divestitures. So the size of the portfolio comes down. So this is the cadence of CapEx. There's a little bit of remaining room remodel CapEx in Las Vegas that was traditionally in that run rate number, that you would see by Caesars historically. So we've got a little bit of both. We expect that as everything comes back online, some of the lower returning capital projects will get turned on if you get past this next 12 months. Tom Reeg : And I'd add, David that $300 million doesn't include the capital that will be spent in Atlantic City, because for our purposes, the $400 million is already in escrow, it's already been spent. David Katz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelly of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelly : Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Just really one question or kind of clarification, because you already spoken about that. But I'm just interested in the casino mix with the 60% number that you spoke of in the prepared remarks. Just curious, how is that trended as it kind of reintroduced or open new properties? Does that number stay pretty stable for you? And is that an optimal number? When you kind of think about going forward, if you get the group mix back, do you want to keep that casino mix high? Or are you actually more profitable if you mix into more kind of, let's call it traditional hotel and leisure guests, but this is who is available right now? Tom Reeg : So, like I said, you want the group business back, you'd like and expect that to grow as the forum comes online, with groups coming back. So that would eat into or that would grow higher. The casino mix, we expected it to go higher post transaction, because we're introducing the Eldorado player data basin, but that would have been at the expense of OTA. And in terms of experience at properties as we have reopened, it's been pretty steady throughout, it's been very heavy casino mix, which again speaks to the power of that database. Shaun Kelly : And Tom just to clarify. If you haven't yet -- I mean are you at the place yet where you have introduced facility to the Eldorado database? I mean I would assume with the how quickly the mergers close you haven't even gotten to that point yet? Tom Reeg : So day one, we were able to link your account. If you are, whether you were on the Eldorado side or the Caesar side, similar to when two airlines merges and you have both frequent flyer programs. So you can effectively transfer your status, it's a bit clunky. By the middle of September, it will have rolled out on a not fully functional but functional enough for most of the customer base throughout the Eldorado portfolio. And then there's another level of fully integrated like it was a Caesars property all along. That starts in December, and that'll probably take another six months or so to roll through the entire portfolio. So that's the mechanics. But in terms of impact on the business until you get to mid-September, and you rolled it out across the ERI system, you have the people that are really paying attention that are taking advantage now. It should be a step function in the middle of September. Shaun Kelly : Thank you very much. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in here and taking my question. Tom, if I could just go back to your comments on sports and iGaming. You said you'll have something comprehensive to talk about inside of this calendar year. Are you specifically referring to a separation or is it maybe a restructured agreement with William Hill? Can you just help me understand that comment. And then if you were to separate this business, would you still want to have majority ownership? Tom Reeg : The answer to what happened before yearend is a comprehensive strategy that describes how we are going to prosecute the sports opportunity that could include any number of what you laid out or more. We are looking for the greatest return for our shareholders. I'm not trying to solve for how much of an entity I need to own. But I'd also say, as I said in my opening remarks, this is the biggest growth opportunity I've seen in this space since riverboats were being legalized in the early 90s, that we want to own a lot. So, we're looking for what's the best path operationally, just in terms of running the business and we've had some questions we dealt with that and then what makes the best sense for our shareholders. And the marriage of that will produce what we're hoping to be able to announce by the end of the year. Jared Shojaian : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just as an unrelated follow-up going back to Vegas. I appreciate all the commentary pretty impressive, just given the circumstance. But can you give us a sense for what the Vegas strip did in the month of June on revenue and EBITDA? And I know in your July update, you gave us the destination properties. But I'm not sure if that's fair to extrapolate to the Vegas strip just given you periodically reopening properties throughout the month. And then whatever that number is for June, is it fair to extrapolate that out to July and what you're seeing so far to-date? Tom Reeg : So Vegas added about $100 million of revenue in June, and about $25 million of EBITDA. And in terms of July, we would have been softer than that pace for the first week and pretty much back at that pace after that. Jared Shojaian : All right, that's very helpful. Thank you very much. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Jared. Operator : There's no questions at the moment. Please continue? Tom Reeg : Well, thanks everyone for your time. And we look forward to\u2026 Operator : We hope you found this webcast presentation informative. This concludes your webcasts and you may now disconnect. Bret Yunker : Thanks very much.",

I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks Brian. Good afternoon everybody. We're back to report our third quarter earnings. As you look at our income statement, keep in mind that Eldorado Resorts was the surviving entity in the transaction. We changed our name to Caesars Entertainment. So, there's a lot of noise in the financial statements you're looking at 2019 numbers that are legacy Eldorado. You're looking at 2020 numbers that are legacy Eldorado only through July 20th, and then the combined company through the end of the quarter. We're going to cut through and get you to what we think are the key points in the quarter. Our same-store adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was a little over $460 million which was a little ahead of the wide end of the range of our pre-release during our equity offering. We're quite pleased with the progress that we've made since closing the transaction. We've seen quite a bit of opportunity within Caesars. Some was expected some were nice surprises. We continue to believe that we will bring the consolidated EBITDA margin in a post-COVID world at least to the mid to high 30s if not 40% EBITDA margin in the consolidated entity. Vegas, Anthony will get into detail, but we did $60 million of EBITDA in Vegas and keep in mind that was with dragging Rio and Cromwell and Planet Hollywood were closed for the whole quarter. Planet Hollywood and Rio have opened since valleys was also closed for part of the quarter. So, we are carrying operating losses relative to those assets to get to that $60 million number. Our occupancy for the quarter in Las Vegas was just under 60% just few basis points under 60%. We're running in the mid-50s on weekdays now and weekends were well into the mid to high 90s. So, we've been heartened by our performance. Clearly, that's a key piece of evidence on the strength of the Caesars Rewards program, Pavan Kapoor Caesars who we inherited on the yield management side is a wizard with this stuff and has done a tremendous job for us in Vegas and we've moved him throughout the company in this area. So, we're excited with what Pavan and his group will bring to the table for us. As I said the merger closed on July 20th. So, obviously, that was during the quarter. Also we announced a cash offer to acquire William Hill during the quarter for 272p per share. That shareholder vote will take place on November 19th as is -- as needs to be the case under U.K. Takeover code. We cash confirmed the entire amount for that transaction including an equity offering that was just shy of $2 billion on October 1 of this year. We entered -- and we expanded our relationship with ESPN in the quarter on the sports betting side which we think is an exciting piece for customer acquisition for us. We've got a co-exclusive link out across all ESPN channels with DraftKings and we're excited with what that will bring to the table. We were also active on the asset sale front. We closed the sale -- or we announced the sale I'm sorry Tropicana Evansville for $480 million to Twin River and GLPI just about a week ago. You should expect to see more news in Indiana prior to the end of the year from us. And I would say a couple of things that I'd stress as takeaways and questions that I get on the operating side of the business, if you annualize the costs that are out of the business this quarter excluding gaming taxes, which obviously reduce as gaming revenue goes down. Our run rate cost reduction is about $2 billion from pre-COVID levels. There's obviously a lot of talk about what will come back, what won't come back. A lot of those costs are never coming back as I said, over the last several quarters. None of that has changed. As I said, I think, we're going to get to 35% to 40% EBITDA margins in a minimum. It's enjoyable from my seat to see our peers in the space reporting the same types of cost savings opportunities that we've been talking about for many years and to see Las Vegas locals margins in excess of 40% for the quarter and a couple of our peers. That's a road map to what's coming. You think about what revenue is missing from our business. It's the highest flow-through revenue in the business. It's hotel room rate and occupancy in Las Vegas. And what I --- I told you two quarters ago prior to the reopenings that you were going to be surprised with what regionals could do on the margin side. And we had another quarter where if you look at our peer regionals without destination properties, EBITDA was up substantially. Anthony will get into that. What I'd tell you today is, when we get into a post-COVID world, the pent-up demand you're going to see for gaming in general and Las Vegas in particular is going to be beyond your wildest dreams. Your -- and the flow-through that you're going to see in the sector is unlike anything that's happened historically in this space. And so, I can't tell you when is that going to happen. I can't -- I wish I could answer when the public health situation will change. But as we look at the pieces of our database that are missing or lagging they're the most profitable pieces of our database. It's the 55 and over cohort that's not coming. These are people that are not going anywhere and are not spending and are going to come out of this with significant pent-up demand and spending power. And it's going to be extremely powerful what you'll see I think across the entertainment space but particularly in casinos and particularly in Las Vegas. The other question I get all the time is about sports and online. And I'd tell you our New Jersey casino business continues to ramp up even after physical properties reopen. We're now on a run rate for $150 million of annual revenue out of the iGaming business in New Jersey at margins in the mid-30s. So we're extremely excited about that business. We think controlling our destiny in this space positions us to be a long-term winner. The ability to wrap our iGaming and our iCasino into a single wallet attached to your Caesars Reward database with the ability to earn and use points in any way that you'd like online or offline. Our customers truly get an immersive experience in this company. And you see it with what we're doing in Vegas. We think that's going to translate into the online business. And I don't really have a road map to what the ultimate size of this business will be. But I do know that if you're betting against the American people's propensity to gamble or you're betting against the de lure for states to attract tax revenue when their budgets are in the place that they are today that's been a losing bet since the dawn of civilization. So I feel real good about where we are where we're headed and I'll turn it over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you Tom and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to take a few minutes to provide you with some operational highlights for our portfolio during the third quarter. Before I begin, I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operations performed extremely well during these trying times due to the outstanding service that our guests receive on a daily basis from all of our great team members. Our success this quarter is a clear reflection of the commitment our team members who continue to work hard each day to provide a safe, healthy and exciting environment for our guests and their fellow team members. Now turning to operations. We now have 55 of our 56 properties reopened. As we mentioned in our press release, our regional properties are performing strongly. Within our regional segment and excluding destination markets like Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans and Tahoe, our regional properties generated a revenue decline of 11% and EBITDA growth of 10% leading to over 700 basis points of margin expansion. 10 properties had margin growth of over 1000 basis points. In total and including the destination markets in our regional portfolio regional EBITDA for the third quarter was $447 million. Now turning to Las Vegas and our regional destination markets. Starting with Las Vegas, we now have every property open except the Rio. We generated $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in Las Vegas in the quarter with operating performance improving each month throughout the quarter leading to a strong month of September. We continue to see strong occupancy trends on the weekend in excess of 90% with midweek occupancy still running the 50% to 60% range. We were encouraged when Governor Sisolak lifted the meeting caps from 50 to 250 people which has allowed us to host some small group meetings in Q4. Excluding the closed properties during the quarter, property level EBITDA was approximately $100 million. Our destination markets in the regional portfolio displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter leading to September showing -- displayed sequential improvement in operating performance throughout the quarter leading to September showing material improvement in the rate of EBITDA decline versus July and August. These regional destination properties with large hotel room portfolios are slowly recovering as operations return to normal and customers are returning to the properties. Overall, our immediate actions to reduce operating expenses at our reopened properties contributed to a leaner cost structure that we believe will contribute to sustainable EBITDA margin expansion. We are encouraged by the performance of the regional markets and the sequential rate of change in property performance within our destination markets during the quarter. With that I'll now turn the call over to Bret for some additional insights on the third quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret? Brett Yunker : Great. Thanks Anthony. As everyone on the call is aware we had quite an active third quarter even by our own standards. We closed on the Caesars merger on July 20 and subsequently announced the proposed transaction to acquire William Hill PLC on September 30. As we mentioned in the press release our quarter ending balance sheet was impacted by the cash required to be placed in escrow for William Hill in connection with the Rural 2.7 announcement. On October 1, we completed a public equity offering of 35.6 million shares generating net proceeds of $1.95 billion. Additionally in early October we entered into a \u00a31.5 billion interim facilities agreement with two large international banks. Execution of this committed debt finance allowed us to release $2 billion of cash that have been escrowed on September 30, allowing us to fully repay a $900 million draw on our parent revolver and return excess cash liquidity to our balance sheet. As of today both of our revolvers are undrawn and our unrestricted cash position is over $2 billion. Based on current operating trends, we expect to end the year with a similar level of cash on hand and 0 revolver balances. As I mentioned on our second quarter call our approach to maintenance and growth capital investment will be focused and disciplined. Over the next 12 months we expect to spend approximately $300 million to $350 million on CapEx excluding any Atlantic City-specific CapEx that's already been escrow. With that I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks Brett. Let me give you -- before we go to questions let me add a few comments on cadence of business since the quarter. Sequentially it continues to get stronger. October was better than September. September was better than August. If you think about what that looks like in Las Vegas, I'm going to give you some numbers that I'm not -- we're not in the habit of giving you but given the cloudiness of business as you look at the COVID world, I think it's useful. If you look at EBITDAR by month for us in Las Vegas. July was $10 million positive and these are aggregate numbers to include the losses from properties that were shut down. So $10 million in July $16 million in August, $34 million in September and October should push $50 million. We've got preliminary numbers. We've not closed the month yet. So Vegas continues to get better for us. We're not going to be talking about shutting properties mid-week. Obviously, we're talking about opening additional properties. We opened Cromwell last week. I'd expect to see Rio open before the end of the year. On the group side, the second half of 2021 and beyond, have record business on our books. Q2 to Q4 2021 are well ahead of our 2019 pace, and bookings were strong in the third quarter basically a normal level of bookings. If you look at the Caesars Forum Convention Center, which was opened for about 1.5 days before everything shutdown from COVID. Caesars Forum has 172 events, 1.6 million room nights contracted worth over $600 million in rooms and banquet revenue and 78% of that business is new to Las Vegas. And what I tell you is none of that matters, if the public health situation does not improve. But we are heartened by Governor Sisolak recent movement toward socially distance meeting business, and his statement that he's looking to go to 50% capacity by the beginning of 2021. That should help us save some first half 2021 business. But first quarter, you should expect we'll look very much like the last three quarter -- the second quarter third quarter of 2020 and this quarter as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. So Tom, I want to start in Vegas. And if you look at this point, you said your occupancies are running above 90% on the weekends, mid-50s weekdays. Is there any way to kind of think about that weekend kind of traffic? How much of that business in terms of the mid-90s is kind of a cash business versus whether that's a comp business or a reward redemption? Tom Reeg : So you should presume that if you look at our historical mix Steve, the convention business has been replaced by casino block business, and that the other segments remain relatively constant as you look back. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then the comments you made about demand is going to be, I think you said beyond either My Wildest Dreams or Your Wildest Dreams. Was that mostly related to Vegas? Is that kind of across the entire across the entire U.S.? Tom Reeg : It's across the entire U.S. When I tell you that, our 55 and over group is significantly lagging the rest of the business, that's throughout the country. And those are the people that tend to skew to older population that are not leaving their houses right now. My mother is one of those. And when you get a vaccine and you have freedom movement and feel better in terms of the likelihood of contracting COVID, I think that the pent-up demand for Vegas and for entertainment generally is well beyond what anyone is thinking today. Steve Wieczynski : And have you seen any change in that 55 and over kind of crowd recently? Tom Reeg : It's -- everything is kind of grinding a little bit better every month, month-over-month, but it's baby steps. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. And then last question. So with William Hill, and I'm not sure how much you can say given the pending, the deal hasn't closed yet. But let's say that deal does go through and you talked about that single app. Do you have any idea yet in terms of when that single app would be deployed? Tom Reeg : I'm extremely limited in what I can speak to on William Hill outside of the four corners of the document. You can presume that we were already working in that direction in the former iteration and we would continue to work in that direction post-closing. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : Hey, how are you? So, it's now been about 3.5 months since you bought Caesars. Can you talk a little bit about additional synergy opportunities you've found that you've kind of been under the hood for a bit longer? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean so, the whole synergy discussion as we talked about was turned on its head by COVID. It's really a question of what comes back rather than what do you subtract. But, Caesars ran differently than Eldorado just from a basic day-to-day operation standpoint. We run our properties off of daily P&Ls across every property that we own. Caesars measurement of EBITDA was far less frequent than that. And there wasn't a lot -- the operators didn't really have the tools to compare themselves across properties within the system. So when we were Eldorado as a private company and we were in two markets, we could look at those two markets and say what are we doing well in one versus the other. When you've got 55, that ability becomes much, much stronger. That's a benefit of scale. And Caesars was not taking advantage of that in our estimation. And you can imagine that we are, what took us the better part of two months to get to a daily P&L and we're still working through the kinks in the Caesars system, but we just went through our first round of quarterly reviews and it's eye opening for the operators to see, when I'm looking at each line item, each department and versus others in my market or other similar properties, things that I was unaware that I was inefficient in become obvious. And that sort of block -- basic blocking and tackling is what we're working through now. And that's why I tell you, I have an extreme level of confidence in hitting our margin targets here. Thomas Allen : That's helpful. And then just on the sports bar and gaming, any updated thoughts around branding? Tom Reeg : You should expect that we will use the Caesars brand for Caesars operated -- owned and operated properties. And for third-party properties, you should expect that the William Hill brand will live on in the U.S. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Thomas. Operator : Your next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Jared Shojaian : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom you talked about October, Vegas pushing $50 million in EBITDA. I know there's weird seasonality with Vegas right now in the fourth quarter without the group business and the convention business. Can you just help us think about November and December? Obviously, I know, it's dependent on a lot like New Year's Eve and other holidays, but how should we think about those two months? Are you assuming that sequential step-up you've been seeing pretty consistently can continue? Or is there some other factors to consider there? Tom Reeg : No. As you know, you're hitting a normal soft period in Vegas that November and then pre-December -- or pre-Christmas December. But what we're seeing is the reduction in volumes is not nearly what it's been historically at least in our business. So we feel good about posting a strong fourth quarter number in Las Vegas. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. And then I'll try to tackle this question a little differently. But if I think back to your most recent synergy target, the $800 million cost savings, the $100 million of revenue synergies, should we assume the entire $800 million of opportunity is already in that $2 billion number of costs that have been taken out. So really it's entirely just a matter of getting the revenue back? Or are there still some additional costs you think you could take out and then presumably, the $100 million of revenue synergies is still outstanding. Is it fair to say you really haven't gotten any of that yet? Tom Reeg : Yes. The revenue synergies, yes, absolutely. On the cost side, the one piece that came through COVID relatively unscathed on the Caesars side was corporate. You can see in our numbers that we cut about $200 million from -- on an annualized basis from corporate and that's what we expected to do. And you can see that that's complete. You should presume the rest of the cost savings are included in those numbers. But if you think about, we had an $800 million target between cost and revenue, $100 million was revenue. So $700 million of costs, they did about $11 billion -- the combined company is about $11 billion of revenue at a -- let's call it, a 28% margin for 2019. So, if we were to get to our 35% left side of the range that I've been talking about, that's almost $800 million of just cost savings. And, obviously, if we get to 40, there\u2019s more than that. Jared Shojaian : Okay, great. And maybe just to quickly follow up on that. I think you're divesting a lot more properties than you had initially expected when you announced the deal, is that positive, negative or neutral to the margin? Tom Reeg : It depends on the properties. I would say, of the properties that we've sold and that we're anticipating selling, all of those would be -- removing them from the equation would be accretive to that overall margin target. Jared Shojaian : Okay, great. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. John DeCree : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Tom, Bret I wanted to ask you guys a little bit about deleveraging from here and the capital that you raised this quarter earmarked for William Hill. You talked in the past about at some point selling a strip asset just to help delever more quickly. But based on what you see now and the amount of costs that have come out of the business and your kind of outlook for margin how do you approach deleveraging from here? Is it going to be through EBITDA growth? I mean you have some asset sales that you just talked about will help. But just curious to get your thoughts on the cadence over the next 12 months or 18 months ways that you'll work down leverage. Bret Yunker : Yes, it's really going to be a combination of all of the above. Again we're hopeful that we're nearing an inflection point here where we start generating strong free cash flow post this health crisis. So that's obviously number one alongside that we've been announcing asset sales and we expect to continue announcing them going forward. So that will be part of the package. And Las Vegas, we want to get past the health crisis and then think about monetizing an asset here. So all three of those alongside the denominator growing sequentially is going to help us deleverage in the next 12 months to 24 months. John DeCree : Thanks, Bret. And Tom on the sports and Isle Casino strategy assuming the transaction with William Hill proceeds and you look at your portfolio of brands and assets do you see any need or opportunity to add additional either services or brands or partners for that portfolio? You've got a big one with ESPN. Are there is there still more to do as you continue to build out business? Tom Reeg : This is all about building market share profitably and making your customers as sticky as possible. And so we think we have the building blocks to do that with what we'll have post the William Hill transaction, but we'll always be looking to improve upon that. And I've found it interesting to see non-gaming entities look into this space just the IAC movement into MGM, obviously, what ESPN did with us and DraftKings. Obviously there are a lot of companies out there who are looking for share of wallet and screen time on your phone. So it wouldn't surprise me if you see more of that as we move into the future. And if there were a partnership or a transaction that would improve our position and we could execute it in a manner that was that created additional debt value for our stakeholders we would certainly take a serious look. John DeCree : All right. Thanks for taking questions guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question guys. I wanted to drill into the regional gaming EBITDA $44 million or I guess, maybe more importantly the 33% margin. You noted that it was hamstrung by some of these regional, I guess, destination properties in Lake Charles being closed. I was wondering if you were willing to I guess help us think about what the drag was or if these properties had been punching at the same level as the other assets what the result would have been? Any more color just on kind of the impact there and how to think about that going forward? Thanks Tom Reeg : So you've got New Jersey, Reno and New Orleans that are your biggest drags obviously like Charles this quarter given the storm. But in the -- in terms of materiality, but three are in Atlantic City, Reno, New Orleans. Atlantic City opened very beginning of the quarter. You had no alcohol service, you had no food service and significant limitations on capacity that lasted for a significant period of time during your peak season in Atlantic City. So Atlantic City comps, obviously look poor. In Reno, we had the silver legacy tower open. We had a fair amount of Eldorado rooms open. We did not have the Circus Circus 1600 rooms opened at all. Again in the seasonal peak for the market. And then New Orleans \u2013 in New Orleans is a significant national database receiver of business. People not traveling New Orleans as a market as their restrictions are stricter than the state itself. You have legislative mandated labor count in New Orleans and you have a text system where we paid a fixed rate in the quarter versus the variable rate that we typically pay. So those three properties are significant drags as we move into fourth quarter and you get into the shoulder season Reno Atlantic City look a lot better because you're doing pretty well on a comp basis midweek in those markets when properties weren't full this time last year. And the weekend drop-off is not nearly what it was in the summer. New Orleans still has all of the same issues that it had in the third quarter. Chad Beynon : Great. Really helpful. And then Bret just on the cash flow side could you just remind us in terms of what the annual or quarterly cash interest and cash rent will be a little bit of noise in the reporting here but that would be helpful. Bret Yunker : Yes putting GAAP aside on a pure cash basis we're roughly $2 billion all in of annual master lease, rent payments and interest expense so you can just divide that by four for the quarters. Tom Reeg : About $1.2 billion of rent and $800 million of interest. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Dan Politzer with JPMorgan. Dan Politzer : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping that you could give maybe an update on your iGaming rollout and when we could expect to see your launch in Pennsylvania more formally at least. And maybe if there's any plans for Michigan and if you have a market access agreement there? Tom Reeg : Yes on Michigan and intention to roll out there Pennsylvania I don't know... Bret Yunker : Yes. We're live in Pennsylvania, Dan right now. We're rolling out more product and more games as every day and week passes. So we're expecting to see incremental opportunities in 2021 as these new products are rolled out. So we would be optimistic on sort in Pennsylvania in 2021. Also in the state of New Jersey we're going to be launching live dealer on the Caesars side for iGaming. So that's an exciting opportunity as well. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks. And then in Virginia there was recently passed legislation that legalized gaming in Danville, where you talked about building a casino. Could you maybe talk to us about \u2013 a little bit about the project potential cost and return the competitive environment there and how you're thinking about this at a high level? Tom Reeg : Yes. So the project that was approved, we'd expect 20% returns on roughly a $400 million investment. Keep in mind as you look at that project that's in the radius of the Cherokee property that we operate in North Carolina and the tribe has the opportunity and the option to opt in up to 80% of the equity of the Danville property and that became available to them upon the passage the vote on Tuesday. So it's too early to say where that will eventually end. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the WH acquisition and essentially why now and the degree to which you get closed on it what kind of tech investment and/or marketing spend you envision might be required to be a leader with it right would be successful with it? Tom Reeg : Yes. So we \u2013 as we looked at the opportunity in the space, as I've said, I think this is the most significant growth opportunity in the casino space since River Boats were legalized in the '90s. We were looking at the partnership that we brought in from the Eldorado side where if you recall we entered that partnership knowing that Eldorado's brand was unlikely to play on a national basis. We wanted to form a partnership with a respective sports betting operator that had a national strategy where we could participate in the upside. We subsequently bought Caesars, who obviously has a very different brand situation than Eldorado and it became clear that we have a brand that can resonate on a national level. We've got a database that can feed into that business. And we had been talking about how should we proceed with the partnership. If you recall the partnership included sports betting and not include sports betting and not Internet casino. If you're going to get to a single wallet solution in both. So it really wasn't ideal for either partner in the current landscape. So as we looked at potential solutions, it became clear to us that the best answer for us was to control our own destiny here. And so we started discussions about a purchase and ended up where you saw us end up. On the marketing question, the combined company here, the combined pro forma entity iGaming and sports does about $100 million. We'll do about $100 million in EBITDA, positive EBITDA, not the $200 million, $300 million of negative EBITDA that you're accustomed to in the space it will do $100 million of positive EBITDA. That includes all of the marketing that we're doing now. So if you see us ramp-up marketing, it's from an EBITDA positive position. In terms of the tech spend William Hill has been spending a significant amount of capital, developing its Liberty platform that rolled out in New Jersey to strong reviews. They're in the process of continuing to roll that out throughout the U.S. You're never going to stop spending on tech, but I don't see a significant material tech spend that's \u2013 you should be plugging into your model that's going to be a giant stock of cash. You should be thinking of $10 million, $20 million a year neighborhood. David Katz : Okay. And I recall, I hope I have your terminology correct, but the notion that iGaming and sports betting may warrant its own brain at some point. How have you thought about making sure that that business can grow and achieve what it needs to achieve under your roof versus its own roof? Tom Reeg : So, it will be an unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment upon closing, post the Caesars acquisition Eric Hashan and Chris Holden out of the Caesars side agreed to stay as co-President of that business for us. Christian Stewart on the operations side has been invaluable in this process for us will remain involved. So you will see it as it \u2013 it will operate as a subsidiary of its own you will be able to see the numbers of it on its own then the question becomes what's the best structure from a capital markets perspective. And we have time to make those decisions. The expectation at the outset is it will be a wholly owned unrestricted sub of Caesars Entertainment, will not have its own currency. But as you know, we are 100% focused on driving value to our shareholders. And if the right answer is it becomes a separate entity with its own currency. You might see us head in that direction in the future. David Katz : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Barry Jonas : Hey, guys. I wanted to start with Vegas. Can you maybe just talk about the reintroduction of entertainment? How profitable do you think that can be either directly or indirectly? And then also, what's been the response so far to the return of paid parking? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yeah. So, on the question of entertainment, we're absolutely thrilled that we've seen movement in that area and the ability to operate with our \u2013 some fairly small venue entertainment across the city. What you're seeing come back. You're not seeing headline entertainment come back. You're not seeing big production shows come back. What you're seeing are the 500, 600 seats that are now offering 100, 200 seats. It's not a hugely profitable business on its own, but it creates additional reason to visit the market and that's important to us. Every piece that we get that becomes another reason for someone to make the move to either drive here or fly here and stay in the market is good for the whole market. So we're extremely pleased that we're able to offer entertainment today. The initial response has been extremely strong and we're happy to have it back. Now, the issue of parking, you got a heavy drive-in business now. As I said, we're mid-90 to high 90s occupancy on the weekends as you \u2013 and you know that we have kind of 50-yard line real estate on strip. So what we were finding was our best customers were having difficulty finding parking in our garages, even if they had a lodging reservation. And so what we wanted to do was, to bring back parking \u2013 to bring back parking fees, as kind of a hurdle so that our best customers can get to the property. If we \u2013 if you are significant Caesars reward customer you're a lodger or you're a local you're not paying for parking. And to drive home the point that, this was for those purposes and because of the situation that we've seen in Nevada, we \u2013 as we implemented we said, we're going to donate all of our profits from parking for this quarter and next to local charities that support the community and those that have been displaced by COVID. So the response has been overwhelmingly positive, from the city and from our customers. Barry Jonas : That's great. And then just a follow-up, how are you thinking about, I guess, OpCo mix to the business now? Tom in the past, you've talked about sort of like a 50-50 mix. Is that still the goal once the dust settles? Tom Reeg : Yeah. You shouldn't see us doing sale-leaseback transactions of -- or sales of real estate that will skew that. As you've seen us in the past we've utilized the propco market for financing typically for transactions, so were there something to come up that, made sense. It could be a tool that's used. But I don't expect us to be particularly acquisitive from here so you shouldn't see much movement on the real estate side. Barry Jonas : Great. Thank you so much. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Barry. Operator : Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Two questions, just wanted to go back to the, sort of regional margin performance. If we look at the kind of the numbers on a core basis, let's talk about those 700 basis points. Is it fair just as we think about, continued recognition of some of the synergies in some of your initiatives that 700 basis points could actually improve or accelerate from here? Or do you think this is a good reflection of what the ability of the business can be, when everything else starts to settle in? Tom Reeg : You should expect that the -- that it can continue to grow, because as I talked about earlier, what's missing from the business is some of your highest flow-through revenue. So as that starts to come back, into these markets. And I'm thinking particularly of Atlantic City Reno and New Orleans, flow-through is quite high. And their contribution to the total regional pie, in a post -- in a post-COVID world, should drive the entire regional sector margin higher. Shaun Kelley : That's really helpful, Tom. And then sort of a separate, but big picture strategic question, so there's been some discussion as it relates to William Hill and I guess the bigger kind of picture strategy here, as it relates to this kind of single wallet or access to the customer probably via an app. And I'm just kind of curious like Caesars always took a pretty centralized or increasingly moved to a centralized marketing approach. Tom and Eldorado, I think without mischaracterizing, you guys were always pretty focused on a decentralized approach, to really accessing the customers and empowering, some of the local property managers. How do you think about that in the digital realm? So just sort of, how do you kind of like connect all this together, as it relates to software and one vision of the customer? Does it sort of need to be centralized? Or can you balance those two approaches? And how would you sort of go about doing it? Or does anything need to change? Tom Reeg : I think you should think about it as to, how we operate the entire business. What will differentiate us in this space is the stickiness of our customers, the immersion in our network. If you think about -- I know your -- in the pre-COVID world, you'd be a frequent traveler like I was. Think of the gymnastics you would go through, to make sure that you're flying on your favorite airline or you're staying in your hotel, where you've got the most points. That's what we've got in the Caesars Rewards system. And it's a much broader relationship than just, how much money did I give you to place your sports bet, on my app. It's a much stickier customer. So you shouldn't think of the sports betting marketing is going to be materially different, than the way that we built the business, on the bricks-and-mortar side. I understand there's this race for market share and handle. And all the numbers that come out monthly right now. This is a long game. I go back to my riverboat example. I remember calling on names like, Casino Magic and Casino America and Players International Argosy Gaming, all of those ultimately went away and got consolidated into the leaders in the business. That's where we're going to end up. You are in inning one of, if you're thinking in baseball terms what ultimately will be an extra inning game. And we're assembling the building blocks, to be a winner here long-term, to attract as much market share as we can over time profitably, but make sure that it's sticky. I can make my market share in any individual market; look the way that I wanted to look to report to you at the end of the month, if I throw enough money at it. That's not how we do business. That's not how you should expect us to tackle this area. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back for closing remarks. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you in 2021, after fourth quarter. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We are thrilled to close the book on 2020. It was, by any measure, the most challenging year that we've had operationally and personally to date. The fourth quarter was no exception to that. I want to start the call by recognizing all of our front-line employees. They lived through the vast majority of our employees being furloughed, then coming back into an environment where they were fearful for health and safety, fearful for what was happening at home with children or parents or grandparents or all of the above. And they came back and delivered the exceptional service that our customers are accustomed to at Caesars and operated through some extraordinary contact tracing changes in regulations, reopenings, closings throughout the year and we couldn't be prouder of them. For the fourth quarter, we did $346 million of EBITDA. We've listened and read others\u2019 calls are cadence with similar almost half of our EBITDA happened in October. And then as regulation - restrictions tightened across the country, November and December were sequentially less than October and we think the bottom for the business and we'll talk about what we've seen in January and February and going forward that makes us highly confident of that. In Las Vegas, we did a $100 million of EBITDA, adding back the Rio rent payment, which we're proud of on a relative basis. But we know on an absolute basis, we've got a lot of wood to chop in Vegas as it reopens. We're seeing some encouraging signs there that I'll discuss. In the regional markets in the quarter, we had significant restrictions in Nevada, New Jersey, Colorado, Ohio that related to operating hours. We had closures in Illinois, Pennsylvania that - and the Lake Charles property from the prior hurricane. If you exclude just the closed properties, you include everything that had the operating restrictions, our regional EBITDA margins were up about 400 basis points for the quarter. So still seeing through the noise strong evidence on the cost side that those - that progress is continuing. If you look at - when I'm speaking to investors, I'm often asked what am I missing, what is the market missing. And what I think the market is missing now is similar to what I talked about in the last quarterly call, the demand that is coming as the world reopens and the flow through that you should expect to see in this business post reopening is wildly underestimated by the markets. I see kind of across the board in the sector a view in numbers estimates out there that suggests we get back to 2019 numbers kind of sometime in 2023. I'm firmly convinced that we will be at least run rating those numbers. The first quarter that Vegas group business is back in earnest and that could be as early as the second-half of this year. So I think there is - there needs - there should be a dramatic pull forward of expectations of the turn and I'll give you a few examples of why I believe this to be the case. Currently in Las Vegas, we are at our highest level of bookings since reopening. January and February have ramped up, it's almost like a switch was flipped, sometime late January, early February. Our bookings are up 20% on a month-over-month basis in the FIT and casino segment. The - we measure gross and net pickup. So gross pickup is how many aggregate rooms are booked in a day or a week or whatever period you're looking at. Net pickup is bookings less cancellations. And if you look at our gross and net bookings, 9 of our top 10 days since the pandemic reopening in Las Vegas happened in February, with Monday being the highest that we have seen to date. Importantly, the booking window is extending as well. So if you look back to from reopening until the end of 2020, it seemed like you had a lot of impulse trips, very short booking windows. What we're seeing now is almost half of our bookings are for trips that are at least 30 days out, which is about double the pace that we had in the fourth quarter. So we are extremely encouraged by that. If you look at our actual performance in January and February, January was well in excess of November and December, approached October in terms of EBITDA. February has been strong as well, obviously, with fewer days in the month ultimately. But if we - as we look forward at our forward-booking forecasts, by mid-March, we're well into the 50s in terms of percentage occupancy mid-week on the strip and we're 95%-plus on weekends. If you look at our group business, for the second-half of the year, we've got 32% more room nights on the books for the second-half of 2021 than we had for the second-half of 2019 on the same day. Now, I'll grant you that we didn't have forum convention center in the fourth quarter of 2019, but you're talking about almost $200 million of room night revenue on the books for the second-half of the year for group business. And remember, when we talk about group business, those are the rooms that are booked for the actual event. So as those groups come and your guests decide to come early, bring their way, bring their family stay a little longer, those rooms are not included in that group room night business. So we know that there is a lot of discussion and debate and prognostication about when the world will reopen. We're certainly heartened by all of the recent data, the vaccine advances in terms of coming supply. We're heartened by Governor Sisolak in Nevada, providing a path that has us in position where we could be hosting group business by the middle of this year in earnest. And so we think there is light at the end of the tunnel there. And when you look at - we're messaging to our internal operators is let's make sure that all of the cost discipline that we have found over the last year or so remains in place as business comes back. And we had kind of an anomaly in the fourth quarter in the Tahoe market, where California's regulations were far more stringent than Nevada. So you kind of got an early burst of demand that would sort of simulate what will happen in a reopening. And our team up there, John Koster, and his team did a fantastic job of maintaining discipline on the cost side, so that Tahoe was up 7% in gaming revenue in the fourth quarter, was up almost 60% in EBITDA with EBITDA margins growing by over 1,100 basis points. And it's that type of view that admittedly, you don't get to see that gives me optimism. If you look anecdotally at this past Saturday night in Las Vegas, nothing particularly interesting about it. It was - we were 95% occupied. So you get to see what we look like virtually full, we were 99% last year at higher rates. There was nothing particularly notable about hold or high-end play in - on that night. And our EBITDA margins currently are running several hundred basis point points ahead of last year, same-day. So as this business comes back, you're talking about filling rooms, room revenue that's extremely high margin, you're talking about high-end restaurant business coming back. You're talking about Entertainment coming back, I think the recovery that's going to happen. The pace of it is going to be - the magnitude of it is going to be far more dramatic that I see model in the pace in my mind is certainly going to be much, much quicker and we're now what seven, eight months post closing the Caesars transaction. So we have done obviously quite a bit of integration post transaction and I tell you that we have already well exceeded all of the synergy targets that we have out there and expect that to remain to be the case, even after the World reopens and some of the costs come back. We think we'll be well in excess of both our pre-pandemic targets and the targets we added to during the pandemic. And then finally in terms of my opening remarks, William Hill, I am still limited in what I can - we can say about that given that the transaction has not closed yet. But we have two remaining kind of full regulatory meetings, one in Nevada, which is actually a two parter, and then one in Indiana. We anticipate both happening in March, then we have a final court date in the U.K., which is set for March 30th. Once we clear those, we will have cleared everything that we need to do to get closed, so you should expect us to be closing some time post that court hearing. We are working through all of the integration of William Hill, particularly on the tech side, we think we will be well positioned to have one of the best apps in the industry integrated into Caesars rewards on both the sports side and to be casino side by the beginning of the football season in 2021. And with that I'll flip to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thanks Tom, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. While 2020 was certainly a challenging year on many levels, I am extremely proud of our team members and their extraordinary dedication and commitment to running great properties. Our success this year could not have been accomplished without our team members' tireless efforts each day, to provide a safe and healthy environment for our guests. Now turning to operations, in Las Vegas, we generated $90 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $100 million of property level EBITDA, excluding the real rent payments. EBITDA improved over 40% on a quarterly sequential basis. October was our strongest month where we generated approximately $50 million of EBITDA. Total occupancy for Q4 was 60% with weekend occupancy up 80% and midweek occupancy of 50%. Casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was over 50% during Q4. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the booking trends for the second-half of '21. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second-half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up over 30% and we are seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group pace is up 10% in room nights, with strong rate growth versus this time last year. As we have mentioned before, future business on the books remains uncertain, but the strength of forward bookings tell us our customers are anxious to return to Las Vegas. On the FIT side, our booking pace continues to accelerate and its at - at its highest level since reopening. Our booking windows are extending as well 47% of Las Vegas market bookings since the beginning of the year or for at least 30 days out, almost double the percentage that we saw in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we were planning several property improvements in Las Vegas, including completely transforming the arrival experience at Caesars Palace which has largely been untouched since the property opened in 1966. In addition, we will be adding several exciting new food and beverage concepts across our Vegas properties. In our regional markets, operating results were negatively impacted by property closures and incremental COVID-19 restrictions during the quarter. At our closed properties, we continued to pay team members salaries and benefits throughout the quarter. In our regional non-destination properties and excluding property closures, revenues were down 17%, EBITDA was down 6%, and EBITDAR margins improved approximately 400 basis points. 10 regional properties within the portfolio reported quarterly EBITDA and our EBITDAR margin records. We have spent the last year refining our cost structure in both our destination and regional markets and we expect meaningful EBITDA flow through as recovery unfolds in '21. This should also lead to higher sustainable EBITDAR margins. We are excited about the year ahead and we remain confident in the eventual recovery of travel and tourism in the U.S. and especially here in Vegas. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brett for some additional insights on the fourth quarter and details on our balance sheet and capital structure. Bret? Bret Yunker : Thanks Anthony. So we decided to mix things up a bit in the fourth quarter and went from buyers to sellers, with the most significant announcements being the sale of two of our Indiana assets yielding us over $1 billion of rent adjusted debt relief, over 700 million of which is in the form of cash proceeds that we expect to receive during the second and third quarters of 2021. These proceeds further augment approximately $4 billion of year-end liquidity across our unrestricted cash on hand and available revolvers. We are well positioned to close on William Hill, which as Tom mentioned, we expect to happen early in the second quarter and our nearest debt maturities in December of 2024. CapEx for 2021 is expected to land between $350 million and $400 million, excluding Atlantic City and Lake Charles which we will be funding from Escrow and insurance proceeds. Back to you, Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Brett. With that, we will open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jared Shojaian : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Tom, I really appreciate all that commentary, that was extremely helpful. Do you think we need to see Vegas meaningfully improve to the levels that you're talking about and getting back to those prior 2019 run rates? Before we see a Vegas asset sale, is that kind of how you're thinking about it? Tom Reeg : Yes. So - and thanks for asking that question because I should've addressed that in the opening remarks. I've read a lot of comments about how we're about to sell Planet Hollywood. If whoever knows what's happening there can call me and tell me what we're getting for it, I'd appreciate it. There are no assets for sale in Las Vegas in our portfolio. We do still anticipate selling an asset in the future, but I want to be marketing that asset off of actual performance under our stewardship not having to build a story, build a bridge to what it's doing today versus what we think it will be doing. So I would say, based on what I'm seeing, you should expect a sale unlikely to take place in 2021, probably looking at some time in 2022, most likely first-half. Jared Shojaian : Okay. Thank you. And just to switch gears here on sports betting and iGaming, I know, Tom, in the past, your message has been that your interactive digital business is profitable, whereas competitors are not. I guess a multipart question here. Is online sports betting and iGaming profitable for you? I know iGaming is, but I guess the first question is, is online sports profitable as well? And how has your strategy evolved on that thinking? I mean do you think that it's time to start getting more promotional and start to capture more market share? Maybe you can just help us think about how you're thinking about that? And then do you need to get this William Hill deal closed before you start maybe a more robust strategy on that front? Tom Reeg : So I am limited in what I can say here. The answer to the first question is, yes, we are profitable in all verticals in that business. On the second piece, William Hill has been in a bit of suspended animation, since we announced the transaction, where, obviously, they were not integrated into Caesars when we announced it. There is not a lot that we're able to do in the period between signing and closing. So William Hill face a situation where they had a brand that they knew was ultimately going to go away as the main driver of the business. So it made little sense to spend a lot of money to build the brand that's going to change early in 2021. We have not been in-charge of that, the operating side of that business in the past. So we will - we're in this to be a winner. And if the answer is, we need to invest more money to build market share and whatever form that takes, you should expect that we would consider that. I consider us to be a pretty strong operating team. You shouldn't expect that to be any different when we're managing the sports and online business. Jared Shojaian : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DeCree from Union Gaming. Your line is open. John DeCree : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess to maybe build off that last discussion a little bit, Tom, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the iGaming trajectory. I think the last discussion talking about profitability in that segment and it's a business that Caesars has been in for a while. I think we've seen some legislation float around in Illinois and being considered Indiana. So a lot of discussion on sports betting, but it seems like Caesars has a particular advantage given the experience in iGaming. And curious to get your thoughts on the pace of that market rollout? Tom Reeg : Yes, John, as we've discussed, I think, the miss in that area of the market in terms of expectations is the view that iGaming is going to significantly trail sports and ultimately not be legalized in nearly as many jurisdictions in my experience when states start to see the revenue feeding in from something like sports. I think their inclination is going to be to expand that and iGaming is certainly an easy path there. I'm encouraged by the January numbers that we saw and effectively 2.5 states that suggest iGaming from a total market standpoint is already pushing $3 billion. We are significantly profitable there that business keeps growing for us. We obviously think we are well-positioned there and in sports with Caesars awards. And we think we're well-positioned to take advantage as iGaming continues to roll out. John DeCree : Tom, if I could ask a follow-up on that. I'm not sure how much detail you're prepared or can talk about. But we get a lot of questions on crossover play and I don't know if you have any stats out of New Jersey or anecdotally, if you could tell us anything about how much of the Caesars rewards database was playing on online or how many customers were acquired online into the Caesars casino for iGaming specifically? Tom Reeg : Yes, I'm not going to be disclosing that level of detail until we've - after we've closed William Hill out of an abundance of caution. John DeCree : Fair enough. I can appreciate that. If I could ask a second one instead on daily fantasy sports. You've made a minority investment in the business and obviously, the cross-sell rate we've seen from competitors has been pretty high. But I wonder if you could give us a high-level on the strategy and thought process as to how you might leverage that going forward? Tom Reeg : Yes, for us it was twofold really. You have - we think we were acquiring the customers at a particularly attractive acquisition cost and the ability to fold it into Caesars Rewards quickly and their capabilities positioned us well to start to grow that business. And it was also obvious - an obvious hole in our lineup as we talked with our partners in the sports world both teams and the NFL itself. So we - that was effectively what we did was we rolled our flutter stock that we got in the TSG skins deal into the investment into SuperDraft, which given - what it happened to flutter stock and where we think we can take SuperDraft, we thought that was a good trend for us. John DeCree : Understood. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Tom, you obviously talked a lot about kind of the Las Vegas recovery and what you're seeing in group and noting that you believe you can be on kind of a 2019 run rate as early as the second-half of this year. So my question around that is just, obviously with the group demand, you guys see on the books a pretty good visibility into it. Could you maybe quantify kind of what revenue level relative to 2019 you guys think you need to be at on a quarterly or annual run rate basis to kind of achieve 2019 like EBITDA levels in Las Vegas, specifically? Tom Reeg : I mean, I think you should be thinking about a minimum of 500 to 1,000 basis points of margin expansion on a consolidated basis. So you can do the math that backs into where would we get to call it $3.5 billion, which was the pro format, Eldorado, and Caesars numbers in '19 plus the $500 million of synergies we announced in the original deal. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. And that would be off the pro forma kind of 28 and change margin from 2019? Tom Reeg : Yes. I would expect these at a minimum and I think we'll be chasing 40 pretty quickly. Carlo Santarelli : And then if I could, just as you guys think about the regional portfolio, obviously you've had multiple transactions over the last year-plus. Is there anything else that you guys are looking at across the board in regional portfolio that you would consider kind of non-core any in regions where you feel like potentially that there could be something that you'd want to do to kind of clean up the portfolio or get it more tailored to kind of what you're trying to do with the business going forward? Tom Reeg : I would say unlikely that we would be buyer of anything material that's already operating domestically if markets like New York and Texas open up to commercial casinos. We would certainly take a hard look as to whether it would make sense for us to play there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : So when you announced about William Hill deal, you talked about reaching $600 million to $700 million bucks sports betting iGaming revenues in 2021. Do you still think that's a good target? Tom Reeg : I can't update any numbers that aren't in the public filings, Thomas. Thomas Allen : I thought it was worth a shot. So it's gears a little bit. When we think about the strength that we're going to see in Vegas, kind of, and hopefully in the second-half of this year into 2022. Can you just talk about how you're managing your rooms like are you holding back convention bookings because you think that kind of FIT business is going to be so strong? How do you do that? Thank you. Tom Reeg : No, I mean, keep in mind the - your booking windows are entirely different. When you're booking a convention, you're typically booking for many months or typically more than a year out. And we've got a block of rooms that typically rolls about 15% of our total room capacity and there is no need to artificially reduce that for expectations of what can happen. In FIT, we are really managing that from a rate perspective and we've got a team here led by Pavan Kapur, who is already at Caesars who are the best in the business at yielding and revenue management and that's been evident in our results for a couple of since the closing and that's what we lean on as we move forward. Thomas Allen : I am just asking that question in a different way. Like, are you guys keeping rates steady or even increasing rates for the groups that you are booking into 2022 and the second-half of the year because of your confidence around group. Tom Reeg : The group business in the second-half of the year is at higher rates than '19 and it's pure supply demand within that block. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : So, Tom if we go back to your biggest commentary around the group business could come back in some material form as early as the middle of this year. Look, I understand you have a significant amount of more room nights booked at this point, but I guess the question is how many - I don't know if you can answer this, but how many of these nights do you think will actually pan out or materialize, meaning the conventional group meeting takes place and those folks actually show up? Tom Reeg : Yes. And that's part of what Pavan's group does in terms of forecasting and managing the revenue. As you're assuming that in any environment, a 100% of those room nights aren't going to ultimately show up. The discount from what we would have been discounting in '19 in terms of expectation is - what would show up is larger, but we think given what we're seeing in FIT and casino in terms of that wave of demand, we feel very good about where will be, whenever that business does come back in earnest. Steve Wieczynski : And that's regardless of basically where airline capacity is at that point, does that have anything to do with it. Tom Reeg : Yes, I mean in our airline capacity in this market has been the lagging indicator. When you've got the demand for people to show up, more seats tend to flow to this market and that should in particular be the case in an environment where airline performance is as it's been. Steve Wieczynski : And then Tom or Brett. Can you update us on where you stand today in terms of leverage targets or goals and the timelines around potentially getting to those? And then Tom, I don't think we've talked about this in a while, but the original $10 free cash flow target, is that still in play. At this point. Tom Reeg : Yes, Steve, I see you started to creep down to $7.5 or $8, but I'm still at $10. Anthony Carano : I'll adjust. Bret Yunker : I'll adjust. Tom Reeg : I'm highly confident we will be $10 a share of free cash flow. The - in terms of leverage, nothing has changed. We have more leverage than certainly we anticipated going into the deal, obviously a function of the pandemic and we - you should expect us to be as soon as we are generating significant free cash flow. Again, you should expect us to be number one target is debt pay down and we fully expect to drive leverage sub-4 times on a gross lease adjusted basis. And as we do that, we'll see we reaching a point of diminishing returns in the equity or do you push it further. And we, as you know, Bret and I both come from fixed income background, so we tend to be a little more conservative here anyway and we recognize the benefit of the flexibility to be having less leverage provides and the wider potential equity buyer audience that it creates. And we are going to get there as soon as we possibly can. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : As you think about some of the upside that you found in the initial synergies in this potential March to 40%, where are the biggest opportunities being uncovered. Tom Reeg : I mean it's a whole different operating model, Steve than it was before. We've been talking about this since reopening. The marketing environment is entirely different, the pieces of the properties that are open are entirely different and some of the most labor intensive pieces or the areas where you were losing the most money are never coming back. And layer on top of that, we were in the middle of a combination in the merger that would normally lead to synergies through reducing redundant capacity and Caesars was certainly much heavier in the corporate departments than we have historically run and if you roll all that together, that's how we get to the margins we expect we can get to. Stephen Grambling : And I guess as an unrelated follow up, when you see this ebb and flow of customers and restrictions both in Vegas at the regional properties, how has the customer that's showing up evolve, are you seeing new customers that are signing up for the rewards program or is it mainly existing customers' rewards program. Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes, you've got a mix of both obviously given the size and the effectiveness of the Caesars reward system, we've seen a lot of rated play come back, but we have seen significant increases in the under-35 crowd that unfortunately is more than offset by decreases in the over-55 crowd. And in terms of how it's evolved, it's been a fairly consistent kind of, everyone moving at the same time. If you segment our groups by or our business by rated and unrated or by age cohort, you've seen similar behavior in terms of how much they're down since reopening and then when the restrictions tightened and then when we started to reopen again. They've kind of moved in lockstep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. You may ask your question. Chad Beynon : Tom, I just wanted to follow up on your last remark there. I believe you mentioned that the regional - the non-destination regional revenues were down 17% in the quarter, obviously including markets with restrictions. Do you have a sense of what this was in periods and at properties where there weren't restrictions, or I guess more importantly when this starts to ease and we kind of get the vaccinations and do you think this can be closer to kind of a flat to slightly down, just trying to figure out what was intentional versus everything else that was going on in the quarter? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes, the answer is - short answer is the way you laid it out. Yes, if you took - obviously Chad, you know, we've got Atlantic City, Reno and New Orleans in our regional properties, which have heavy dependency on rooms. So those are the properties that were most impacted in the quarter in terms of restrictions. And if you went to our true regional assets, if you were trying to compare us to say Pandora or Boyd regional, you say, yes, we would have been around flat in revenue and EBITDA expansion would have been several hundred basis points ahead of the 400 basis points I pointed to earlier. Chad Beynon : And I know in the past you've said that you're not interested in any assets outside of the United States. Can you just confirm that? And then also give us an update on where the Korea project sits and if there is any additional capital that needs to be funded from your side of the relationship. Tom Reeg : So we still have the Windsor management contract in Ontario. We would expect that we're going to continue to operate that. You should expect that over time that will be the extent of our non-U.S. business. Ask again the second piece Chad? Korea? Chad Beynon : Korea. Yes, thank you. Tom Reeg : Korea has gone, we sold it for some barbecue pork although, we saw it back to our partners where we have no more commitment, we're out. I think that was in May month. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer of JP Morgan. Your line is open. Dan Politzer : Thanks for taking my question. Tom, you mentioned that you've seen an uptick in the younger unrated player similar to a lot of your peers. I guess, to what extent if any have you been able to kind of get them onto the Caesars rewards program and maybe start to cycle them through to maybe your sports betting or iGaming apps? Any color there would be helpful. Tom Reeg : We're pretty good at when people come to visit, signing them up to our program. The under-35 crowd has not been any different than any other new cohort that shows up at the properties, so we've converted them to Caesars Rewards. Remember that Caesars Rewards is not yet connected to sports and online since we have not closed the William Hill transaction. So it's not yet. Frankly as seamless as it will be a few months from now in terms of moving customers out of Caesars - from Caesars Rewards down to RX. Dan Politzer : Got it. All right. And then just kind of switching gears in terms of market access for sports betting. Your regional gaming footprints obviously among the largest of your peers. Can you remind me of some of the outstanding access agreements maybe you had, and I know you announced one today, but maybe if you could put some numbers around book gaming this opportunity as it relates to the high margin revenue here? Tom Reeg : That's another one I should wait till after we close William Hill. You're talking about the access agreement sales that we're doing? Dan Politzer : Right. Exactly so... Tom Reeg : Yes, I mean, let us get to as soon as we close William Hill, we can get some data out on that. I'm trying to stay within the four corners of what's been filed there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Adam of Loop Capital. Your line is open. Daniel Adam : Keeping it very simple, Tom, is it safe to conclude at this point that Las Vegas is now as things stand today in recovery mode. And then, just related to that, is it possible to see a full revenue recovery, not necessarily EBITDAR, but revenue recovery on the Strip, even if business travel and convention demand never fully return? Tom Reeg : If business travel, convention demand never fully returns, I don't think - I think you're going to have trouble getting back to 2019 revenue numbers. Remember that that group business, even though it's only 15% of our business, it's a big piece of cash operating income in high-end restaurants in Entertainment. So that's an important piece of our business, even though it's only 15% of our business. It's important piece of business for our peers in the market where it's larger. In terms of our - I would describe it as we've been wandering in the best for almost a year now since we started shutting down and you can clearly see the light shining through at this point in Las Vegas in terms of customer behavior. Just the people booking - that the pace of the booking and the fact that it's people actually planning trips in the future is a sea change from where it was in 2020. And given our database and what we can mine here, we feel very good presuming there are no further public health setbacks, which obviously is a big presumption given what we've seen. We feel very good that we've seen the bottom in Vegas and in the business and that we're only going to keep getting better sequentially. Daniel Adam : And then on the online gaming and sports betting side to the extent you can comment on this. So DraftKings and FanDuel currently seem to be the clear number one and two players in most markets with William Hill that MGM and I guess you can say Barstool, even though they're only in two states, sort of establishing themselves as the second tier in the market. I guess, longer-term, where do you think - within that second tier, where do you think long-term margins can settle on the iGaming and sports betting side, not necessarily commenting about William Hill specifically? Thanks. Tom Reeg : I think you're looking at a 25% to 30% EBITDA margin business at maturity for your top tier operators in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. You may ask your question. David Katz : Thanks for walking me in. I wanted to go back to the online question first, if I may and just speak high level and strategically as you're permitted to do, but is it a business where you believe you need to be in all of the available states, obviously some of the larger ones, it's obvious where you have access and others where you may not. Do you need to be in all the states to be successful, is that part of your definition? Tom Reeg : I mean it's part of our plan, we have access between what - we're in 15 states operating plus DC. It should be 20 jurisdictions by the end of this year. We have access to nearly 80% of the U.S. population in our system and you should expect us to be pursuing the opportunity everywhere that we can. David Katz : And with respect to just regional gaming again philosophically. We have so many discussions about sort of what the new regional gaming experience will be in a post-COVID world, and I think it's easy for all of us to slip into a discussion in absolute terms where margins are great in regional casinos, but there is nothing to eat, you need to lunch pail it. And perhaps there is the other end of the spectrum where we do cover operators who happen to like their food offerings and lead with it. My sense is, there is a reality that doesn't lie at either end of that spectrum. How are you thinking about that? Tom Reeg : So this is something we talk about quite a bit. Your customers in the regional market as we started to point out five plus years ago that they show up for hours at a time. It may be the case that happens to coincide with when they want to eat, they may get hungry well they are. You can have nothing, but you don't need to lose money nearly as - certainly nearly as much money as this industry has lost feeding people. I'm old enough to remember when casinos - we're only in Nevada and New Jersey and yet in those other 48 states, everybody figured out how to eat dinner. And once the casinos open, it became - how do we feed them dinner and let's just given away for free because got free they go, stop at McDonald's on the way home. We - I can't speak for what others will do, we're going to be smarter about where we are in and how we're in the food and beverage business and just make sure we're not bleeding 3 million in every buffet in the country. We're going to figure out how to do it in a way that meets customer demand and maximizes our profitability. David Katz : And it's not going to be something that is going to be a competitive decision along the way, right. It's not going to - it will be a competitive experience with what everyone else is doing for the most part? Tom Reeg : I am not concerned that I'm hamstring myself competitively with my food and beverage offerings. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas of Truist Securities. Your line is open. Barry Jonas : Thanks for fitting me in. Just can you give us an update on the Pompano development? And with that, any thoughts on the prospects of sports betting in Florida? Tom Reeg : On the Pompano development, we continue to work through the planning and local zoning. We are racing this season. We are - we have a highlight license that we can move to. There has been litigation around that license. We would like to see if we can resolve that amicably, but you should expect that everything that was - that we've talked about in the past remains on the table. Obviously, I would have hoped it was construction was in earnest - well in earnest at this point. So the timing is not been as quick as we hope, but the opportunity in the plan has not changed. In terms of Florida sports betting, Florida's an interesting plex every year as the legislative session starts, your lobbyists tend to be super optimistic about what they're going to deliver. And then by the end of the session, they say well, we just couldn't get anything done. It's a complex place to negotiate, you've got obviously the Seminoles down there, the commercial casinos, you've got Disney, you've got Miami interests. So I think, like other places the momentum publicly for wanting to be able to bet on sports is no different in Florida than elsewhere, is that enough to break the logjam this year. I would probably bet no, just because that's what Florida has shown me in the past. But I'm hopeful, I'll be surprised. Barry Jonas : Got it. And then just while we're out any thoughts on Texas? Tom Reeg : Texas, that's another state where I'm highly confident there will be significant public interest. Can you get through the legislature there with all the various competing bodies, the odds would be against you given what's happened there historically, but we're working there as well? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Maybe just one question for me. Tom, is it sort of I think as you know in a bunch of different ways, but if I was going to think about it pretty simplistically for the - by the fourth quarter, is it possible to basically get back to historical run rates of revenue in Las Vegas without citywide compression. You've done such a good job on the casino block and clearly got the group piece and that's an in-house number. So not thinking about business travel, but just to be don't have compression in the market. Could you just pace on the mix shift that you've already done kind of get pretty back to what we look like normal without that or do you need the market to go along here? Tom Reeg : Well, I think in terms of EBITDA, not revenue. So I can see of the scenario where we're testing 2019 revenue and the rest of the market has not listed with us. I think that we have the benefit of the rewards program that helps us from our revenues management standpoint. But if pick your property is running at 55% occupancy because groups aren't here, it's unlikely we're going to be running at 96% occupancy, which was the pre-pandemic number. Operator : I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Reeg. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks, everyone. We will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are very pleased with our quarter. 13 of our properties had EBITDA records in Q1, '19 had EBITDA margin records in Q1 and 20 properties had all-time EBITDA records in March, including four of our biggest properties. Turning to Las Vegas, we generated $161 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $172 million of property level EBITDA, excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved [Technical Difficulty] on a quarterly sequential basis. March was our strongest month where we generated approximately $90 million of EBITDA ex-real rent payments and an all-time EBITDA \u2013 EBITDAR margin records of 43%. Total occupancy for Q1 was 63% with weekend at 85% and mid-week at 52%. March total occupancy was 77% and April was 84%. Weekends in Las Vegas are sold out for the foreseeable future. Finally, casino mix as a percentage of our occupancy was approximately 40% during the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of the year. Group and convention room nights on the books for the second half of 2021 versus 2019 are currently pacing up approximately 20% and we're seeing good rate growth as well. 2022 group revenue on the books is pacing up approximately 15%. Caesars Forum for all future periods has booked over 165 events, 1.6 million room nights and $633 million of revenues, 80% of this business is new to Caesars. We're very optimistic regarding the remaining three quarters of the year in Las Vegas and the return of the group and convention business and entertainment offerings that will drive incremental demand to the market. Now turning to our regional markets, operating results improved significantly versus Q4 of 2020 trends. On a year-over-year basis, regional revenues were flat and adjusted EBITDA was up 69%. Looking back to Q1 of 2019, revenues declined 14% and EBITDA \u2013 was 4% resulting in EBITDAR margin gains of approximately 600 basis points. In March of 2021, revenues for the consolidated regional portfolio declined 10% versus 2019 and adjusted EBITDA was up 5%. In our regional non-destination properties in Q1 2021 versus Q1 of 2019 and excluding Lake Charles, which is closed, revenues were down 8%, adjusted. EBITDA was up 16% and adjusted EBITDA margins improved approximately 800 basis points. And finally, in our regional destination properties, we're starting to see encouraging trends for this segment. Adjusted EBITDA for this group of properties on a quarterly sequential basis improved 110% and margins improved 980 basis points. We expect to see continued improvement for these properties throughout the remaining three quarters of the year. I am extremely proud of our operating teams and their execution during the first quarter. The execution coupled with our operating philosophy will continue to lead to sustainable improvements in adjusted EBITDA margin going forward. We're excited about the remainder of the year and look forward to sharing our progress with you on future quarterly earnings calls. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Anthony. Also since we last spoke to you, we closed the William Hill transaction. It took a little longer than we had expected in the court hearing, but we got to the outcome that we wanted and now we control our own destiny and what I continue to believe is an extraordinarily exciting opportunity for the company. And as I get into speaking about it, I want to recognize Joe Asher, who built the William Hill business and we got to know each other well in the original partnership, but as most of you know, you know Joe, you know me, I've done quite a few deals in the time we've been a public company and put together that original partnership and never met until the licensing hearing where it was approved. Joe built a phenomenal business from really very little in the U.S. and we're excited to build on the foundation that he and his team have built as we move forward. As you look at what that combined business did in the quarter, we were about $150 million of revenue. We were positive EBITDA that was despite the limitations of the transaction, where with the UK rules we were kind of frozen in place. William Hill had some lame \u2013 effectively lame duck brands in a number of markets that it didn't make a lot of sense to invest a lot of money in. William Hill with the UK parent and a UK investor mindset that was more conservative toward leverage was not as aggressive as we expect we will be in this business. And so what we needed to move forward really was to take control of our destiny by buying William Hill and to come up with the capital to invest appropriately in the business. And as I get further into results, we'll get to the capital piece but while we were working through the process, William Hill was working on rolling the Liberty platform out in all the jurisdictions where it is not already employed. We expect that to happen for football season. We're going to rebrand our books with Caesars, our app as Caesars Sports and tie our business into our Caesars rewards database. And as I look at what's out there in sports and do the analysis of the numbers that we can see, there's some things that make us optimistic. There's a degree of correlation between spend and market share at this point. Not quite so much for brand or other non-spend categories. That's a good sign for us, when I talk about the cash flow that we're generating right now. If you look at what our friends at MGM Michigan and the quarter where they came from a position similar to where William Hill was to a leadership position in a market where they had a large database that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward. But we understand that we're going to need to invest in this business, both on the tech and the customer acquisition side. And you should expect a significant shift from us as we close the transaction and move forward. The \u2013 and where I want to get \u2013 where I want to move to now is in terms of the quarter we report quarter like we record any other quarter, you report your three months, your total is advancing went through the numbers, but it really doesn't tell the story this quarter. I spoke on the last couple of calls about the demand that we expected was coming and the flow through that we would expect to see, and I'm pleased to report. I can give you some evidence of what's happening in March and April. I'm not going to get in the habit of disclosing a lot about the current month, but what's happening in our business is so different than the narrative that I see out there that I think in this quarter, it makes sense to give you a lot of metrics about what's going on. As we started in the quarter, we had Illinois, Pennsylvania were close. We had significant restrictions across any number of States, including Nevada. We didn't open Nevada even to 50%, until two weeks were left in the quarter. So we saw demand build throughout the quarter as reopening happen. And March EBITDA was almost half of the first quarter number. So that brought us into April. And the fear that's been expressed to me is, there's going to be some sort of diminution in demand as the world reopens. People that were coming to casinos when other options opened up, we're going to go away. And what we said is we think that the segments that are not coming or at the time we're going to come back and swamp, whatever business that we were losing, and that's indeed been the case. If you look at April, obviously these are preliminary results on May 4th; frankly, they tend to typically move up after our preliminary results. But in April, we did over 3$00 million of consolidated EBITDA as a company that was more than 25% ahead of 2019 numbers. Consolidated margin was over 37%. That was 1,000 basis points ahead of 2019. In those numbers, Vegas's table-hall percentage was 9%, which for those of you who followed the industry for awhile is extremely low. Despite that low table hold Vegas has set another record in EBITDA margin for the market at 43.5%. If you adjust for hold in the quarter, Vegas EBITDA margin was almost 47%. Our regional run rate EBITDA is now over $2.5 billion just out of regions. The destination markets, Anthony touched on it a bit has been coming back. As an example, Reno had the third best month it's ever had in April. And I should say when I talk about April, Easter fell in April, it's typically not a great month for the casino business. So these numbers happen during that time. As Anthony touched out, Vegas occupancy was 84%. In April we expect that to increase in May and June. And if you look on a property basis in April, we had 36 properties in our portfolio that were over 40% EBITDA margin. 14 of those were over 50% EBITDA margin, and one was over 60%. And as a result in April at our current run rate, we're generating over a $100 million of free cash flow per month right now. And with that, I'll flip to Bret on our liquidity and capital. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Tom. Given everything that Tom and Anthony just took you through, it should come as no surprise that we will begin to aggressively pay down debt. Over the next 12 months we intend to repay at least $2 billion debt, and that will accelerate as we move into 2020 and look to divest to strip asset. This initial $2 billion of debt repayment assumes a conservative sale price for William Hill's non-U.S. assets with the transaction closing within 12 months. Importantly, this will in no way hamper our ability to continue investing in our brick and mortar portfolio and our sports and online business. With William Hill U.S. now officially folded in, our 2021 calendar year CapEx moves to $400 million to $450 million, excluding spend in Atlantic City and Lake Charles, which are covered by escrow and insurance proceeds. With that I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. And not a guidance guy, but here's a few things I expect will happen as we move forward. Absent a change in the public health situation I would expect us to print a quarter of at least $1 billion of EBITDA in 2021. I'd expect us in 2022 to be at worst below 5 times gross lease adjusted leverage with the reasonable possibility of being below 4 times. On the sports side, I'm not going to make any bold predictions about where we're headed. We're going to put our heads down and do the work right now in front of us. It's all about operating acumen and I'll put our ability to operate against anybody in this business. We feel very, very good about where we're headed. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thanks, everybody for the comments. Tom, just kind of picking up on some of the commentary you made there toward the end. As you think about the demand that you're seeing obviously right now in Las Vegas and in your regional assets and acknowledging the view that you believe, there's still more to come with some of the older demographic coming back and even if some of that younger demographic were to go away, that that gets offset. And you look at kind of the $1 billion a quarter this year that you do expect to print; I'm assuming that's a consolidated after a corporate number, if you want to clarify that. Is there any reason why the organization can't be beyond kind of \u2013 or give away a $4 billion number as soon as 2022? Tom Reeg : So yes, that's a consolidated EBITDA number after corporate, and I would be disappointed if 2022 was less than $4 billion of EBITDA. Carlo Santarelli : Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up right, you talked a little bit about that the contemplation of the $2 billion of debt pay down and the expectation that I think you'd classify as a conservative multiple, but assuming that the transaction does get done. As you think about that the timeline to get that sold and how long it will take to close and stuff. When do you think you realistically have to have a deal in place to kind of get William Hill international buttoned up within the next 12 months? Tom Reeg : Yes. We expect to launch the sale process by the end of this quarter. Announced a buyer in late Q3 or early Q4, and have that closed within 12 months of today. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Hey guys. Tom, you sort of talked about this in general tone. But when you were thinking about the U.S. sports betting market; how specifically do you plan on it on attacking? And when you think about your competition and maybe the guys down the street from you MGM is sort of more likely like you in sports betting or the sports betting opportunity, they are not like you. I mean, are you looking at sort of a similar type of shared objectives as they've talked about, or how do you see this play out for you? I know it's you sort of had been previously constricted in terms of talking with specificity with the integrating William Hill? Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yes. Joe, I liked the hand that guys like us and MGM have to play. We've got \u2013 we have the largest loyalty database in the business by now. We've got a fully immersive experience you've got. In our case a fully vertically integrated tech stack, so, we should be effectively the low cost producer. We should be able to acquire certainly a competitive cost, if not one of the lowest in the business. And we are throwing-off over $100 million a month of free cash flow to invest in this business as aggressively as we need to going forward. So you shouldn't expect us to be just throwing money away to buy market share. You should expect us to build this thoughtfully, but you shouldn't expect to see a significant increase in investment in this side now that we've got all our ducks in a row. Joe Greff : Great. And you touched on this a little bit about asset divestitures and the one non-U.S. asset. Can you update us on your thinking in terms of divesting a strip asset relative to previous commentary given that you're right in that market? Tom Reeg : We remain convinced that it does not make sense for us to market an asset until we can market it off the cash flow that we're doing with it, not a bridge to what we think we can do with it. So that suggests it's a 2022 event from a marketing and sale exercise that closes after licensing post. And I should say I've read a number of more rumors, different flavor this quarter. There are no active discussions on any Las Vegas asset as I sit here today. Joe Greff : So when you were doing $1 billion of consolidated quarterly EBITDA at some point in 2021, is that \u2013 is that sort of the timing of when you would commence? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd look at it, Joe, like Vegas is even in these numbers. That \u2013 what we've seen is the pandemic ended. Well didn't it, we reopened, right? The risk takers showed up everywhere, people they were willing to get out of their house, go in social lines very quickly. That was kind of the 2020 story for the pandemic. In 2021, what we've seen as vaccines have rolled out and numbers have come down, is we've seen a surge in business in the \u2013 I can drive to the casino in my neighborhood. Our revenue and EBITDA numbers in regional are off the charts. We're looking at \u2013 if you look at legacy Eldorado idle assets doing 10%, 15%, 20% more in revenue and 50%, 60% or double in EBITDA versus 2019. What we haven't seen yet, if that wave of demand really reach, if that's coming, and when that comes, that's when we're going to be optimizing what we can print from here. And that's when we'll be thinking about initiating sales process. So what quarter is that? I would say you're probably looking at something that's encapsulated within calendar 2022. Joe Greff : Thank you very much guys. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon everybody. Sorry, can you hear me okay? Tom Reeg : Yes. Shaun Kelley : Good afternoon, everybody. Tom or Bret, just \u2013 I just wanted to kind of ask about the \u2013 some of the sequential flow through that we saw in this quarter. If we're kind of looking at our model correctly, it does look like in both Vegas and in regional's your operating expenses were down. Your revenues are up. I mean, it's pretty potent reaction that you get, and I appreciate you've already sort of given us the answer. So maybe the piece of the test don't matter so much, but just curious, like \u2013 are you just seeing sequential opportunities, is this as contracts roll-off and you saw things that you could do that you couldn't execute last year. Want maybe driving some of that, that just absolute level of efficiency that you saw and see to improve on quarter-on-quarter? Tom Reeg : So, Shaun, I would say, I know that we were the most optimistic people in the universe on what we could do once we closed Caesars. What we have found since we've gotten in is beyond our wildest expectations. And part of that is undeniably pandemic related things that where you could not have possibly moved as quickly as the virus forced you to move, accelerated a lot of savings that we would have eventually captured. We have had tremendous buy-in from the existing Caesar's management team that was here when we took over. The way that we're executing now and the people that we've needed to step up in virtually every function have done it seamlessly. This has been without \u2013 there's nothing close, this has been the best transaction that we ever put together. Shaun Kelley : Great. Maybe just switch gears if you could. Maybe just give us a little bit of sense. You talked about investing in customer acquisition, looking forward and certainly leaning in on the digital opportunity. Tom, you're as aware as anybody is on some of the investments that kind of rack up into the triple figures that some people have made to target market share here. Do you think you can do that in a different way or what sort of the right guideposts to think about within that areas of business? Tom Reeg : I would say that the former William Hill particularly in the last football season, which is really when the spotlight shown for the first time on this space was fighting with an arm behind their back because of the limbo between signing and closing the transaction. You have enough history with us to know that we are disciplined in our deployment of capital, but we are also sober enough to realize we have to invest considerably more than has been invested historically here. We think we can do it in an efficient manner because of all of the advantages that we bring to the table. But like I said, we're going to put our heads down and do it. I'm not going to put a stake in the ground and say, we're going to have this much defensible market share by this date. We are very, very early in this process. We've got a great hand to play, and I have tremendous confidence in our ability to operate and be a leader here and that's what we're setting out to do. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Steve Wieczynski : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Tom, you gave us a ton of numbers, you gave us a ton of data to digest, but I want to clarify a couple of things. So you've always talked about getting to a 40-ish kind of margin over time. And I guess the question is, does that target now seem somewhat conservative. And then that $100 million a month in free cash flow, just trying to understand where you think that could eventually get to? And I guess my question is really just trying to reconcile getting to your original magical $10 a share in free cash flow? And then finally, there was a leveraged targets that you talked about, those are not dependent at all on asset sales. Correct? Tom Reeg : Assets that's not dependent on anything that has not been announced in terms of assets sales. Steve Wieczynski : Plus William Hill. Tom Reeg : Plus William Hill on U.S. So it's not dependent on a strip asset sale or any other brick and mortar asset sale. So, your question on margins since we're already bumping up against 40 without group business, back in Vegas or without full hotels yet midweek, 84% is great, but this is a company that ran what 97%, 98% in a pre-pandemic world. We expect that to come back, that's tremendously high flow through business. So yes; yes, I would say on a consolidated basis, you should at the very least expect that each of Vegas, regional and consolidated ends up in excess of 40%. And that's kind of a function of we came in seeing that business could be done differently here in terms of what you've seen before. And margins could be higher than you've historically seen in this market. And the confluence of factors that we've seen since we got here in particular, the way the team has come together and embraced what we've brought and really built upon it. The expectations for margin are above what we were anticipating when we got here. Bret Yunker : [indiscernible] Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean \u2013 so $10 a share of free cash flow with no debt pay down suggests we need to do, what, four two of EBITDA, I would say, we should be able to do considerably more than that. Steve Wieczynski : That's perfect. Thank you for all the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen : So, thank you. Respect in your earlier comment that you don't want to set a market share target on sports betting or online gambling. Can you help us think about like the time it'll take to build that business? What your expectations are, and like when we should start judging you? Thank you. Tom Reeg : I would expect we will have a competitive business and brand by this coming football season. And we'll be build \u2013 single wallet likely is in the fall, not in time for football season. So there are things that we will add to it that go forward, but we expect to be a player this fall. Thomas Allen : Helpful. And then it's encouraging to hear how you're taking rate in Vegas on weekend. Can you just talk a little bit around the full biggest business including weekdays, like where room rates are trending and how you see the potential pricing power? Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yes. So room rates are still below 2019, both weekday and weekend. And if we recovered just that by just room revenue from an occupancy and rate standpoint in April, it's over $20 million of EBITDA. We're running right now midweek in the 80s. I want to say yesterday would have \u2013 I haven't seen yesterday's numbers, but I suspect they're around 80, and then they climb through the week. And the weekends are full as far as the eye can see, and we're yielding, but we're still on a typical weekend about $20 below on ADR. And that's where the return of group business can really help us in terms of compression because it will both fill in that mid week gap. And those group customers that extend their trip on either end help us yield on weekends as well. Thomas Allen : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from John DeCree with Union Gaming. John DeCree : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Tom, I wanted to talk a little bit about the group business in April. I think we've kind of spoken around this point, but wanted to attack it head on. So in April, I think, you mentioned the whole adjusted margins for Vegas would have been high 40s. I think it was 47% or so. Is it fair to assume that there was very little or no group business in April and that's typically a pretty high margin business? Tom Reeg : Yes. As far as I'm aware, there was one small group during the quarter. John DeCree : And\u2026 Tom Reeg : And you would have that room \u2013 obviously room business and you'd have the banquet business that's high margin as well. And then whatever they do outside of their conference in terms of gaming and F&B. John DeCree : Got it, okay. And historically, how big is international for your Las Vegas business? So, obviously, that's going to take a little longer to recover. We haven't talked about it that much, but when we think about your run rates coming out of April, we've got group business hopefully picking up in the back half. But was there a big piece of international business in Las Vegas for you on a relative basis? And would that be additional opportunity whenever that might come back? Tom Reeg : Relative to our peers, we have far less exposure to that piece of the business, but it would move the needle a little bit when it comes back. John DeCree : Got it. Thanks for all the color. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. Two follow-ups on the digital side. First, you mentioned, I think, in your prepared remarks, investing in tech. So where do you see the biggest holes in the tech stack now? And how do you foresee building or buying this? Tom Reeg : The techs that we feel very good about where the tech stack is the big piece for us there is rolling out Liberty and they've got a mix of Liberty and CBS platforms. In the various states, we want to be Liberty throughout that's the competitive technology, but \u2013 on the tech side, you're constantly going to be adding to it, you're going to be enhancing particularly the experience. So you should expect that that investment pipeline into tech is long tail. Stephen Grambling : And then I guess the other follow up on sports betting, you mentioned being thoughtful about marketing and customer acquisition. Where does content and/or additional media partnerships fit into your strategy? And how you're trying to position Caesars in that kind of convergence of media and betting? Tom Reeg : Yes, I saw that we expanded our partnership with the NFL extended and expanded. That's an important partner for us. Football is clearly the big kahuna in this space and the NFL is where you want to be. The draft comes to Vegas. Next year we'll have a lot of it at Caesars, which will be fun. We were very early telling people. We expect to see continued convergence on media side. We're really the only significant player at this point now that we've bought William Hill that controls everything. We're a one-stop shop. If you're looking to get into this business, we're certainly a logical call and you should expect we will continue to have those discussions. And if there is something that creates more value for us down that road, you should expect us to have there. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I just wanted to start with the regional markets, your comments around March and April trends were certainly very positive on the revenue side. But just wanted to ask about how you're thinking about the outlook over the next six months as more entertainment options will be open to your customers, but that could be largely offset by a big portion of your customer base that currently isn't coming to the property. So just kind of wondering how you're thinking about this calculus at this point. Tom Reeg : I think that similar to my remarks the last couple of quarters, if you're thinking this is a short-term situation, I think you're wrong. I think that this is \u2013 if you think about investment history, you really have to go back to kind of wartime tariffs where the country mobilized for \u2013 in the case of World War I and World War II to win wars. So, they pointed all of the economic capacity \u2013 where the bulk of the economic capacity of the country had military outcomes. In this case, we've spent the last year pointing this at this virus and have made progress on the vaccine front that I never would have imagined was possible. And then we pointed a firehose of money that consumers. So these consumers were at home largely for better \u2013 the better part of a year, not commuting, not spending all the money that you spend going to and from work, eating at work, going out, the savings rate is astronomical relative to historic norms. As the world reopens, already see this capital being unlocked and coming into our doors. We're still early there. So I just don't expect this to change quickly. So I don't spend a lot of time worrying that what happens when you can go to a movie theater or get on a cruise ship. I think the demand for entertainment and just fun after the last 12 to 14 months is going to be like nothing any of us have seen in our lifetime. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Tom. I agree. And then separately just wanted to ask about the William Hill non-U.S. digital business given how strong your core free cash flow was and kind of your path to de-leveraging on the local business. And given that non-U.S. digital business is humming along not at the same growth rate as the U.S., but the UK, Spain, Italy, et cetera, are performing pretty well. Did you consider hanging on to this? And I'm sure you're going to be disciplined around pricing, but we're just getting some questions that maybe the value of this is actually worth more than what you originally thought. So how are you thinking about? Bret, I believe you said the goal is to sell it in the next 12 months, but did you consider hanging on to this just given how everything else has been going? Thank you. Tom Reeg : One of my pet peeves was \u2013 when I was an investor is companies that didn't know what they were good at. And I can't tell you we're good at running a non-U.S. digital business. I can tell you that there are almost certainly people out there that will do it better than us and see opportunity there. And I can deploy that capital into businesses that I know will drive better returns to shareholders. So, no, we've not had a moment's pause in terms of selling the non-U.S. business. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Daniel Adam with Loop Capital Markets. Daniel Adam : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tom, I think, you mentioned lease adjusted leverage with a four handle in 2022 and recognizing that it's not on the near-term radar. But at what point do you start thinking about or maybe even just thinking about, thinking about potentially allocating capital to buybacks or dividend? Tom Reeg : I would say that's down the list for us. We've got \u2013 we have told you, we want to drive this company to an investment grade balance sheet. We want to continue to invest in our properties and we want to make sure we invest adequate capital into sports and online. So that we can build a leadership stake and we think all of that are better uses for our capital than either a share buyback or a dividend for the foreseeable future. Daniel Adam : Okay. Got it. And then is there any way you can maybe quantify how much you think you need to invest in online gaming to get it to where you'd like that business to be over the next say one to two years? And then I guess, related to that, how can you know how much to invest in the business without having a market share target in mind? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. Well, because I don't share it with this group doesn't mean I don't have a market share target. Daniel Adam : That's fair enough. Tom Reeg : And we will \u2013 we closed the deal 10 days ago. So we're \u2013 I wish I thought we would have had a full month's worth under our belt. I'll be able to better answer the question of what I think is the appropriate investment level on our next call as we head into football season. Daniel Adam : Okay, great. Look forward to it. Thanks, Tom. Thanks guys. Tom Reeg : Thanks Dan. Operator : Your next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You've covered a lot with respect to digital gaming, brands, customers, and I think there was some questioning around technology also on the subject of content, right, and that is breadth of wagers that is casino games on the iGaming side. How are you approaching sort of building that out and in particular on the sports betting side with respect to in-game wagering? What's your view on that as an opportunity within sports betting? Tom Reeg : I would tell you we're debating content as we speak, how deep do you need to be in that area? How much do you invest? How would you invest that money? I'd say the jury is out. I see others are moving as we speak. We're evaluating what we do on the content side. What Penn did today in terms or announced today anyway in terms of the ability to develop your own games on the casino side, we think is a smart move and Jay is a brilliant operator, so we would expect nothing less, but you should expect us to be looking to build our own capabilities in terms of building games on the casino side. David Katz : And do you feel as though sports betting wise, wagering offerings, et cetera, you have what you need? Or is that still under evaluation also? Tom Reeg : That will continue to expand and our tech stack is a big piece of that. The ability to build upon the tech platform is really one of the key differences between Liberty and the legacy CBS system that William Hill used. So you should expect that that will be an ongoing living process as we move forward. David Katz : Got it. One last detail if I may. The leverage targets that you discussed in the comments include some proceeds from the non-U.S. William Hill entities, correct? Tom Reeg : Correct. David Katz : Thank you very much. Tom Reeg : Thanks David. Operator : Your next question is from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Matt Chole : Hi, Tom. It's actually Matt Chole filling in for Barry Jonas. I just had two quick questions. Can you think of \u2013 I guess a thing that's come up in recent earnings calls across the broader consumer discretionary space has been hiring issues and wage inflation. And how are you guys thinking about this moving forward? What can you do to fix this? And how should we think about that from a modeling perspective? Tom Reeg : Hiring employees is certainly a challenge across the enterprise. As we sit here today, you know, yes, the supplemental unemployment benefit rolls off. I can't remember when was that? Is that the fall? Anthony Carano : Yeah. Tom Reeg : I think that will be helpful to us. I think you should expect that our labor costs will increase some to make sure that we have adequate staff to meet demand, but that increase will be swamped by the demand that we're seeing. Matt Chole : Got it. And then just for my follow-up question, if you think about \u2013 I am curious to get your thoughts on how the conversation with some of the larger groups has changed through the COVID process as we think about the recovery in Vegas on the group side, how are you thinking about \u2013 I know the timeline to booking window and whatnot they've changed, but how are you guys thinking about it internally? Tom Reeg : Well, we're really thinking about what's the attrition rate going to be for these groups on the books. We think we've modeled that conservatively and early evidence suggests that we were conservative, which suggests groups are eager to return in ways that we were more conservative in terms of modeling three, six months. We feel good about what's coming. You've got Vegas second half of the year is jammed. If you look at forward dates in the market, there is extremely robust demand because you basically set out a year and a half by the time \u2013 the business gets here. So we think that group story is going to be a very good story when the doors open, starting in June. Matt Chole : Awesome. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brian Agnew : Thank you, Boena, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our second quarter 2021 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the period ended June 30, 2021. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements about the company's performance. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, one should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release as well as the risk factors contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars Entertainment undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's call. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure discussed and the reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure can be found on the company's website at investor.caesars.com by selecting the press release regarding the company's 2021 second quarter financial results. Starting with our earnings press release today, we are now breaking out sports and iGaming into our new Caesars Digital segment. This segment includes sports betting, iGaming and poker. And finally, as we mentioned in our press release today, we have divested London Clubs, so starting in the third quarter of this year, our former Managed and International segment will just reflect our managed operations on a pro forma basis. I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. The second quarter of 2021 represented a consolidated EBITDA and EBITDA margin record for the company. Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends accelerated meaningfully versus Q1. We generated $425 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $436 million of property level EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 162% on a quarterly sequential basis. EBITDA margins were 50.9% excluding the real rent payment, up 1,200 basis points versus Q2 of 2019. Total occupancy for Q1 was 89%, with weekend occupancy 99% and mid-week occupancy 85%. We delivered these outstanding Las Vegas segment results despite operating with capacity and social distancing restrictions for the first 2-plus months of the quarter. In addition, we had minimal group business and weak table hold in the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends for the second half of '21 and into 2022. We're expecting groups to start returning to Vegas with each month getting better as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Group and convention revenues on the books for the second half of '21 versus '19 are currently pacing up approximately 18%. 2022 group revenues on the books are pacing up approximately 15%. CAESARS FORUM continues to exceed the original underwriting expectations with over 176 events booked currently representing 1.7 million room nights and $657 million of revenues for all future periods. 76% of this business is brand new to Caesars. Turning to our regional markets. Operating results improved significantly versus Q2 of 2019 with EBITDA growth of 56%, excluding Lake Charles, which remains closed. EBITDA margins in our regional segment were 40.4%, excluding Lake Charles, and expanded 1,280 basis points versus Q2 of '19. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the company. 26 regional properties set all-time quarterly EBITDA records with 31 properties setting all-time EBITDA margin records during the quarter. In our newly disclosed Caesars Digital segment, we generated revenues of $117 million in Q2 of '21. We currently operate sports betting in 17 states plus Washington, D.C., 13 of which offer mobile sports betting. Our apps are now rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook and our new marketing campaign launched August 2. We have now integrated our digital offerings with Caesars Rewards, and our customers can interact with us both online and our physical casinos while earning loyalty rewards. On the development front, construction is well underway on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles. This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the second half of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entrance to Caesars Palace has begun, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience later in the year. In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of 2022. We have come a long way in a short time. Our operating teams are collaborating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. This is leading to continued efficiencies. We believe our margin gains are sustainable, and we'll continue to look for incremental cost savings opportunities. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service during the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the second quarter. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke last quarter and threw out that I'd expect us to hit $1 billion in EBITDA in a quarter in 2021, I wasn't thinking it was going to be second quarter. I was actually thinking it would be this quarter. So we're a little bit ahead of schedule. As you look at the quarter, Anthony touched on some of this, but remember that particularly with mask mandates coming back in Nevada, remember, the Las Vegas numbers that you're looking at included a little over two months of social distancing, restricted occupancy and masks, restricting occupancy in restaurants and on the casino floor plus masks, and we were able to put up the numbers that we put up in the quarter. If you think about drags in the quarter, we held poorly in Las Vegas, the loss from the London Clubs business flowed through in the quarter because we didn't close the transaction until the middle of July and Lake Charles was closed for rebuilding post the hurricane. The drags that I look at in the quarter were about $40 million in aggregate versus what you would expect to see normally. We were 89% occupied in Las Vegas. If you look forward -- if you start in May, May was the best month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars from an EBITDA perspective. June was better than May, and then July was better than June. And I would expect that third quarter occupancy will finish significantly ahead of second quarter's 89%. Brian touched on the way that we're presenting our financials. Now you can see Caesars Digital on its own, you'll be able to measure our progress. I'll talk a little more about that in a moment. You'll be able to see the bricks and mortar business. And now you can see the managed business, which was in that jumble that the historical Caesars used to have of Managed and International and other, but you can see that, that business generates a little over $100 million of annual EBITDA and that will grow when the Southern Indiana transaction closes because we'll get a management fee and licensing stream from the Cherokee tribe at that property. If you look at the bricks-and-mortar business, I touched on Las Vegas. If you look at it on a consolidated basis, as we sit here today, we are run rating well north of $10 a share in free cash flow, significant ramp from June to July. Obviously, we see the same public health situation that you see and there could be bumps along the way in terms of masks and protocols that we need to follow, but the demand is exceedingly strong, and has continued to build. So we feel very good about where we are in the bricks-and-mortar business. On yesterday morning, we launched Caesars Sportsbook. We closed the William Hill transaction a little over 100 days ago, and we have spent -- and that was kind of a standing stock. Because of the rules in the U.K., we really could not do much in terms of preparing for when we would close the transaction, and we wanted to be in position to launch ahead of football season. So what you're going to see is us leaning the entire organization into this vertical. You see the ad campaign with J.B. Smoove, Patton Oswalt, our first national commercial will air during the USA Men's basketball game, Thursday night in the Olympics. You're -- we are activating the entire enterprise. So connecting to Caesars Rewards more than 60 million people tiered levels of service, ability to earn and use points on or offline. We're activating our player development teams across the organization to sign up new accounts; we're activating our entire workforce. Our frontline labor force will each have their own individual QR code, and will be able to sign up customers and be incentivized to help us do that. So this is really a true lean in by this organization that has not happened before. The numbers that you see and that we've generated before have been in this kind of lame duck universe where we had bought Caesars, we had the partnership that needed to be restructured and then we had the time between announcing the William Hill deal and closing it where that -- the business that we were doing was kind of just incidental, not enough real focus. This is truly leaning the whole organization in. And if you -- in terms of how I think about it, I look at this like I look at any business opportunity within the business. I think that we can generate cash-on-cash returns in this business at maturity well in excess of 50% of what we'll invest. But we realize that we're -- we operate in a world that is competitive and that we've got to jump in and compete. So, you should expect us to spend over $1 billion in the next 2.5 years to build our customer base. I can't give you a more precise number because a lot of the acquisition spend is success-based. But I would expect it to be over $1 billion, and I'd expect to, at maturity, be generating at least 50%, possibly approaching 100% of that in EBITDA. And the difference in terms of a bricks-and-mortar investment that -- if I could find a brick-and-mortar investment like that, we would do that every day of the week. The difference is you're going to see that flow through our income statement, which is why it's important that we're able to separate this and show you what does the brick-and-mortar business look like versus what does the digital business look like. But with us free cash flowing in excess of $10 a share, we think we have plenty of capital to invest in this business. We know this is not going to be just a straight line up. We expect that we will make mistakes. We'll have to continue to evolve both from a marketing strategy and a technology strategy, but the tools that we have in our portfolio to prosecute this opportunity, I'm really excited to play this hand and we're just getting started as of yesterday. And with that, I'm going to turn it to Bret to talk about liquidity. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Tom. Our record-setting operating performance in the second quarter generated over $500 million of free cash flow, which, in turn, we applied to retire our remaining convertible debt and make a onetime payment to acquire the license rights for Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas in perpetuity. This combination of debt repayment and license fee buyout results in over $40 million of annualized free cash flow and set the table for further free cash flow benefits from deleveraging and refinancing activity. With investment plans for Caesars Digital now formalized, our 2021 calendar year capex moves to $500 million to $550 million, which includes approximately $100 million for Caesars Digital and acceleration of spend in New Orleans. Net of growth capex, our annual core capex remains approximately $400 million. We commenced the sale process for William Hill's non-U.S. assets in the second quarter and expect to announce the transaction no later than early Q4 of this year. With that, I'll turn it back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. Boena, with that, we'll turn it back to you for question and answers. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. First question, Tom, is for all of you, going back to Las Vegas. If you look at sequential flow-through in Las Vegas, it was about 75%, which is remarkable and just seeing 50% margins on a page is also sort of remarkable. Can you talk about -- is there an operating expense lag relative to revenue recovery? And if there is, is there -- typically with respect to labor, is there a way to quantify that? Tom Reeg : The answer to your first question, Joe, is no, not really. I mean, we're having challenges across the country in terms of filling available positions but to the extent that we sell them, we're also seeing revenue lift. As I said, July was stronger than June, which was stronger than May. So I'd tell you Vegas margins in July were stronger than they were in the second quarter. So I think you should expect us to be in that 50% neighborhood for the foreseeable future. Joe Greff : Great. And then, I think, one thing that stood out to us in the quarter as well, Tom, was digital was positive EBITDA even with the investment. Is there a way that you can sort of think about how the next few quarters -- I know you're trying to build the business, and I heard the level of investment over the next 2.5 years. Do you think you could successfully invest and still be EBITDA positive each and every quarter? Or do you really look at it starting now with the new launch before you reap the benefits of incremental EBITDA that you'll see a little bit of an EBITDA loss before you kind of get to those great returns that you're targeting? Tom Reeg : You should expect digital to be a material EBITDA loser starting this quarter as we -- we're launching -- in addition to all the customer acquisition activity that we intend to do, we're launching a new brand. So you're talking about a nationwide advertising campaign in addition to everything you do, in social. So you're talking about TV, both national and local, and some expensive markets, I would expect to be -- you should expect that $1 billion plus of spend to run through that EBITDA line over the next 2.5 years or so, and it should be front end. You should expect digital to be a material EBITDA loser starting this quarter as we -- we're launching -- in addition to all the customer acquisition activity that we intend to do, we're launching a new brand. So you're talking about a nationwide advertising campaign in addition to everything you do, in social. So you're talking about TV, both national and local, and some expensive markets, I would expect to be -- you should expect that $1 billion plus of spend to run through that EBITDA line over the next 2.5 years or so, and it should be front end lead [ph]. Joe Greff : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Thank you. Tom, kind of a bigger picture question and really just playing on the success you guys are having right now. Obviously, 90% occupancy in July, 89% in the quarter. The EBITDA numbers you're putting out, the margins you're putting out. I guess, Las Vegas as a market has migrated more towards group convention business and whatnot. Has this period made you guys at all think about the go-forward strategy and the use of kind of group and convention type elements to fill rooms just given how strong it is at this point? I mean, you talked about some of the tailwinds, obviously, that you still expect to see coming out of the business. Have you guys thought about at all the way the model is configured in terms of room night mix on a go-forward basis? Tom Reeg : Yes, Carlo, that's a good question. I would say, as you know, we're a company that kind of lets the math dictate what's the correct path to go down. I fully expect that, that convention customer coming back is going to help us in terms of rate compression. And when you see what's missing even running 89% versus what was two years ago, 97%, 98%. It's an extraordinary amount of EBITDA that's left on the table. So I think there's absolutely a significant addition as that group business comes back, it is heartening to see what we can do without that business, though, because in the second quarter, we had very little group business to speak of. Nothing that's even statistically significant, and we're still able to post the best quarter that Caesars had ever posted from an EBITDA perspective. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you. And then if I could just follow up. You talked a little bit about kind of what I think the way I interpreted your comments was a stabilized Caesars Digital business that was doing $500 million to $1 billion of EBITDA at some point in the future. Just holistically, as you think about those numbers, what do you kind of envision as a mix between kind of the iCasino piece versus the sports piece? And how do you think about the 2? Tom Reeg : I mean I think that -- if I'm looking at the current landscape, I think that they -- in the time frame that I'm thinking of, I think they end up fairly evenly split because there's fewer iCasino states available than there are sports. On a per state basis, I think iCasino is considerably more profitable than sports. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you very much. That's helpful. Operator : Your next question is from Barry Jonas of Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Barry Jonas : Thank you. Tom, your comments on July sound incredibly strong, but I just want to be very clear around the increasing cases for COVID and specifically the new Nevada mask mandate. Any impact to the outlook or timing for Vegas recovery, whether that's group, international? Just want to get any color there. Tom Reeg : Yes, Barry, this is all real time, right? The mask mandate came into being less than a week ago. What's going on now with the mask mandate is far less onerous in terms of restrictions that we have dealt with in the last quarter. I don't know what impact that will have ultimately on groups coming back. we had the widely leaked internal memo last week on cancellation rate, which I should hit on that what that measures is a week's worth of reservations. If I get 10,000 reservation and 4,700 cancellations, that's a 47% cancel rent versus what's typically 27%. It's not -- we went from 98% occupancy to 50% occupancy. So we fully expect to remain in the low to mid-90s of occupancy in Vegas through this current situation with the Delta variant. Barry Jonas : Got it. And then just how are you thinking about land-based expansion here? Whether that's Florida? Chicago is always out there. And I know you're starting to do something in Nebraska. Tom Reeg : So I got no interest in Chicago. Florida we already operate in Pompano. We've got a significant joint venture development that's still churning at that site. Nebraska was a unique opportunity in that we have significant operations in Council Bluffs right on the Nebraska border. That would be impacted by Nebraska utilization and doing the Columbus track allows us to participate in sports and online to the extent that we're able to in that state. So for a modest investment in entry into a state where we think we can get a good return out of that investment, that was a very easy decision. Barry Jonas : Perfect. And thank you so much and congrats for winning the billion.. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Barry. Operator : Your next question is from David Katz of Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Look, we've been walking around with a $10 share free cash flow bogey for seemingly quite some time. How do we think about -- given the pieces and the way the table is set now, where it could go from there in some qualitative way? I'm not necessarily asking for a guide. Tom Reeg : So we're still missing group business in Las Vegas. We still see plenty of opportunity in the portfolio in terms of areas where we could tighten up. So if you think about it in broad terms, I've got to do about $4.5 billion of EBITDA out of the bricks-and-mortar business to be $10 a share in free cash flow. I told you that we're significantly in excess of that at the current run rate, and we see further upside from there. Did I lose you, David? David Katz : You did for a moment, and it's much more likely on my side. If I may -- just work from home. So look, if I may follow up, please, with respect to labor, it's been an area we've all been hearing quite a bit about and reading quite a bit about in hospitality and the challenges of engaging people and the costs thereof. Not sure if you've talked much about that, but how do you see that? And we've heard less of a problem in Vegas than other places. But how much of an issue is that in the course of your day? Tom Reeg : I don't think it's less of an issue in Vegas, I think it's an issue everywhere. And I'm sure our friends at MGM will concur tomorrow or later this week. It's difficult to find enough frontline employees and it does impact what you're able to do, and we're behaving as if there isn't some magic date where it's all going to be better. We're hopeful that as unemployment -- supplemental unemployment rolls off that the picture will get better. But we're doing incentives. We're raising wages. We're doing job fairs. We're doing referral bonuses. We're doing everything we can to find as many employees as we possibly can. It's in a regional property. It tends to be easier because you're not hotel dependent. So whether I have 300 hotel rooms open in a regional property versus 175 really doesn't make a huge difference in materiality to my EBITDA. In Las Vegas, that's an entirely different animal. So we are -- our teams in Las Vegas are doing a fantastic job of managing through this, but it's -- there's a lot of stress in the system, and there's times where we've got to pull back on the throttle to make sure that the customer experience endures. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is now open. Steve Wieczynski : Yes, good afternoon guys. Tom, so if I start with the digital side of things. Obviously, we've seen all these sports betting companies out there, and they're spending like crazy to try and gain market share, and now they're going to have new guys out there throwing around a decent amount of money as well. So I guess the question is, what gives you the confidence that the $1 billion spend will eventually turn into $2 billion or some higher number if the competitive environment stays pretty cutthroat at this point? Tom Reeg : Steve, if it turns into $2 billion, we're having a very good experience in terms of gathering customers because away from this initial brand launch, most of what you're doing ends up being success-based as you bring new depositors into the system. And look, my view is this is a unique situation in that you've got a bit of the Wild West where things opened up quickly and everybody is looking for where the customers are. If you look at the companies that have very large databases coming into this or even look at the ones that have been successfully converting smaller databases, it's because they know where the customers are. We've got over the 60 million people in our database. We have the wherewithal to serve the highest-level customer down to the lowest-level customer. We have a well-developed rewards program in place that treats customers to increasing levels of service as their value to us increases. That's all -- that mousetrap has already been built. It's never really been used in the sports business anywhere, a, because you have companies that are off to quick starts here that just don't have that kind of database and that kind of system. And you've got others like us that are kind of just getting our ducks in a row. But I look at it like we can create -- if we lean into this appropriately, we've got 54,000 salespeople in our company that work it with customers every day can open accounts. We have dedicated player development executives that deal with building relationships and expanding those relationships every day and have for decades. We have physical experiences that we can offer and tie into that business that I think position us well ultimately for success. And that's not to say that others are not going to succeed or that our path will be, as I said, just straight up. But I think we've got everything we need to be a success in this space, and we really kicked it off yesterday. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. Thank you for that. And then if we go back to the margin side of things, it seems like you think current margins are pretty sustainable even down the road as the world hopefully goes back to normal. But what's the biggest delta that you guys are seeing today to drive those margins so much higher relative to pre-pandemic times? Is it one or two things? Or is it 100 different things? Or is it just as the businesses were closed down that gave you guys a chance to look at every single thing under the roofs? Or is it -- the previous management teams were just so inept? Tom Reeg : Well, I'll leave the inept comment alone. But everything else that you laid out there is a piece we operate with less labor than we -- than the historical company operated with both at the property and the corporate level. But it's really the attention to detail, the focus on every P&L. I'll give you an example. This quarter, we were cash -- operating income positive in food and beverage for the first time in the history of Caesars. So just on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that's over a $60 million cash swing. So that's $0.25 billion a year. And that's how are you pricing your product? How are you yielding it? How are you managing your labor? How are you managing your marketing? And what are you giving away? It's all sorts of different areas that roll up into big numbers. We're a big company now. So 53 properties if everybody finds $5 million, it's a $0.25 billion. And we have historically been a good company at $5 million bucks. Steve Wieczynski : Okay great. Thanks I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : So as we think about the digital business, as the market matures, customer acquisition is becoming less of a driver in product picks up some of it. You launched your new sportsbook yesterday, the new app. Can you just talk about some of the key features of it? Tom Reeg : Bret, do you want to take that? Bret Yunker : Yes. We encourage you to download and experience it yourself, but it has very deep betting markets. It's very fast, the UX is great. Again, it's going to tie into Caesars Rewards here. And we think it's a best-in-class app looking at funding and withdrawal and the clarity for any sports better. And then you layer on top J.B. Smoove and a great marketing campaign and tie that together not only online but across our brick-and-mortar portfolio, and we like our digital mousetrap. Tom Reeg : Perfect. Thanks Bret. Thomas Allen : And then just a numbers question. So when you announced the William Hill deal in 2020, you said you expected sporting betting and iGaming to deliver $600 million to $700 million of revenue in 2021. Is that still a good baseline? Or how are you thinking about it? Bret Yunker : Thomas, with the rollout of the Caesars Sportsbook yesterday and our new strategy for marketing and investment, I think promos, so net revenue could be below that $600 million to $700 million as we invest in the business. But it doesn't diminish from the long-term growth opportunity at all. But relative to that initial $600 million to $700 million, our attempt to increase and be more competitive in the market could impact that net revenue line this year. Tom Reeg : Yes. That was the business in the -- in the world where it was kind of just wandering in the wilderness without the way to the business behind what's changed yesterday. Bret Yunker : I will say we're $260 million year-to-date. Obviously, we're coming into the seasonally strongest period. So you should see those revenues start to accelerate into the all-important Q3. Thomas Allen : Alright. Thank you all. Operator : Your next question is from John DeCree of CBRE. Your line is now open. John DeCree : Hi to all. Thank you for taking my question. To stick on the digital theme, perhaps a 2-part question, Tom. A lot of the discussion so far today has been on the vast and probably underappreciated opportunity of mining your database and brand, but you also have a lot of other customer acquisition channels that were assembled over the last couple of years between you and the predecessor William Hill. Like ESPN, CBS agreements of daily fantasy stuff. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how those kind of fit into the strategy going forward? And as a tag along to that, if there's other media partnerships, channels, customer channels that you could look at to bolt on going forward? Or if you think you've got everything you need? Tom Reeg : No, you're right, John. We have numerous league and team partnerships plus the ESPN and CBS partnerships that give us access to databases that are certainly extremely interested in whatever team or sport they're following and likely sports betters. And part of what we're doing here in addition to Caesars Rewards, we're leaning into all channels into our own database into the databases of partners that we have transactions with and then out into that Wild West for people that we don't have a relationship with yet. We are looking to build a leader in this space, and we think tying it to everything that we've described should make it an attractive option for players. John DeCree : And kind of the second part, is there other things that you're looking at or potential tuck-in M&A, whether it's additional technology or other avenues that you'll continue to look at going forward? Tom Reeg : The technology will continue to evolve for as long as we're doing this. So if there are areas where a tuck-in acquisition makes sense to advance the ball on the technology side, you should expect we would look at that. If there's some brand or M&A opportunity that allows us to improve our position in customer acquisition, you should expect us to look at that. You've known us a long time. We're looking for how do we drive the most value for our stakeholders. And the answer can change over time. But as we sit here today, we think we've got everything we need to launch with strength and then to add to that over time as we build the business. John DeCree : Very good. Thanks, Tom. And good luck on the rollout. Tom Reeg : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Chad Beynon : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, given your Las Vegas margin success in the quarter of running over 20,000 rooms and a much higher EBITDA result than any of us were expecting, I'm wondering if anything has changed in terms of your thinking of divesting an asset out there and the timing around that. Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd say nothing has changed there. We still expect to sell a Vegas Strip asset, a single asset and I would expect that sale to take place in 2022. Chad Beynon : Great. And then with that cash or, I guess, the near-term cash of selling the U.K. William Hill business, what are your plans with the cash that you have on the balance sheet? You've talked about what the digital vision will cost, but you'll still have some excess cash, particularly given the $10 free cash flow projection. What will you do with that? Tom Reeg : You should expect us to be deleveraging. We want to drive our leverage below 4 times on a gross lease adjusted basis. I see that in the relatively near future for us. And I look at it like -- if you think about something of -- north of $1 billion of investment into sports and online, I think between -- just the proceeds out of the assets that we're going to sell out of -- that came with William Hill, I think that's going to match up pretty nicely with what we need to spend in sports and online to build that business in the U.S. Chad Beynon : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Daniel Adam of Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Adam : Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. For Caesars Digital, it sounds like that segment includes both your retail sports betting business and online. Is that correct? Tom Reeg : That's correct. Daniel Adam : Okay. So can you break out what online-only revenue and EBITDA was in the quarter in that segment? Tom Reeg : No. No, I can't, Dan. Daniel Adam : Okay. And then Tom, I'll take another stab at this, but I'm wondering if you have a long-term target online sports betting and iGaming market share number in mind that you'd be willing to share with us? Tom Reeg : Also no. I would expect us to be a leader in mobile market share among -- certainly among the leaders in both sports and online. Brian Agnew : And Daniel, given that we operate in 13 states mobile and now we've rebranded the Caesars Sportsbook, the bulk of the growth, obviously, for the sports business is going to come online over time and as new states legalize. Daniel Adam : Okay. It make sense. Alright. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Hi good afternoon everyone. I just want to go back to the Vegas environment. Tom, you gave some really great color on sort of your occupancy thoughts. And I was wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing on the rate side of the equation in the past. There's been some volatility there, and it's been competitive. But obviously, what you're seeing now is really different from the consumer. So I was just kind of curious on what you're able to see out in the future and maybe how that trended across the quarter as well. Tom Reeg : Yes. For the past few months, we have seen higher rates occupancy that climbed to equal prior year level. We would expect that to grow further and faster as group business comes back. We're fairly comparable from a rate standpoint over the last, call it, 2.5 months to prior year, a little bit ahead. Shaun Kelley : And historically, we have seen some seasonality in Vegas, but obviously, that's been driven a bit by the group business. I know the booking windows can be short, especially now. But just any thoughts on sort of, let's call it, the fall progression as some people may head back to work and schools may be more back in session, that trade-off in August relative to sort of the upside opportunity as you probably see the group calendar fill in post Labor Day? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'm expecting to be back toward more normal seasonality in Vegas through the rest of the year. I'd expect you'd see the same holiday softness that you typically see on a relative basis, and we'll see what happens in terms of group cadence coming back. But I'd expect we'd be -- certainly in '22, I'd expect kind of a normal year of seasonality in Vegas. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. I've got a couple of follow-up questions on the digital side. I guess, starting with the database. How do you think about the overlap of sports betting customers versus iGaming versus kind of the existing total awards database? Do you have any sense for how much of your total rewards customer base may be overlapping with peers or you may be fishing for a customer who perhaps has even already been caught. Tom Reeg : I don't have any real insight into what's in others' databases, but I'd tell you with the amount of people and ours that, that database has been built over 20 years in mind. I would expect that -- a substantial amount of the gambling customers that everybody is searching for is in our database and has a relationship with us. So giving them an ability to stay home and not look elsewhere is a key piece of what we're doing here. Stephen Grambling : And then perhaps on the regulatory front, I know you mentioned you always follow the math. I guess what's your strategy and willingness to pursue states where taxes and/or license fees are materially higher? Do you need be in those markets to get national scale? Or are there other ways to create value? Tom Reeg : Yes. You're going to look at each state on its own. There's going to be -- I can envision scenarios where there will be states where it's just not economic to participate. I haven't seen one of those yet. So you should expect us to be active everywhere we can be. I -- there are states that you could miss or if it's impossible to make money. But the reality is, if you look at the history of the business in states where the initial tax structure was difficult, there is a history where those have been adjusted. You can't participate in that if you're not involved on the front end. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Tom Reeg : Thank you so much. Stephen Grambling : Thank you. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks, everybody. We'll talk to you again after the third quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. The third quarter of '21 was another strong quarter. We delivered $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA on the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, which represented a quarterly record for our Brick and Mortar properties. 31 of our 51 properties set a record for the highest third quarter EBITDA, while 32 set a record for the highest Q3 EBITDA margin.  Starting with Las Vegas, demand trends remained exceptionally strong through the quarter, leading to an all-time quarterly record of 500 million in adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment. Excluding Rio rent payments, EBITDA improved 44% versus the third quarter of 2019, and margins improved 1400 basis points to 50%.  Total occupancy for Q3 was 89%, with weekend occupancy at 97% and mid-week occupancy 86%. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by booking trends into 2022 and beyond. While group attrition remains higher than normal, we began to see conventions returned to Las Vegas in the third quarter, and the segment represented approximately 10% of occupied room nights, a dramatic improvement versus the first half of 2021.  We continue to expect to see a gradual recovery in the segment leading into next year, and we are encouraged as group and convention revenues on the books for '22 continue to pace nicely ahead of '19. Demand for CAESARS FORUM is exceeding the original underwriting expectations with over 175 events booked currently, representing 1.8 million room nights and over $650 million of revenues for all future periods.  76% of this business is new to Caesars. Turning to our regional markets, operating results remained strong especially in markets not impacted by severe natural disaster events. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding New Orleans, Lake Tahoe, and Lake Charles, increased 35% versus 2019. With margins improving by 860 bits to 38%. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest third quarter EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the regional segment in the history of the Company. In our Caesars Digital segment, we generated over 3 billion of volume, 96 million of net revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of a 164 million. Sports betting and iCasino handle a split roughly 55%/45%. 90% of our handle was from mobile sports betting and iCasino.  We're laser-focused on scaling our digital business through aggressive customer acquisition during our first fall sports season, post-launch of our seasons branded apps in 9 states. While customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, net revenues were negatively impacted by directed promotional investment in odds and profit boost, competitive pricing strategies, and lower than historical hold in certain markets.  We are pleased that our sports betting handle share in the 8 states operating on Liberty platform has increased to 12% through September. Arizona has not reported and therefore not included in these stats. Our national market share through September, including all legalized sports betting states, sits at 17%.  Following the exciting launch of retail sports betting in Louisiana on Sunday, we now offer sports betting in 20 jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile. Importantly, we expect to complete the migration of our legacy up to Washington, D.C., Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Illinois to our Liberty platform in 2022.  We're also excited to be rolling out enhanced iCasino offerings in the fourth quarter, following anticipated regulatory approvals related to the release of new gains in New Jersey, Michigan, and West Virginia. Our expanded game portfolio will be accompanied by significant improvements to our in-app merging technologies. On the development front, we are making great progress on our new land-based facility in Lake Charles.  This significantly upgraded property should be completed and ready for business in the fourth quarter of '22. In New Orleans, construction work has started on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, the remodeling of the entries to Caesars Palace is making great progress, and we look forward to a dramatically improved arrival experience some time in Q1 of '22.  In Indiana, we are well underway with our casino expansion at Indiana Grand, which should be finished by January of '22. And finally, in Atlantic City, our $400 million capital plan is actively moving forward with remodeling room towers and setting the stage for exciting new food and beverage, and entertainment options.  As we look to 2022, we see several tailwinds in our business, and we remain optimistic about further visitation gains as consumers returned to our property once COVID fears have fully subsided. We remain confident in the eventual return the convention customer to Las Vegas and our destination markets.  Lastly, we are excited to rebrand a handful of our properties in 2022, using flagship brands from the Caesars portfolio to even further elevate the customer experience. I am extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and exceptional guest service during the third quarter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everybody. We pre -released for our bond deal in -- earlier in the quarter, so you had 2 months of brick-and-mortar operations, effectively, so I am going to be lighter on comments on brick-and-mortar and go a little deeper into digital. On the brick-and-mortar side, it either didn't hit New Orleans and we didn't have the caldor fire in Tahoe. We had had done a billion one of brick-and-mortar EBITDA in the quarter.  We had an extremely strong quarter. Demand remains particularly robust. In regards to New Orleans and Tahoe, Tahoe has pretty quickly recovered back to above 2019 levels. Not quite as strong as it was pre -fire, but continuing to build. And New Orleans, recall that we have significant operating leverage there that works in both directions.  You've got a minimum guaranteed tax payment to the state and the city in Louisiana. So New Orleans EBITDA continues to trail '19, although it is continuing to recover as well. Going into the storm we were doing $11 million, $12 million a month in EBITDA at New Orleans, and now we're more like 5 or 6 in building.  Vegas had a record quarter, beating the record of the second quarter. So $424 went to $500 of EBITDA, $511 adding back the real ramp payment. As Anthony said, we were 50% margin again, that was in spite of us imposing occupancy caps mid-week, so that we could calibrate supply with our housekeeping services. We are struggling across the country to hire guest room attendants, Vegas is no exception.  So even with the operating caps, we set a quarterly EBITDA record. In October, Vegas had the strongest EBITDA month in the history of Caesars. So the strength has continued into October regionals as well. We're still pacing up in the neighborhood of 40% over '19. So feel very good about the setup going into '22.  Customer demand remains strong. Obviously, the virus numbers have subsided considerably over the past 6 weeks to 8 weeks, and we're seeing some pickup in demand as that rolls through. For digital, I spoke to digital in the second quarter call in terms of what you should expect from us.  We are anticipating investing in the terms of a cumulative EBITDA losses north of a billion dollars into the digital segment, and generating cash-on-cash EBITDA returns at maturity north of 50%. And what we saw in terms of opportunity for us was the ability to activate our 50 plus properties, our 50,000 plus employees, and most importantly, our $65 million strong Caesars Rewards database, and that's what we set out to do.  As I go through these numbers, I'm going to talk about how I look at this business in terms of measuring what we're doing versus expectations. I would -- even though we're extremely encouraged that the numbers that I'm going to be talking about are ahead of our internal expectations as we launch this, it's very early and this is a long game, so we expect it to not be a straight line.  What we anticipated was in states where we offered our Liberty technology, where we were starting on equal footing, and where we had existing strong database, that those would be our most effective markets. And that describes Arizona to a T, which launched during the quarter, has not published results yet, but we think that the results will show us in excess of the handle numbers -- percentage numbers that Anthony described earlier. In the Liberty states in total, and I'm looking at handle because in the current customer acquisition environment, hold is volatile, not just because of the results of the sporting events, but because of the boost in the promotions that you offer. So I'm -- when I talk about share, I'm talking about handle share.  So in our Liberty states, handle share has almost doubled since launch. That's in the 6s to about 12% mobile market share. That's without Arizona. As I said, I'd expect that to exceed the average and bring it higher. Arizona is our second -- our third strongest state behind Nevada and Iowa where we have incumbent advantages and that reflects exactly what we expected.  States where we launched but we were late to the game but did have Liberty, we're seeing continuing -- continued build in market share on the order of the 2 to 500 basis points depending on the market since we launched. Importantly, if you're looking at analysis that looks at market share across the entire U.S. market, realize that we are not competing, for the time being, in Pennsylvania and Illinois which are two of the biggest markets out there. When we launched, the Liberty platform was not approved in either state. It will be approved in the first half of 2022 is our expectation, but we didn't want to spend money guiding customers to an experience that would not be what we wanted to offer them. And so you see our share in those markets sucks, for lack of better term. If you look at where our customers are coming from.  When you're spending like we're spending on advertising and promotion, you're going to get lots and lots of customers that show up at your door. A lot of them are not going to be worth a lot of value. If you look at our customer by count, Caesars Rewards customers are somewhere around 1/3 of our total new deposits since we relaunched. By handle, Caesars Rewards customers are about half of our handle since re-launch.  So validating that we think Caesars built a system over two decades that identified the valuable customers that everyone is out there searching for, we're seeing that in our experience and that's extremely encouraging as we look to the future. The performance in the Arizona also encouraging as we look to states like Louisiana, which just launched retail on Sunday, will launch mobile in the near future. Maryland will come online soon as well.  These are states where we are in a similar position to where we were in Arizona, so we'd expect to perform well. When we show -- when we give you our 17% total market share, that's everything. That's the states we're not doing well in like Pennsylvania and Illinois, that are not Liberty states, but also includes Nevada, which is not a Liberty state but where we have tremendous market share.  We're not adding fantasy numbers in there, we're not adding a horse racing business in there, we're showing you pure sports betting handle. And if you think about what we're doing -- what we did in sports in the quarter, our handle for the third quarter was a little under $1.7 billion -- I'm sorry, a little over $1.7 billion for the full quarter.  In October alone, we did over $1.3 billion of handle. So we think we're continuing to generate momentum. And when I talked about the return on investment, obviously we had a model that showed where we expect it to get in market share and the pace at which we expect it to get there. So you can see from EBITDA loss that it's relatively in line with what we were telling people to expect. But our ramp in market share has exceeded our expectations in terms of its pace. Now, the question to that is, does that mean there's a broader market -- a bigger market share number down the road? And the candid answer is we don't know right now, but what we do know is we are gaining share at a pace stronger than we expected given the investment that we've made. So encouraging results from sports.  In iCasino, if you want to -- if you want to think about somewhere where we have tracked a little bit below plan, we inherited a platform in iCasino that was non-competitive from a game-offering standpoint. And so again, we've not spent money advertising and promoting our iCasino business until we get the approvals we need to offer a broader array of games that's competitive with our peers that are out there. We expect that will take place before the end of this year.  And so then we can talk with more relevance as to what's happening in iCasino. We continue to perform strongly in New Jersey and iCasino, but we have not pushed our launch in iCasino beyond New Jersey today. So in summary, we're extremely encouraged bulk brick-and-mortar, and one thing I should say about wrapping this digital business into the physical enterprise, the employees that have leaned, just done an outstanding job of leaning into this launch for us.  And Caesars Rewards, activating the database, this is not something where you just flip a switch. This is going to continue to build momentum as the quarters pile up. We -- I think we've done a good job of getting our message out there, getting our brand out there, and we're encouraged to see the customers respond. And with that, I'll flip to Bret. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Tom. We had an active third quarter of M&A and Capital markets activity. On September 9th, we announced an agreement to sell the non-U.S. assets of William Hill to 888 Holdings for PS2.2 billion. Following repayment of debt, we will receive net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. We expect this transaction will close during the first quarter of 2022.  On September 10th, we priced $1.2 billion of new unsecured notes at a 4% and 5%, 8% coupon. And we repriced $1.8 billion of CRC Term Loan B at Libor plus 350, a decrease of a 100 bps. Proceeds from the new notes alongside $500 million of cash on hand were used to fully retire $1.7 billion of existing CRC notes.  In late September and October, we continued to use excess cash on hand to permanently repay debt through a $100 million of open market purchases of our existing Aggregate year-to-date debt reduction is approaching $1 billion, which has resulted in approximately $75 million of annualized interest expense savings.  Net proceeds from the sale of William Hill\u2019s non-U.S. business will be applied to debt reduction in the first half of 2022, yielding further interest expense savings and enhance free cash flow. Our 2021 calendar year CapEx spend, excluding Atlantic City, is now $350 million to $400 million, which includes approximately $75 million for Caesars Digital.  This is simply a shift in timing of planned CapEx from 2021 to 2022, driven in part by the hurricane that impacted our New Orleans expansion and COVID-related supply shortages. With that, I'll turn back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. And to talk a little bit about '22, when we closed the Caesars transaction, obviously, we closed into an uncertain environment with a highly leveraged capital structure, and we needed to bridge to the point where we'd be generating a lot of free cash flow to pay down that debt. You heard Bret talked about the beginnings of that in '21. '22 is going to be a massive cash flow generation -- cash generation and deployment year for the Company.  As Bret said, we've got the William Hill asset sale settling between the William Hill non-U.S. business, The Neo games sale, we've got about a $1.5 billion of proceeds to deploy, the bulk of which will be coming in '22. We're generating in the brick-and-mortar business something in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year of free cash flow right now. And so if you're looking from now till -- from end of third quarter to end of '22, you're well over $2 billion of cash there.  We also think this is an opportune time to execute on our strategy of a strip asset sale. So you should expect us to put that in motion in the early part of '22. And if you look at all of -- and as Bret said, you should expect it to be aggressive on the refinancing front in 2022 as well, which should dramatically lower our cost of debt. And so if you add all of those up, we should have well in excess of $5 billion of cash to deploy in 2022. Some of that will be spent in the digital business. Some of that will be spent on capital projects that drive ROI in the portfolio. But the vast majority of that cash is going to go to pay down debt, where we can be in a position to be pushing almost half of our conventional debt off the Balance sheet and ultimately reducing our cash interest expense by the end of '22 to $300 million or $400 million a year less than it was when we closed the transaction.  So we are extraordinarily excited for what's to come in '22, very happy with the results that we're reporting to you today, and happy to answer any questions that you have. Operator, can we open the line for questions? Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from DB. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys, thank you. Tom, I know it hasn't been a long time since you started, but given the few months, so the ramp and relative to your expectations on the sports side, and keeping aside the iCasino side for a second, when do you believe you could start to see that business turn positive in terms of EBITDA contribution? Is it as soon as 2023 or are we looking beyond that and out into '24, '25? Tom Reeg : I am expecting football season of '23. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Great. And then you talked a little bit about the Las Vegas sale and clearly the comps have been -- your patience has seemingly paid off with what you've seen in terms of comps. Is there anything special about the first half of next year or early next year that you guys will get aggressive in terms of looking to make that transaction happen? Tom Reeg : No, it's really a matter of as we discussed, we wanted to be marketing off an EBITDA number that we're generating from the property, not trying to bridge to some number that we've not done before.  Now we've got a track record that we can point to in terms of what the property can generate, and the deck has -- the playing field has been cleared with the Cosmo and Aria trades to where we should have a pretty robust -- we should encounter pretty robust demands for a center strip asset that, frankly, may be one of the last ones to trade for quite some time. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And then if I could, Tom, just one follow-up as it pertains to Las Vegas trends from 2Q to 3Q, more or less. Clearly, business volumes are higher; revenues were up nicely, sequentially. OpEx was also up.  Do you guys think the current OpEx run rate is something that's sustainable on these business volumes or -- I know you talked about staffing and keeping occupancy in check during mid-week to adjust to labor levels, but is the current OpEx environment that you had in the 3Q in Las Vegas specifically, is that a place where you think you can maintain going forward? Tom Reeg : I do, but frankly, I'd like to see OpEx come up some as we fill our, particularly, guestroom attendant positions so that we can unlock the caps on the midweek, and I'd expect that to happen at some point in '22. Carlo Santarelli : Appreciate it, Tom. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good morning, everybody. Tom, maybe we can dovetail into what Carlo was talking about on the sustainability of margins. Was there a big difference between the margin exit rate in Las Vegas in the regional versus what say going into the beginning of the 3Q, excluding weather-impacted areas? Tom Reeg : Can you margin what? Joe Greff : Margin exit rate. Tom Reeg : No. I mean, we were pretty stable throughout the quarter, Joe, and into October. We're still around in 40% consolidated EBITDA margins. Joe Greff : Okay. Great. And then you mentioned by the end of this year, you would have a larger quantum of competitive iCasino games launched, which you've talked about before. Can you talk about what you think the incremental investment is in that part of the billion dollars of cumulative losses and how you think of that as you move sequentially from September and October to the end of the year in digital, more broadly in terms of what that incremental investment might be? Tom Reeg : That was built into the guidance I -- the framework I gave for build of the entire business. As you know, to the extent those are -- the bulk of those, they're third-party games. They're participation from a revenue standpoint, so that was all built in. It's just a question of timing of getting them through the approvals in the various states. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open. Steve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, Tom, you called out that the billion-dollar investment or spend level on digital on your last call and that would last, let's say, 8 quarters to 10 quarters, I think that's what you talked about. I guess the question is, with what you've seen so far in the progress, you've made with market share, are you still comfortable with that all in investment and will that be sufficient?  Or I guess another way I could ask that is, if let's say 2 years down the road, your market share doesn't pan out where you think it's going to be. Could that $1 billion investment eventually turn into a much higher number or at this point, you just don't see that being the case? Tom Reeg : No, I'd say it's the opposite of what you described, Steve. It's -- post launch, the bulk of our spending now is success-based. It's tied to customer acquisition. So if we do worse than we're expecting from a share perspective, I'd expect that the ultimate investment will be less. If we do better than we expected from a share perspective, I'd expect the ultimate investment to be more, but, obviously, the return will fall in both directions. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Understood. And then second question, I think you, Tom, you called out a $5 billion number of cash to deploy next year, and that assumes a Vegas asset sale. I guess the question there is, you've talked about potentially letting go more than 1 asset in Las Vegas. And at this point, is that still the case or is it kind of 1 in 2022 and then go from there, or is there the possibility that you could eventually do more than 1 in 2022? Tom Reeg : Well, with the caveat that as a public Company, every asset is for sale every day, there is some confusion. There were two  in the VT agreements at the clubs. We have never said we expect to sell a second property, nor do we expect to, at this point.  We'd expect to sell a single property and be done, but we'll assess where we are in the market, what our Balance Sheet looks like afterward, and how we feel about our future prospects. But I think it will be limited to one asset. And also just to go back to when I talk about deploying Capital in '22, I think it's going to be well in excess of $5 billion, not $5 billion on the nose. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Perfect. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Thomas Allen : Thanks. I think I heard correctly that you said you did over a billion 7 of sports betting handle the third quarter and then over a billion 3 of handle in October, which based on my numbers implies you've had about 15% U.S. market share in September -- sorry, in the third quarter, and closed at 20% in October. Can you just parse that a little bit?  You re-launched your Sportsbook August 2nd, so how was the trajectory in the third quarter? And then any color of Nevada versus the rest of the states just to kind of get give a view on kind of what the legacy business did versus the newer business? Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yeah. So the -- in terms of handle as you would expect, the quarter built August was considerably bigger than July and September doors to August. Because of the calendar, October is considerably more than September. In terms of the states, I've talked about, the Liberty states.  We went from, in the 6s to about 12, in terms of, handle market share as we are measuring it in total, we're about 17%. Nevada share was flat over that time frame. We obviously have very large share in Nevada, but didn't have any significant move in share. Keep in mind, Nevada is not a Liberty state yet either. Thomas Allen : Perfect. Thanks, Tom. And then just as my follow-up. Can you just talk a little bit -- you gave some color about what's been going well in the cross-sell with the Caesars Rewards customers. But, can you talk about some of the other things, you're $5,000 risk-free bad, the commercials, all of that? How do you think they are doing? Thanks. Tom Reeg : It's hard to parse all of that from a commercial standpoint, they measure unaided brand awareness, and that's through the roof since we started the commercials, basically, ask a question of list sports -- well, list a Company that you know offer sports books. The amount of people -- percentage of people that would name Caesars today is dramatically higher than it was on August 1st. The individual promotions we're constantly tweaking those. I don't really want to, for competitive getting reasons -- get into what's worked the best and what hasn't worked. But you should expect to see that continue. We've rolled out single-game parlay, which in NFL action has been growing substantially as a percentage of our debts. And that's very high whole business. So that's good to see. Bret Yunker : And in the app, I'm sure you track this, Tom, it's just seen a significant improvement on the sports category rank on iOS. I mean, we were trailing -- we were roughly 150 ranked and now we're making great progress between 15 and 20 on the iOS apps, so just a tremendous improvement there. Thomas Allen : All helpful color. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Tom and team, this is . I think Barry might -- Operator : Sir Barry Jonas. Unidentified Analyst : I think Barry might be having technical difficulty. Barry Jonas : Hey. Hey, sorry. Unidentified Analyst : Go ahead, Barry. Barry Jonas : Hey guys, how do you think about ROI in digital markets with higher tax rates like New York? Tom Reeg : Obviously, that's going to influence your reinvestment rate. You're looking for ultimately, what's my return on Capital. But you can enlarge your population states high velocity, high participation. You can conceivably make money at higher tax rates than in lower volume states. But obviously, we prefer the lower tax jurisdictions as an operator. Barry Jonas : Got it. And once you reach a point when you compare back promos for digital, how do you think about the size and profitability of any business loss? And I guess with that, any updated thoughts on a mature market share goal? Tom Reeg : We've not been out there with a market share goal and don't want to start that today other than to make the point again that, the target that we had in mind when we put out the metrics last quarter, we're gaining share much, much quicker than we anticipated as we started out. What was the other piece of that? Brian Agnew : Barry, repeat first -- Barry Jonas : The question was, when you reach a point you can start paring back promos, how do you think about what business stays and what remains? Tom Reeg : As you deposit in our app, you're signing up for Caesars Rewards in the vast majority of cases, if you're not already a customer. So we're bringing new customers into the system. Our expectation is -- our history has been that customer becomes sticky to the brand over time as they realize the benefits of what the rewards program brings them.  So we're looking at it from the standpoint of we think if you're thinking of lifetime value of a customer, We think our lifetime value of a customer is going to compare favorably with our peers, both because of the profile of the average Caesars reward customer that is starting to dominate our handle.  And the length of time that they are going to stick with the app because the relationship with the rewards program. But we do know that we're going to lose some of these guys, whether it's shopping from site to site for what's the best promo I can get tonight. Barry Jonas : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Tom, just thinking about the ramp up in some of the -- let's call it the non-fair fight states. So where you were a little bit later.  Can you talk at a higher level, I need try to give us some direction in a couple of different ways, but could you talk a little bit about how you expect us to be able to monitor -- what you expect to see about the ramp up in some of those really competitive existing states, the New Jersey s, the Pennsylvania\u2019s, the Michigan\u2019s of the world?  Just how should those trends as we see that data coming in every month? And what KPR are you looking for to continue to show success in those markets? Tom Reeg : We're looking at handle share for the time being. And if you want, Michigan went from 3 to over 6. Tennessee went from 2 to almost 8. Virginia went from 6 to 10. So you're seeing it in the states where we jumped in late, that we're gaining share, materially, early on and expect that to -- we'd expect to continue to claw share over time.  So there's really no state I can point to where I'd say we haven't seen the experience since launch that we're building share from where we were. It's just in the case of the states we talked about where we were late, we're starting from a low base, and the claw is going to take more time. Shaun Kelley : And my follow-up would be a little bit on the cost side, see you've obviously been very visible with the national ad buy, but there has been some discussion already, there has been some pullback in the big TV buys. And you've also talked about your performance marketing a little bit.  So can you just talk -- I mean, I'm sure you've got your own competitive plan out there, but how do you think about maybe switching some of that spend through channels as your awareness reaches a level that everybody's going to know you're out there, and you really start to focus on effectiveness. Is there a right timeline to think about for that or do you know -- have you thought about those buckets evolving over time? Tom Reeg : You should expect through this football season, we're going to continue to be aggressive. We just filmed another round what we're calling season 2 of ads that will start rolling out this month. So you're going to -- we're going to be all over the place in terms of media. Where we have kept our powder dry is the advertise -- that media that was targeted toward iCasino until we get the product up to the standard that we want. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pulitzer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ben Pulitzer : Hey, guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Tom, you mentioned this a little bit in terms of the new sign-ups from the Caesars Rewards. Members -- I mean, can you maybe quantify that or put some numbers there, and have you seen these -- to what extent have you seen the new sign-up -- the new players flow into your properties and create more of an omni -channel benefit? Tom Reeg : As I said, the answer to the first question is no, I'm not going to put raw data on those numbers, but figure Caesars Rewards, first-time depositors or been a quarter to a third of our first time deposits. But as far as handle, I've been about half. Those are broadly where we're at. And as I said, as you sign up for the app and deposit, you're prompted to sign up for Caesars Rewards. And we're seeing an extremely high uptake in terms of people signing up for Caesars Rewards, and we're seeing cross visitation.  One of the areas where we're particularly active is the high end of the market, large batters that are new to our system, where we're willing to take large sports bats, and we're seeing those customers make their way into our -- their high -- our high limit rooms as well. So that's been an encouraging sign and we've seen that all the way down to the low levels of the database as well. Ben Pulitzer : Got it. And then just for my follow-up, I think for William Hill in Nevada, I think it's historically had around 30% or so market share for sports betting. Since you guys took full ownership, have you seen any changes in terms of your partners there? I know online is certainly growing a lot as well. Tom Reeg : We're about half of Nevada. Ben Pulitzer : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : Hi, evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the commentary, going over a little on iGaming with the offering not being up to what your standard is. And I think early on you indicated the breadth of games was not what you wanted. From a technology and game engine perspective, are those elements that you're still working on or is it really just a content offering issue primarily? Tom Reeg : We are never stopping work on the nuts and bolts behind both OSB and iGaming. But the iGaming piece that we're waiting on is virtually entirely content at this point. And it's just a matter of getting through the bureaucracy in each state, in terms of getting the games approved on our apps. And this iOS a function of -- this is not states dragging their feet. William Hill, in its former life as a U.K. domiciled and managed Company, didn't provide the resources to the U.S. business to develop both the OSB platform and the iGaming platform to their fullest extent. And so what we're doing is providing the resources and ability to let iGaming catch up with OSB. David Katz : Understood. And with respect to iGaming, there is, I believe, a conventional wisdom that with fewer states and perhaps smaller share or smaller total handle, the profitability and the LTVs of those customers, etc., can be equivalent or even better than OSB. Is that what your expectation is as we start to get some of those handle numbers and see some of those share numbers from you? Tom Reeg : Yeah. We are -- iGaming is and has been a material profit generator in New Jersey for us, and we would expect Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, as we roll out, to follow that same path. David Katz : One last one if I may, which is within sports betting and iGaming, the appearance is that you have a fully integrated control over that enterprise. Is that correct or are there B2B participants in there that maybe driving certain aspects of your sports betting enterprise? Tom Reeg : The only piece is the PAM that's provided by NeoGames but that's a unique arrangement given our ownership interest in NeoGames, where we have a dedicated team that works on only the Caesars ' PAM at NeoGames. David Katz : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : . Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I'll add onto the digital questions. Just one on Canada, specifically Ontario, I know the marketing will be a little bit different up there versus what we're seeing in the U.S.  Can you give us a sense of how you think the market will shake out in any commentary around your rewards program membership up there just given that the customer acquisition will be different than what we're seeing, stateside? Thanks. Tom Reeg : We're watching as you are, as they go through the mechanics of how it will roll out. We anticipate that we will be among the better positioned operators in Ontario given our long management contract history with Caesars Windsor. So we have a large amount of Ontario customers available to us and known to us through Caesars Rewards. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thanks. And Tom, I'm not sure if you or Anthony mentioned this and said in your prepared remarks, but on the regional markets, I know a lot of the recovery has been driven by spend per visit versus visitation. Visitation has certainly been laggard. Can you help us think about if visitation has -- if the recovery has plateaued or if you're still seeing that improve as that 55 and older customer gets comfortable coming back to your properties? Thank you. Tom Reeg : I'd say the story has remained the same that spend per visit continues to be elevated. And I'd expect that to remain the case as long as the U.S. savings rate is about 2x what it's been historically.  We do expect -- if and when you get a full retreat of COVID on the retail side, we do expect that there are significant portions of the database, significant portion of the population that will then be willing to come to the casinos that are not coming today. We also expect that as business travel returns, we'd expect there to be a similar experience of pent up demand for business travel once we've got this behind us. Chad Beynon : Thanks Tom, I appreciate it. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Chad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. These are follow-ups to some of the digital questions earlier. I guess, as you launched iGaming, how are you thinking about who that customer is, and how do we ensure it's truly incremental revenues and profits versus cannibalizing the base? Tom Reeg : Actually, we've got a lot of experience there in New Jersey that's going to be relevant to us in other states. If you think about the states we are going to be rolling out in and we don't have a property in Michigan. We have a single property that's not large in Pennsylvania. We don't have a property in West Virginia, so we don't expect that to be a material factor for us in those days. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. Maybe another follow-up. I know that you gave a little bit of detail about people spending on-device and then in-property. Is there anything else that you can provide in terms of thinking about how  there in terms of greater time on device or step-up in frequency of bets as you've been launching? Thanks. Tom Reeg : It's awfully early to be stating anything definitively in terms of that type of behavior, considering we've really been alive for 60 days here. What I would say is things like digital customers value being invited to brick-and-mortar properties. We're doing a lot of that, and the response has been overwhelming.  That doesn't happen in apps of our peers, so we think, and this is -- as I said earlier, this isn't you just flip a switch. This is you've got to activate this, you get better at it every day and momentum builds. But some of this stuff that we're seeing that's small and kind of neat right now is going to be significant drivers of value going forward. Anybody else, Operator? Operator : There's nobody else in the queue, sir, so this concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tom Reeg. Tom Reeg : Thanks, everybody. Enjoy the holiday season. We'll be back in 2022 with our fourth quarter results. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We have delivered another strong quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, excluding Caesars Digital was $886 million, up 30% versus Q4 of '19 on a same-store basis. Operating results reflect new fourth quarter records for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in both our Las Vegas and Regional segments. 31 of our 52 properties set a record for the highest fourth quarter EBITDA, while 35 set a record for the highest Q4 EBITDA margin. Starting with Las Vegas. Demand trends remained strong throughout the quarter, leading to an all-time fourth quarter record of $494 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 33% versus the fourth quarter of 2019 and margins improved 1,000 basis points to 48%. Total occupancy for Q4 was 86% with weekend occupancy at 94% and midweek occupancy at 83%. Despite an increase in COVID-19 cases in late December and into January, we remain encouraged by booking trends into 2022 and beyond. While group attrition remains elevated, we began to see conventions return to Las Vegas in the back half of '21, and the segment represented approximately 10% of occupied room nights, a dramatic improvement versus the first half of '21. In Q4 '21, we booked a record $160 million of new business in the group segment company-wide. Turning to our Regional markets. Operating results remained strong, especially in markets not impacted by COVID restrictions, construction disruption or property closures. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding New Orleans, Caesars Atlantic City and Lake Charles increased 28% versus 2019, with margins improving by 750 bps to 34%. On a same-store sales basis, we achieved the highest fourth quarter EBITDA and EBITDA margin in the Regional segment in the history of the Company. In our Caesars Digital segment in Q4, we generated $116 million of net revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $305 million. Sports betting and iCasino volume was split roughly 65% and 35%. Approximately 90% of our handle was from mobile sports betting and iCasino. We remain focused on scaling our Digital business through customer acquisition during our first fall sports seasons post launch of our Caesars branded apps in 11 states. Similar to Q3, while customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, net revenues were negatively impacted by promotional investment in odds and profit boost competitive pricing strategies and lower than historical hold in certain markets. Following the launch of mobile sports betting in Louisiana on January 28 and retail sports betting in Washington State on February 10, we now offer sports betting in 22 domestic states and jurisdictions, 16 of which offer mobile wagering. During the fourth quarter and into early 2022, we have rolled out enhanced iCasino offerings, including significant increases in new game content. Customer response to our new game portfolio has been encouraging. We look forward to additional improvements in our offering throughout 2022. On the capital front, we have several new projects underway that will add to our growth profile over the next few years. Construction of our land-based project in Lake Charles is making great progress and remains on schedule for a Q4 opening this year. In New Orleans, construction work continues on our new hotel tower and property upgrades. In Las Vegas, we are excited to announce that we have reopened the dramatically upgraded arrival experience at Caesars Palace. In Pompano, work has started on the new parking garage and casino expansion, which should be complete by year-end. In Indiana, the expansion of our recently rebranded Horseshoe Indianapolis property is now complete, and we expect additional gaming and F&B amenities by the middle of the year. We also anticipate breaking ground on our expansion plans for Harris Hoosier Park in the second quarter of this year. Construction is slated to begin on our Columbus, Nebraska project later this year. And finally, in Atlantic City, our $400 million capital plan is actively moving forward with remodeling room towers and setting the stage for exciting new food and beverage and entertainment options in 2022. The growth projects that I just described, total accumulative $1.3 billion of capital investment, a portion of which will be spent this year, and we expect to generate at least a 15% return on this aggregate capital spend. We have already escrowed the $400 million AC spend into restricted cash, and we have received insurance proceeds for Lake Charles. As we look to the full year 2022, we continue to see strong tailwinds for our business and we remain optimistic about further visitation gains as consumers return to our properties once COVID-19 fears have fully subsided. We remain confident in the eventual return of the convention customer to Las Vegas and our destination markets as well. Lastly, we are excited to be rebranding several additional properties in 2022 using flagship brands like Horseshoe and Harris from the Caesars portfolio to even further elevate the customer experience. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in 2021. I am extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Anthony. Hello, everybody. I would echo Anthony's comments thanking our team members. I'm particularly heartened by the way that the team came together in a very difficult environment post closing the Caesars acquisition. This was our first full year owning Caesars, and we're excited to talk about what we accomplished. I'm going to give you some greater detail behind the larger numbers that Anthony went through on the brick-and-mortar side, and I'm going to talk about what we have said in the past and let you measure how we have performed relative to metrics that we've put out. So speaking about the quarter, we were on track for an all-time record in Vegas until the last two weeks of the quarter when Omicron spiked across the country and kind of knit us in the bud in the last two weeks of the year. Omicron continues to impact us in January. January occupancy was about 75% in Vegas. As Anthony said, we were 86% for the fourth quarter. February month-to-date has ticked up to 80%, and we expect March to be into the mid-80s. All of our forward demand indicators look very strong. In Vegas, Anthony talked about the group business, our measure of cancellations to new bookings, so that number peaked in early January and has been coming down quickly since. So we're set up for -- we've got a good setup in Vegas going forward. Regional, similar story, Omicron clipped the last couple of weeks. If you think about New Orleans and Caesars and Atlantic City that we call out, New Orleans and Caesars Atlantic City, both did a little less than half of the EBITDA that they did in the prior year quarter for different reasons. New Orleans because there's a City of New Orleans vaccine mandate and mask requirement. Competitors of ours that are easily drivable from the city don't have to deal with the restrictions, and we have a minimum tax requirement in New Orleans relative to that license that makes margins difficult as volumes decline. We're building our way out of that. We're hopeful that the restrictions go away post-Mardi Gras, which is what has been indicated by the mayor and prior to the restrictions being imposed, we were doing $12 million a month of EBITDA. So we expect a significant snapback when that opens. Caesars Atlantic City had the bulk of its room product out in the quarter. That's part of the construction program that Anthony described. The bulk of that construction project will be completed by this summer. So all the room remodels, new amenities in Atlantic City should be online for the high season, but that's going to impact our results to construction for the next quarter or so. So that's the current environment. I wanted to go back and look at kind of what we laid out in prior transactions, what we've told the market to expect and give you an update. We don't give you a property-level EBITDA anymore, and I'm not going to get in the habit of doing that. But I think it's instructive and useful as we move to the Digital conversation to talk about how we deliver on numbers that we put out and that we don't take them lightly. So I'm going to take you all the way back to the deal that took us public when we bought MTR Gaming. The only remaining property from that transaction is Scioto Downs. And as we've discussed with many of you multiple times, what we recognized was inefficient marketing subsidization of revenue in the regional space generally. And that's what we found in Scioto. And then as we move down the road and ultimately bought Caesars. We said as we roll out Caesars Rewards into these properties, there's going to be a significant positive impact. And so if you just take Scioto as an example, when we bought it, that asset was doing $45 million of EBITDA at a margin a little over 30%. And in 2021, Scioto did just shy of $115 million of EBITDA at a 46% EBITDA margin. And keep in mind that's in a state where our tax rate is 42%. So a 46% margin and a 42% tax rate stay. Then we went to Reno. We bought out MGM's interest in Reno. That -- those three assets at the time were doing $60 million of EBITDA. We redid all of the rooms at Circus Circus, ultimately all of the rooms at Silver Legacy, spent a fair bit of money. We talked to investors about how we thought we could get that to maybe $90 million or $100 million of EBITDA that would have Caesars Rewards to the property. In 2021, we did just shy of $130 million of EBITDA in Reno at over a 40% EBITDA margin, beating the prior all-time high by about 50%. So then we went down the road to Ohio. And this is where we've finally gotten large enough to where investors were paying attention to what we were doing. So we bought Isle of Capri in 2017. And we said this company is doing $200 million of EBITDA, we think we can generate $30 million of synergies. And we had investors and our peers that were skeptical to say the least, saying that you couldn't find that kind of opportunity in these assets. They've been picked over. Fast forward to last year, again, do the same work that we've done in terms of removing subsidies, removing the corporate expense and rolling in Caesars Rewards into these properties. Since that acquisition, we sold four properties that totaled a little over $60 million of EBITDA. So for us to get to that $35 million of synergies, we'd have to be doing $175 million of EBITDA out of the remaining Isle properties. In '21, those remaining Isle properties did a little over $260 million of EBITDA within our system. Then we went to Elgin. And when we bought Elgin, it was doing $36 million of EBITDA. We bought it for 9x. And we said we think we could -- we think we could get that multiple to 6x through synergies. In 2021, Elgin did $62 million of EBITDA, bringing that multiple down to 5x. And recall, that's in Elgin was closed for the bulk of January last year because of COVID restrictions and faced a competitive opening of Rockford late in the year. And going back to Reno, Reno faced social distancing for the first quarter of last year. So these are results in a year that had headwinds, challenges to navigate, and those are the numbers that we put up. So then we went to Tropicana. Tropicana, we bought, we said we could do $40 million of synergies. And if you look at just one asset in Tropicana, Lumi\u00e8re in Saint Louis, we took that over -- was doing $33 million of EBITDA on a trailing basis when we bought it. In '21, that did $72 million of EBITDA. So Lumi\u00e8re alone was enough to cover all of the synergies that we targeted in the Tropicana transaction. And then, of course, we came to Caesars. And that was obviously the subject of a lot of conversation when we bought Caesars and we said we could find $500 million worth of synergies in Caesars. We had to fight through the skepticism of the Caesars Board at the time. We actually had to go through with the existing management team and have them present our synergy case before the Board ultimately approved the transaction. If you look at what we did with our first year post owning Caesars, first full year, the synergy realization is over $1 billion at this point. The Las Vegas assets had their largest EBITDA year on record in the history of Caesars in a year where there was very little group business, very little entertainment for most of the year and social distancing for the first quarter of the year and masking for the bulk of the year. And then you look at some of the Regional assets. Report -- I'm sorry, Horseshoe Bossier City, we took over, it was doing $37 million of EBITDA. In 2021, it did $72 million of EBITDA. And if you look at Tunica in Mississippi that was doing about $65 million of EBITDA when we took it over, it did over $100 million last year. And so I want you to understand what's in the bigger numbers that are driving our performance. And more importantly, that we put out targets because we know we're going to meet them and exceed them. And the nice thing about this business is this call is being transcribed. Every call we have done with investors has been transcribed. You can look back at every call that we've had look back at all of the predictions that we've made and I think our track record is 100% today. And so that leads me into Digital, where I know the market is struggling. Investors are struggling with. Can this be a profitable business? We've gone from kind of ever increasing bullishness to unlimited bearishness at this point. What we told you was we saw a significant opportunity to acquire customers and grow this business. We think this -- we told you at the time, we think this is the most exciting growth opportunity this space has seen in three decades. We thought we had a significant advantage with our Caesars Rewards database of 65 million people. We told you that we'd expect to lose on a cumulative EBITDA loss basis over $1 billion before we inflected to EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter of 2023, effectively, football season of 2023. We were behind. We were an afterthought in this business. We were buying William Hill last year. So, we effectively set out the first full football season in a number of jurisdictions. So we had ground to make up -- we had the launch an app. We had to launch a brand, and that's what we set out to do. And I would tell you that everything I just laid out in that framework remains in front of us. Nothing has changed. We still expect to lose on a cumulative EBITDA loss basis in excess of $1 billion and generate better than a 50% EBITDA return on that investment at maturity. That has not changed. What has changed is we launched our brand. And we went from that afterthought in the market to, if you look at us through the last month that's been reported in each state that reports sports betting handle, we're 21% of the sports betting market in the United States. And notice I'm not cherry-picking markets. We're I'm doing well and leaving out markets where I'm not. That includes big handle markets like Pennsylvania and Illinois, where we have 1% and 2% market share of handle because we've not rolled out the Liberty brand yet. That has exceeded our expectations. In that original framework, of course, we had market share expectations. We've already exceeded them. So what you're going to see from us as we move forward is you're going to see us moving toward profitability. I'm not going to get into the -- how did this happen at the state level, that's been debated by others for quite some time. What I'd tell you is we have a window into states that are profitable within our own business. And we know the trajectory that they're going to -- that the newly launched states are going to move down. And we are -- you are going to see us dramatically curtail our traditional media spend effective immediately. We have accomplished what we set out to do. We set out to become a significant player, and it's happened significantly quicker than we thought. And I think most of you know me as someone who's not one to spend any money needlessly. So, we've gotten to where we need to be. You're going to see our commercials largely disappear from your screens. You're going to see some that we couldn't -- there's some media spend that we couldn't get out of coming into March madness in a couple of states. But we will largely be off of traditional media other than in new launch states from here and launch dates in both iGaming and sports. So talk about what we've seen. New York was obviously an eventful launch for everyone. The volumes in New York were about 2x what we were anticipating, and our market share was about 2x what we were anticipating as well. So we signed up about 0.5 million customers in New York since we launched. New York is approaching as large as the rest of the business in Caesars Digital combined. And we -- we're extremely pleased with how we came out of the box. But because of the launch of New York and Louisiana in the first quarter, you should anticipate that this current quarter is our peak EBITDA loss that you're never going to see a quarter like this again, that the quarterly loss is going to be larger than it was in fourth quarter. But you're going to see us moving toward profitability and making moves both in traditional media and ultimately through the offers to the customers because we have reached where we want to reach in terms of customer acquisition. If you look at what's happening in Caesars Rewards. So our view was Caesars Rewards was a distinct advantage for us. If you look at numbers, numbers of customers since we've launched, Caesars Rewards represents about 28% in number of the customers that we brought into Caesars Digital. In terms of volume in Caesars Digital, those customers are almost half of the volume of the digital business. So the thesis was we had already identified a lot of the most valuable gamblers that were out there, and our job is to convert them to the Digital business. And that's what we're finding. We also discussed that we expected the Digital business would help us to drive incremental value in the brick-and-mortar business. That we would source customers in digital that would show up in our brick-and-mortar business. And what we've seen to date is extremely encouraging. We have not done a lot of cross-marketing from brick-and-mortar into digital yet, largely because most of our digital customers are very new, particularly if you look at a place like New York that just opened about five weeks ago. In the brick-and-mortar business, if you look at customers that were sourced out of Digital. So either they're brand-new customers in the enterprise or they were dormant Caesars Rewards customers, we're on a run rate of over $150 million of gaming revenue annually out of Digital into brick-and-mortar. That's extremely high volume -- high flow-through revenue, all that comes out is gaming taxes. That doesn't include any spend beyond gaming. So 2/3 of that -- about 70% of that business is sourcing into our destination properties. So if you add assumptions on nongaming spend, we're doing over $200 million a year of revenue that's coming out of digital into brick-and-mortar right now. So that's what makes us excited about what's happening here. We still have work to do in iCasino. We're at 6% national handle share. We've been creeping up as we add additional games. We should have in excess of 350 games on the site by May this year. So we should have a competitive product. You should expect us to roll out Liberty in Pennsylvania and Illinois in '22. And you should expect us to market in those states as we do, but that's a very different launch than somewhere where all the customers are up for grabs. So you're not going to see the expense of the launches that you saw in places like New York, Arizona and Louisiana except for Ohio and Brasilia, Maryland, if they both come online this year. Ontario, I would describe as similar to Pennsylvania and Illinois, where there's been an existing market. It's a great market there. But that's not all the customers are up for grabs. So we couldn't be happier with where we are in Digital in terms of the pace that we've become a meaningful player in the state -- in the space and the ability to start pulling back levers that will move us to profitability as quickly as we can get there. But again, the framework of we would expect cumulative EBITDA losses to be over $1 billion and EBITDA at maturity. So we're talking about 2024 and onward EBITDA should be 50% or greater ROI on that business. And I have the same confidence in those numbers that I added all the numbers I outlined in the previous transactions that we laid out. And so the other thing I want to touch on before I turn to Bret in terms of remainder of this year, we've talked about -- we expect to sell a Vegas Strip asset and launched that process in early '22. You should expect that, that remains the case. There are documents within our VICI agreements on the right of first refusal that they have that govern the timing of that, but you should expect that, that is in motion. And that the next time that we talk to you, we'll be talking about. The next time we talk to you about a strip asset sale, it will be to announce that sale. So with that, we can invest in Digital. We can invest in the projects that Anthony described that are going to generate significant returns in the business, and we can significantly delever this year. We expect to accomplish all of that and we're excited to keep the momentum going in '22. And with that, I'll turn it to Bret. Bret Yunker : Well, as discussed, 2021 was a very exciting year for us in terms of executing on our plan to significantly reduce debt alongside continued investment in our growing brick-and-mortar and digital businesses. We expect to continue to do more of the same in 2022 through announced and anticipated asset sales. Tom just mentioned one. The other includes the sale of William Hill International in the second quarter and generation of strong free cash flow. Our 2022 calendar year CapEx spend, excluding Atlantic City, which is funded through escrowed cash includes $300 million of maintenance CapEx, $100 million of Digital capital, and approximately $700 million related to high ROI project capital. We are modeling minimal cash taxes and approximately $800 million of cash interest expense for 2022, which we expect to reduce through debt repayment and opportunistic refinancing. Turn it back to Tom for the operator. Tom Reeg : Operator, we'll open up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Carlo Santarelli : You spoke earlier about the $1.3 billion of spend and the expected 15% return. So that implies kind of just under $200 million of largely regional EBITDAR. Thinking about like kind of the timing, obviously, there's a lot of projects in there. They all come on at various times. Could you kind of lay out how you to start to see those returns kind of over the next one, two, three years? And when you believe you hit that steady-state $200 million quarterly run rate? Tom Reeg : Yes. So you've got Horseshoe Indianapolis, which is the old Indian brand opened its expansion right around year-end. And so we expect to see the benefits of -- we are seeing the benefits of that in '22, the sister property at Hoosier Park, that expansion should be done by the end of this year. So we expect that benefit to start in '23. We're targeting early fourth quarter for the opening of Lake Charles, which should be -- that's about a $210 million project, something like that, where we expect well in excess of that 15% hurdle rate. And keep in mind that 15% hurdle rate is an extremely conservative estimate on that spend. We've got Atlantic City will -- the bulk of that will come online before this summer, so say, before 4th of July. All of those rooms, the bulk of the restaurant product. There's an entertainment piece with Spigo World that will lag, but the bulk of the Atlantic City spend should be online for this summer. So, we should be seeing that in third quarter and beyond. The Pompano parking garage and casino expansion should come online and begin generating those returns in '23. And then the New Orleans project should be online by '24 ahead of the Super Bowl in '25. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And then just, Tom, I know you specifically said like you don't want to get in to property-level results and you did kind of give that $36 million quarterly run rate for New Orleans and mentioned that it was down more than 50%. So if we assume that, that was kind of a $20 million headwind. Could you kind of give a similar metric for Atlantic City to kind of quantify a similar down 50% off of what that 4Q base would have been year-over-year? Tom Reeg : Caesars was about a $10 million swing. Carlo Santarelli : That was about 10%. Okay. And then lastly, just as you think about kind of the interplay between slowing down the marketing spend. And obviously, the early push, it's understandable. As you move forward, though, how much do you worry about kind of the, I guess, the way to think about it is kind of the volume and GGR handle that's created from kind of marketing spend in the space on just an absolute basis and kind of relative to peers. If you were to start to more or less start to diminish the brand awareness from a public marketing perspective. Tom Reeg : Yes. So keep in mind, Carlo, that what we're largely targeting to start is the traditional media. So you're talking about $0.25 billion worth of spend that we expected that we would have to spend to get to the market share levels that we're already at. The success-based promo spend, you should expect that, that will continue for new customers as you get -- as you convert new customers into, obviously, existing customers as time goes on, the offers become very different and the margin become very different. One thing I should have said on New York, I know there was a lot of focus on our $3,000 deposit match in New York and the thought that, gee, I could just put in $3,000, make a couple of easy bets and withdraw my money. Our average deposit in New York was about $450. So our results in New York were not driven by a lot of $3,000 deposits responding to our offer. It was hundreds of thousands of smaller customers that came to our site. And so you should expect that as you move out of this quarter where you had the biggest launch of all time, you're getting into a period of time where there's far fewer in the way of new launches, and more states should move down the -- dominated by existing customers versus brand-new customers. And the reason that you go after those brand-new customers as avidly, as all of us do is I can tell you within Caesars, when we look at our prior experience in this arena, both in Playtika that predates us, and in mobile states in sports betting. The customer that you find in the first quarter post launch is worth something in the neighborhood of 2x what you find afterward. So there is a method to the madness here in terms of the customers that you're targeting. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Joe Greff : Tom, I know you indicated maybe at the end of your prepared comments about your target of a better than 50% annual EBITDA return at maturity. And then just to kind of clarify, does that -- has that time line changed at all or the time frame in which you look at maturity? Has that altered based on your experiences in these last two quarters? Tom Reeg : No, none of that's changed, Joe. We -- our thesis was, as we discussed, Caesars Rewards was our advantage that this business would consolidate into -- share would consolidate into a handful of leaders. And what's happened is that's all happened quicker than we thought in terms of the share that we've generated. The handle volumes have been in the market generally have been higher than we anticipated. Our share has been higher than we anticipated, but nothing has changed in terms of the timing. And so what we said was if we do better than we're anticipating in share, there might be more investment than what we were talking about 90 days ago. But the reality is the accumulation of that share happens so quickly that we can adjust those traditional media dollars so that we end up in about the same place from a total investment standpoint with considerably more share than we anticipated, which should maturity increase our ultimate returns. Joe Greff : Excellent. And maybe it's too early on the iCasino side. I know you mentioned by the end of May, you'll have that large quantum of games, 350 games or so at that point. But what's your anticipation as you mark up more on the iCasino side, what that does to your bricks-and-mortar business? Does that enhance it? Or does it go the other way? And does it maybe dip into the land-based business? Tom Reeg : So, we've had a double-digit market share in New Jersey for kind of since launch in New Jersey, and we've seen no impact on the brick-and-mortar business. And that's the state where we have the biggest brick-and-mortar presence where iGaming is allowed. We're not active in a physical property in West Virginia. We've got a relatively small property outside of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and we don't have one in Michigan. So, we don't anticipate much in the way of impact on our brick-and-mortar business as we ramp up in iGaming. Joe Greff : Great. And then my final question, obviously, the fourth quarter so far in January, there's been noise from Omicron actually February, you've had some weather in some markets. But when you kind of think about the fourth quarter and the impact from Omicron on margins, excluding New Orleans and Atlantic City and Lake Charles. When you look at the regionals in the Las Vegas Strip in aggregate, was there much of a delta in property-level EBITDA margins, maybe excluding or trying to account for the impact of Omicron? Tom Reeg : That's tough to parse, Joe, given the short time period and the time of the year that it happened. If you want to make a cut what I think. I think Omicron cost us somewhere between $25 million and $50 million in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Steven Wieczynski : Tom, I want to ask about the demand for assets along the strip at this point? It seems based on your comments that demand for those assets remains pretty high. But I guess my question is going to be, if you did sell a moderately-sized strip asset, is there any way for you to help us think about what a sale would do for you guys from a yield perspective across the rest of your strip assets? Tom Reeg : Well, we're 23,000 rooms today. You're taking out the Rio rooms and then you take out a property, depending on which property it is, let's say, 3,000 to 4,000 rooms. So you're going to be down to, call it, 16,000, 17,000 rooms in the market. That's about 1/4 of our existing capacity. So that's clearly going to have an impact in our ability to yield the remaining rooms. Part of it's where do those rooms come out of our system, and you should expect that's going to be a factor in terms of how we decided which one that we would divest. The less we need to rely on OTA business to fill our rooms, the better both from a customer quality perspective and an ultimate profitability perspective and removing the 5,000 or 6,000 rooms from our system while introducing all of those customers that came in through Eldorado should have an extremely positive effect on rates once we're -- once all the deals are closed. Steven Wieczynski : Got you. Very helpful. And then second question, I thought it was interesting to hear the history of all the acquisitions that you guys have made. And as you look back, back at those acquisitions and look at the improvement in the EBITDA generation of these properties. I'm not sure we're going to be able to do this. But is there any way you can help us think about how much of those EBITDA improvements are directly the result of total rewards being incorporated versus just the assets were being poorly run before and that's no disrespect to some of your counterparts, but I hope that makes sense. Just trying to parse out how much total rewards drives that versus what you guys have done? Tom Reeg : That's another one that's hard to answer, Steve. I'm glad you like those comments because it started to feel a little like a rant as I went on and on there. But the -- what I would say is the bulk of what is -- the bulk of what's been generated is removing the marketing to everyone and targeting your most profitable customers, and that sounds simple. But as you know, that was not a particular strength of our industry until relatively recently. And that's the biggest impact and that's another -- that's to get back on the Digital soapbox for it, that's the same problem that faces us in digital that we need to solve. Right now, we're marketing to the entire world that's going to stop, and we're going to start marketing to the most profitable customers. But if you think about food and beverage, Steve, which was where a lot of that marketing took place, right? It was comped, food and beverage. If you look at the Caesars Enterprise in 2019, the combined Caesars, so including the Eldorado side, lost on a cash basis over $200 million in food and beverage. In 2021, we were cash positive EBITDA in Food and Beverage, so about $0.25 billion swing just in that line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. You may proceed with your question. Barry Jonas : Tom, any interest in the New York land-based casino here, and I guess, with that, any other land-based markets you're exploring? Tom Reeg : So in New York, how do I answer this politely, New York is a difficult regulatory state. I think it's going to be extremely expensive to build there. I think it's going to be an extremely expensive license fee. And I think there's a likelihood that you're going to have to solve some other problem of the city in addition to creating the jobs that you do in building a casino. So it's not going to be enough to pick a site, build a casino, create the jobs and generate a return. There's going to have to be other investment there as well. So I would say, on our balance sheet, it's extraordinarily unlikely that we make a material investment into New York land based. Now there are others that take a different view in terms of the investment opportunity there for a variety of reasons. If one of those developers wants to talk to a manager that brings 65 million reward members and powerful brands, we'd be very interested in having that discussion. Away from New York, we're doing the Columbus, Nebraska project, which is fairly small track in the middle of the state that helps us get into digital in that state as well. There are other states that are kicking around the possibility that might be interesting, but it's unlikely that greenfield new license activity becomes a huge driver of value or a huge suck of our time from Caesars standpoint. Barry Jonas : I guess, just to close the loop, gaming, now legal apparently in the UAE. Any chance we could see gaming at your property in Dubai? Tom Reeg : Well, that was the original thought when Caesars struck that deal in Dubai that maybe ultimately the UAE would have gaming that is a Caesars Palace in Dubai that we manage. So if there's an opportunity, you should expect that we would be active and our brand and building is already open. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Shaun Kelley : Tom, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on New York on the digital side and maybe just get your take on sort of how did the market play out as you got into the cadence of sort of the opening period here? We saw -- I think the promotional environment, the offers that we saw are probably not that different than what we've seen in other markets. But obviously, seems like just the magnitude a number of customers was pretty dramatic. So, I just want to get your sense on how did that play relative to your expectation? And maybe does it require a substantially larger investment than you originally outlayed just given that market is deeper than perhaps you thought initially? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Holland I characterize when I was a kid we used to drink out of the garden hose when we're off plan outside. It was as if you were get ready to drink from a garden hose in a title wave came and hit you. It was absolutely staggering the demand in New York. To give you an idea, we had 75,000 inquiries to our customer service portals in the first two days post launch in New York. As I said, it was 2x what we were expecting in terms of volume and our share was 2x of what we were expecting of that volume. In terms of the ultimate -- yes, we have more market share than we anticipated in New York. So the cost of that launch is more than we had originally modeled. But that's also part of the reason that we can start to cut back on traditional media immediately and end up in about the same place, except with much more share than we anticipate. Shaun Kelley : Great. And then maybe sort of the corollary to that, if you can help us think through the revenue side of how this may play out over the next couple of quarters. When I look at digital revenue in this reported quarter, I think it's actually down a little bit year-over-year and a lot of that probably has to do with promo timing. But just help us think about how revenues are going to come in, especially when you have a couple of these big market launches, New York in this quarter, Canada likely in next quarter before we start to maybe see some of that promo roll off, we actually start to see your success on the net revenue side? Tom Reeg : Yes. This quarter, we'll look at the New York and Louisiana launches are both in there. New York, the way that they account for promos as they hit before the net -- between gross revenue and net revenue. So we'll take you through off-line in terms of how that flows through the financials. But you're going to see significant hits to net revenue from the New York launch in this quarter. It doesn't change the overall EBITDA number, but the way that it flows through the income statement is unique. But as you get out of this quarter, when we go into Pennsylvania and Illinois with Liberty, those will be much more modest launches in terms of costs and promo. Those are existing markets where we're going to have to call our share kind of 100 basis points at a time. So you're not going to see that dramatic day one impact that you saw in New York, Arizona, Louisiana. Same thing with Ontario iGaming, you won't see something that looks like those last three states I mentioned until Ohio and or Maryland come on, which sound like later this second half of the year is the tentative schedule there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. You may proceed with your question. David Katz : I wanted to ask about the Las Vegas Strip. And I know it's not the most normal environs, but there's really yourselves and one other pretty large player that arguably are quite different, but still the biggest players on the same block. Can you help us think about the degree to which -- and I hesitate to use the word, share shifts, but your successes are necessarily their failures and vice versa? Or can you both succeed concurrently? Like how do we think about those puts and takes in this environment? Tom Reeg : I like that question, David, because I wanted to talk about this in both digital and land. As the Vegas question, I want everybody to do well in Las Vegas. I don't view the way that we do well is MGM or when -- or Venetian doesn't do well. This market is -- everybody is going to have a good '22 and '23 as the group business comes back. And sure, we fight over customers, we fight over entertainers in terms of normal competitive atmosphere. But MGM as an example, I'm incredibly impressed with what Bill and his team have done at MGM. And it's great to see them get recognized for it in share price And I expect them to continue to succeed as I expect us to continue to succeed. And flipping that into Digital, our ability to succeed from here in my view, is dependent on our ability to do the blocking and tackling to target those valuable customers and service them and roll and melt that business into Caesars Rewards and into our larger brick-and-mortar business. Our business does not depend on somebody else failing or somebody else running out of money. There is enough room in this space for multiple success stories. I would say at least three or four, we intend to be one of them, but we don't need anybody else to fail in Vegas or outside Vegas for us to succeed. David Katz : Perfect. And if I can follow up quickly, when we last saw each other in person, which was G2E and we talked about the Strip asset sale, I recall the perspective that time has been your ally. Would you say that it's still been your ally since then to now? Pardon the question, we have to be anxious about something in this job. So how we're doing there? Tom Reeg : I'd say no question. We're -- obviously, we had a first quarter last year in Vegas, that had significant restrictions on sensing masking. It was a difficult operating environment. And as we market this asset, we're going to be able to market off a 12-month period that while it was not without impact from COVID, it was a very different cash flow picture than the heavily COVID-impacted times. And then if you look at the last two trades that I've seen in the kind of the PropCo OpCo space was Craig's Trade in Boston and Bill's Trade Opco at Mirage, both of which are exceedingly good comps for anyone who wants to market a Center Strip asset. So we feel like waiting to pursue this now was the right decision, and we're excited about where we can get here. If you recall, we only paid $17 billion for Caesars. I told you the synergy number. So with those synergies, we bought Caesars for less than 6x EBITDA. And the Vegas asset sale is going to bring back 15% plus of those proceeds most likely back onto our balance sheet. So we couldn't be more pleased with the position we're in terms of selling the Strip asset. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question. Dan Politzer : I just wanted to touch on regionals really quickly. Can you just give us an update? Are you seeing any properties or regions of pockets part of promotions? And I guess outside of Rockford and Omaha, maybe one or two other markets. Can you just remind us where we should be thinking about new competition coming online? And then just one other along those lines, just any update on February trends to date. Tom Reeg : Okay. In terms of the promotional environment, I'd say there's nothing to call out that would be material to our outlook as a company. In terms of competitive openings, Rockford is temporary. You'll have Omaha temporaries presumably at some point in '22. We're working through, obviously, the Monarch addition in Colorado, but I should have hit on that one when I was talking about property performance, we took that property over doing $35 million or so in EBITDA. It did over $60 million last year in the face of Monarch opening across the street. And Monarch property is beautiful. So competitive opening is not necessarily the impact that you might expect. You had Spectacle opened their property in Gary on the interstate last year. Hammonds has held in exceedingly well since we -- since that opened, actually flat to up in EBITDA. Anything else you can think of that's going to open? Anthony Carano : No. Tom Reeg : That's all I can take it in terms of February and February has been stronger than January. As I said, we were 75% occupied in Vegas in January, 80% month-to-date in February for looks strong as well. Super Bowl was really, really good and President's Day weekend was really, really good as well. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just one on the Strip. You talked about margins kind of in that 50-ish percent level and group and convention coming back maybe later in the year. I mean, how should we think about -- is that still fair to kind of think about it as kind of a normalized run rate going forward? Or are you kind of -- are you managing this to grow EBITDA in absolute levels like some of your peers? Tom Reeg : Well, I think you're going to see both. This quarter, if you treat the real lease, like you treat all the other leases, we were 48% margin in a seasonal low quarter. So, I'd say high-40s to low-50s kind of straddling 50, is based on seasonality is a good expectation. And we just don't have -- the business that comes back for us with group business helps us in terms of rate compression. So hotel margin and also brings back a banquet business for us that's in excess of the overall Vegas margin. So we think it's accretive to EBITDA and margins as it comes back for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. You may proceed with your question. John DeCree : Maybe a two-part question, Tom, and I appreciate the trip down memory lane that you took us earlier and all the success you've had in regional gaming M&A. So I wanted to ask if that strategy could be part of Caesars future. I realize there's a lot less white space today, but given the success. And I ask in the context of looking into 2023 when the CapEx that you have currently starts to wind down, EBITDA and Digital and flex, the balance sheet should be delivered, and as Bret talked about some opportunistic refinancing ahead, lots of free cash flow in our model. How do you think about deploying that middle of 2023, not that far away? And if regional gaming M&A could be a part of that strategy? Tom Reeg : So I'd say it does seem to be a core competency of ours in terms of squeezing more cash flow out of assets that have been owned by others. So we recognize that. Obviously, it becomes tougher from an antitrust perspective, the larger that you get -- so that would certainly be a consideration. But I'd also say until we inflect to EBITDA positive in digital, I don't anticipate any material buy side M&A from us. John DeCree : Fair enough. And would the same comment hold true for other uses of capital as we approach the fourth quarter of next year, given the free cash that your portfolio is generating? Tom Reeg : It's hard to project that far in the future on that question. Obviously, it's going to depend on what does the valuation look like? If I'm still getting negative $15 a share for Digital, maybe I become a buyer of my stock, but I would expect that we'll have corrected that at that time. And we'll see how the stock behaves. We'll see how it performs as we delever. I think that's going to be multiple enhancing. But by the time frame that you're laying out, we'll know that answer and be better informed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. You may proceed with your question. Chad Beynon : Two on Digital. One, as you continue to come through the data, Tom, you talked about inflection in Q4 '23. Wondering if the 30% to 35% long term EBITDA margin still holds up in your view? And then secondly, some of the other companies have expanded their digital offerings to marketplace and NFTs, and that seems like a pretty high-margin business to just offer your users. Is that something that you would consider exploring just as your DAUs and MAUs grow? Tom Reeg : So Chad, on the second question, I would say absolutely not. I'll tell you what's a high flow-through business and high-margin business. It's the Casino business. And that's what we operate outside of Digital, and we think it's an extremely strong complement to the Digital business. The first quite is the first to two factors. Anthony Carano : Yes. So I mean... Tom Reeg : And I appreciate that question, Chad. Answer the short answer is no. And I think that's -- there is a -- I think there's a mistake that's made in the investor community that conflates a low hold business with a low margin business. We know of states in our portfolio where we've got strong market share in mobile, where we can operate mobile sports betting well in excess of 50% EBITDA margin. And that's going to mix with other states, which for either competitive or regulatory reasons, the margin is going to be different. But this is a 5%, 6%, 7% hold business. If you think about the Regional Gaming business, a lot of that business is video poker business and hold on video poker games is 3%, 4%, 5%. And we run margins in those properties of 40% to 45%, 50% with the full operating cost of a physical property. So we're extremely bullish on what we'll ultimately be able to do margin-wise in digital, but that will evidence itself as you get out of this launch period and your customers are dominated by existing customers versus brand-new customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bain with B. Riley. You may proceed with your question. David Bain : Great. Very helpful commentary and transparency. We agree the balance sheet activity is a near-term catalyst for valuation. And kind of just hoping maybe, Tom, you could big picture the balance sheet playbook that captures the William Hill proceeds, the forward strip asset sale, free cash flow from operations, interest savings. Is there a net leverage kind of target or expectation by the end of next year when you funnel those items in? Tom Reeg : Yes. So we have the entire -- the bulk of the capital structure that we would want the debt structure, we want a target is available to us by the middle of this year. Our unsecured debt in the current environment trades, what, 5.25%, 5.5%? So that's our most expensive debt, the secured debt trades cheaper than that. Bret laid out what we're spending in interest expense. We think there's considerable opportunity to reduce our interest expense. We're at about $22 billion, $23 billion of gross lease adjusted leverage. We're generating as a cost in the neighborhood of $2 billion of brick-and-mortar free cash flow. You know what's coming in from the William Hill transaction, and you can make your own assumption on what Vegas assets Strip -- our Vegas Strip asset sale would bring and then we'll spend some in terms of investment into Digital. But you could see us certainly within the next 18 months or so kind of somewhere in the mid- to high teens in terms of outstanding lease-adjusted debt and our leverage would be somewhere in the 4s when we inflect to positive in Digital when it would start to come down considerably. So you could see leverage get to relatively low levels pretty quickly, certainly in the next 18 to 24 months. David Bain : Okay. Great. Understand. And then just lastly, when looking at news impacting the stock market, including today, and the overall patron economic setup this year with indirect stimulus versus direct last year. How should we view the kind of the macro setup overall, understanding there's specific catalysts that you mentioned like conventions coming and the older demographic coming back. But just if you could big picture that as well, that would be helpful. Tom Reeg : Yes, I'd say our business, not just our business, then since reopening has been highly correlated to both the COVID case counts and the coverage of COVID in general. When the coverage leads to fear we see reduction in business. And when you get to where we appear to be getting to with Omicron, we tend to see pent-up demand. We see no reason that, that would be a different scenario this time. The household savings rate is still at extraordinarily high levels relative to history. The Fed obviously has a big job in front of them in terms of managing inflation as we move forward and what they do with rates. And that's obviously an exogenous effect that could impact wealth effect if they make a move that the markets don't like, but we feel generally very positive with where our consumer is. That 55-plus customer is still not back in anywhere near the levels of the younger crowd, and that historically has been a key driver of business both in destination markets and regional. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Reeg for any further remarks. Tom Reeg : Thanks, guys. That's all we got. We'll talk to you after first quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I will turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you Brian and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We delivered another strong quarter to start the year in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, with $850 million up over 60% versus the first quarter last year. Margins in our brick-and-mortar business were 36.2% despite the negative impacts of Omicron in January. Operating results reflect the new first quarter record for adjusted EBITDA in our Las Vegas segment despite multiple headwinds during the quarter. In total, 18 of our property set a record for the highest first quarter EBTITDA while 28 set a record for the highest Q1 EBITDA margin. Turning to Las Vegas, demand trends strengthened throughout the quarter, leading to an all-time first quarter record of $411 million and adjusted EBITDA excluding real rent payments. EBITDA improved 140% versus the first quarter of 2021 and margins improved 1000 basis points to 45%. Total occupancy for Q1 was 83% with weakened occupancy at 95% and midweek at 77%. As of April 01 2022, we lifted all occupancy caps in Las Vegas, and would expect to see a material improvement occupancy for the second quarter of 2022. Group room nights during Q1 represented approximately 13% of occupied room nights in Las Vegas, up from 11% in the second half of 2021 despite January weakness to Omicron. Elevated attrition rates continue to decline and group revenue pace in Las Vegas is strong for the remainder of the year and into \u201823 and \u201824. With convention demand accelerating, we are excited to finally see the full potential of the new Caesars Forum Convention Center. Forum currently has 150 future events booked with over 1.3 million room nights and over 500 million in revenue. Over 70% of this contracted business is new to Caesars as a company. In our regional markets, operating results remain strong and revenues and EBITDA improve sequentially each month of the quarter. Trends have further improved into April. EBITDA for the first quarter was $459 million with margins of 33.6%. Highlighting a few specific properties, trends normalized in New Orleans in Q1 following the removal of masks and vaccine mandates in March, and Atlantic City had a great quarter despite it still having room\u2019s offline for remodeling. We are encouraged by the early returns on the capital spend at the recently rebranded Horseshoe Indianapolis and look forward to starting construction on our Harrah's Hoosier Park expansion this year. Following the launch of Sports betting and iCasino in Ontario on April 4, we now offer sports betting in a combination of 24 domestic States and North American jurisdictions, 17 of which are offered mobile wagering. In March, we converted Illinois to our Liberty platform and expect all of our remaining Caesars branded apps and sports books to be running Liberty by year end 2022. We remain focused on growing our digital business during Q1 through customer acquisition, especially in new markets, including New York and Louisiana. While customer acquisition and handle exceeded our internal expectations, especially in New York and Louisiana, net revenues were negatively impacted by promotional investment to support the new market launches. Our capital program remains unchanged from our Q4 call. We're excited to have most of our room remodels completed in Atlantic City for the upcoming summer season and look forward to many new food and beverage and entertainment offerings this fall. Our new land based facility in Lake Charles remains on track to open in Q4 of this year, and so does our casino expansion and new parking garage in Pompano. We anticipate breaking ground on our expansion plans for Harrah's Hoosier Park this quarter, and construction is slated to begin on our Columbus Nebraska project later this year. These are exciting projects which will collectively generate a meaningful economic contribution for our company. As we look to the remainder of \u201822 we remain optimistic about our business as consumer trends remain strong. We're also encouraged regarding improving group and convention trends in Las Vegas, as well as the potential for the full recovery of our older demographic consumer who has been the most impacted to COVID-19. In addition, our property rebrands are exceeding return expectations, which gives us confidence in future announced rebranding opportunities in St. Louis, Black Hawk, Las Vegas and Florida. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in 2022 so far. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom for some additional insights on the quarter. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Anthony. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I echo Anthony's comments on the work that our employees have done to drive results for the organization personally, this, it now feels like what we thought we were buying when we originally bought, we bought Caesars Entertainment, we're almost two years in now. But with all the virus disruptions that went on over those two years, it's really the last eight weeks or so that we're starting to hit on all cylinders, and really feel the potential of the organization. So we talked to you in well into the first quarter. And what we described then was Omicron was kind of a wet blanket around the entire business. For the bulk of January into February, it was really right before the Super Bowl that events changed with the virus and we saw a surge in visitation. This is --and you'll hear a common theme. As I go through, I know that investors are extremely concerned with the health of the consumer and what's going on inflation wise, what impact is that having on the business. I can say unequivocally that the biggest correlation that we see in the business over the last two years is the state of the virus. And then when the virus receives and case counts are benign, there is a pent up demand for travel and entertainment activity. And we see a burst of demand in our business that was Omicron was no exception. So as you got through Omicron, if you look at the regional market, as Anthony discussed, we ended up considerably year-over-year, margins in the 33 plus percent range. If you think about that in the quarter, and this is true throughout when volumes are down, we experienced negative operating leverage, so regional margins in January were 29%. In March, they were above 37%. So we ramped up through the quarter as demand increased. And that has continued into April into the second quarter with margins in excess of 37% on a preliminary basis, in April and volumes remaining strong. So obviously we have a tough comp second quarter in regional, but we have been holding up particularly well as we've gone through April. In Las Vegas, if you look at from an occupancy standpoint, we had told you before January was around 75% occupancy. February was about 80% came in about 81%. We thought that March would come in in the mid-80s. It actually came in at 91% for the month. And so we were able to have a record first quarter, even with a slow start where we lost the bulk of CES which is one of the biggest group groups on the calendar market wide. And if you think about margins in Las Vegas, we were a little over 40.5% in January, in March we were a little over 47%. The strength has continued into April. April was the single largest month in the history of the Caesars organization for cash room revenue. Occupancy was just under 97%. Rates were up a little less than 40% over last year last April at a little less than 20% over \u201819. So Vegas is extraordinarily strong for us. As we as we sit here today, I expect us to break the record again in May for cash hotel revenue, second quarter is going to be particularly strong in the group business. This is where a lot of the cancellations post pandemic started to rebook into. So we expect a significant bump in group business. Recall that when we talk about group business, we did not have Caesars in \u201819 did not have the Forum Convention Center operating. So when we say group will be considerably stronger than \u201819, that includes the Forum \u201819 did not. But we'd expect Vegas to continue a very strong trajectory, as I said, April all time, room cash room revenue record, despite only 30 days and Easter holiday in April, which is not a particularly good casino holiday, May have 31 days should be even better. So feel very good about where the brick-and-mortar business is heading. As you look at digital, let me I'm sorry, before I go to digital I spoke in artfully on the last conference call about timing of the Vegas asset sale, I want to be very clear. We started the process to sell a Las Vegas Strip asset early in \u201822. There are public documents that show you how long the ROFR process and the process to reach a definitive agreement. Last, which would put us somewhere in the middle of summer for a consummation of a transaction, you shouldn't expect us to be giving you play by play in the interim will be back to you, when that's resolved know that it is in motion and governed by the documents that we that govern our VICI agreement. As you go to digital, as I said on the fourth quarter call first quarter is our peak EBITDA loss. Of the 553 of EBITDA loss in the quarter, a little over $400 million is attributable to the launches in New York and Louisiana with New York, the lion's share of that. As discussed, we got to our handle share goals far earlier than we anticipated. And we did to cut back all of our mass media spend. So we cut about a little over a quarter of a billion dollars of expected spend from when we started cutting in February, through the end of this year, we've seen no degradation in handle share, other than our planned retrenchment in New York back through as we talked about, we were more aggressive than we needed to be out of the box in New York and got 37%, 40% 40 plus percent share as you see us kind of in that 15% to 20% share. Since we've retrenched that's the only material movement in share even though we've cut over a quarter of a billion dollars from marketing. If you look at the quarter, we lost about $44 million in March. So as you got out of those, that heavy launch period, our losses moderated considerably. If you think about the investment that we talked about making in terms of cumulative EBITDA losses, we said north of a billion in my mind when that, when I made that statement in when we launched in August, I was thinking a billion and a quarter to a billion and a half based on where we've gotten, share wise, I think a billion and a half is the right neighborhood. And if you look at what we've done to date, in about two thirds of our cumulative EBITDA loss, our investment into digital, measured in that way is now in the rear view mirror. So our losses come down considerably as we move forward. And we fully expect to inflect to EBITDA positive in digital as we move into football season of \u201823. And if you think about numbers that we've talked to in the past, the cross market play out of sourced in digital into brick-and-mortar we said was run rating, about 150 million of gaming revenue at the time of our last call that has since increased to over $200 million -- what are we focused on in the offseason we're focused on the shoulder season, I should say there's never an offseason. But football is clearly the driver of sports. So, before next football season, we're bolstering our customer service capability. We're bolstering our technology. We're most of bolstering our payments capability, so that we're ready for next football season. As I look back, we closed William Hill. In April, we had almost exactly 100 days to expect, or to the start of football season when we closed, William Hill, and our re-launch. So we were kind of sprinting, to keep up throughout football season last year, this year is going to feel much more comfortable thought for us in terms of being well prepared for anything that can come our way. We are absolutely thrilled with the bill business that we've built to date. But we're excited about what we can do as we move forward. To give you some context, we've had 1.4 million in Caesars reward signups, since we re-launched digital that came in through the digital channel. If you think about a typical Caesars property, we get, we get about 50,000, on average per property per year of new signups a little more in destination properties a little less in regional properties. If you think about a million for customers coming into the pipeline, in really a span of five months, it's extraordinary. And now the work in front of us is to identify which are the most valuable customers there. As you look back at the way football season was last year, you are getting the same offer whether you were a $50 player or you were $1,000 and above player, we didn't discriminate. That's kind of what we inherited, as we bought all of these brick-and-mortar assets for various operators in the past, marketing to the masses, with no with little discrimination. And what you've seen us do repeatedly in the brick-and-mortar business is targets that spend to our most valuable players, and not waste money on the unprofitable players. That's the task in front of us in digital. So you're going to see us segmenting in terms of our marketing as we move forward. And that's going to be a dramatic improvement in profitability as we move forward. So we are excited for that. As you think about where we are now that we've got two thirds of the losses behind us we should be a significant free cash flow producer as an enterprise going forward. We're expecting to close on the non-U.S. William Hill sale within this quarter I talked about Vegas Strip asset sale in motion. We would expect to be making significant reductions in our leverage within this calendar year and into \u201823 and beyond. And I'll pass to Bret for some specifics on liquidity and capital. Bret Yunker : Thanks Tom. 2022 is off to a nice start in terms of executing on our growth objectives alongside continued debt reduction. When the sale of William Hill internationals business closes in June, we will apply all proceeds to reduce debt, taking aggregate debt reduction over the past 12 months to over 2 billion. We expect the cadence of debt reduction to accelerate over the next 12 months through strong free cash flow and further asset sale proceeds. Our 2022 calendar year CapEx spend remains unchanged from our 24 call at $300 million of maintenance CapEx, $100 million of digital capital and approximately $700 million related to project capital. These figures exclude CapEx spend in Atlantic City which is escrowed and sits in restricted cash. We continue to model minimal cash taxes and approximately $800 million of cash interest expense for 2022 which we intend to reduce through debt repayment and opportunistic refinancing. Turn it back to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. So we've got some exciting projects coming online. As Anthony said, we've got a lot of our Atlantic City capital comes online before the summer season and then some of the restaurant stuff over the summer. We've got Lake Charles hitting in the fourth quarter this year. We're in the midst, we did we just did open the expansion of Horseshoe Indianapolis. We've got a similar project going at Harrah's Hoosier Park in Indianapolis. So we've got capital projects that will start contributing that have been drains on us in the past. We think we can continue to execute on basic operations, both digital and brick-and-mortar, and significantly reduce our debt over the next several quarters. Back to the key point, the key takeaway, I know there's a lot of concern about what's going on with the consumer what's going to happen around the corner. I can't stress enough that this business, particularly in Vegas right now is operating and generating as much cash as it ever has. So we feel very good about the balance of the year. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. Operator, ready to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys, thank you very much, Tom, just to kind of make sure I'm understanding how you articulated the digital investment. As you said, kind of a billion five is where you think it comes in. That would imply ballpark $475 million to $525 million of spend before turning profitable again, Is that how you're thinking about it in terms of between now and say, August, September of next year, when the NFL season starts, you'd be looking at something in the ballpark of $500 million of losses? Tom Reeg : Yes. And Carlo, obviously that'll do. We have got an Ohio launch in front of us, that would be the only launch that I can think of that would have significant costs surrounding it. And so how we come out of the box in Ohio will be a governing factor in terms of where we would be, but that's the rights we\u2019ve got. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. And then just on the iCasino side of the business. I know you guys were, you talked about it previously, putting more content on and making a bigger push there. Does the $500 million kind of contemplate some additional efforts on that side of digital business? Tom Reeg : Yes, that's inclusive of everything that we have in front of us in digital. Carlo Santarelli : Okay, great. And then just lastly, kind of on Las Vegas, putting into context kind of all the room nights of the revenue that's booked for the convention center, as well as kind of the 11% mix of room nights in the fourth year moving the 13% in the 1Q. Where do you think that mix kind of sits out on a 2023 basis? And then where do you think it shakes out pro forma for the asset sale and the separation from Rio, so maybe on a 2024 basis, just in terms of group room night mix. Tom Reeg : So I would say leaving aside the Rio, you should expect to group room night mix in a normal world would be north of 15% for us somewhere between 15 and 20. As you remove Rio from the equation, you'll have that will creep up slightly the big group at Rio is World Series of Poker, which is coming to the strip this summer. So that's already shifting as we speak to that. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, Tom. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Tom, have you seen or experienced a noticeable difference from your competitors with regard to marketing promos? Just broadly, customer acquisition costs, meaning have your larger competitors pivoted away, providing for an incrementally more rational environment. Tom Reeg : In turn, you're talking about digital? Joe Greff : On the digital side. Sorry, yes. Tom Reeg : No, no out that I can speak to. I think everybody else is spending fairly much fairly well in line with where they were before. Joe Greff : Great. And then Brett, you talked a little bit earlier in your prepared comments about opportunistic refinancing. Can you talk about the timing of this? And does that timing coincide with the closing of William Hill and later in the year of a strip asset sale? Bret Yunker : Yes, I think those think up pretty well for the summer. When you think about closing William Hill, where we get to on the Las Vegas asset sale alongside a lot of our debt becomes callable July 1. So I would be looking at the third quarter as a likely window for us to be refinancing. Joe Greff : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is now open. Steve Wieczynski : Yes, hey, guys good afternoon. Tom, so you talked about the strength in Vegas has continued into the second quarter. And obviously so far April's had a lot of big events, concerts, it says the NFL Draft. And I'm just wondering, as we kind of think about comparisons moving forward, is the second quarter going to be a little bit of a, an anomaly or, is the rest of the year kind of going to be in a very similar position from not only a group standpoint, but from a an event standpoint. And then maybe as we think about the second quarter for next year, was the draft big enough to call out? Or was it just, kind of average, if that makes sense? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Steve, in terms of group calendar, going forward group calendar going forward is very strong. Second quarter, and beyond, as we talked about, World Series Poker comes to the strip in that timeframe, as well. In terms of the draft, I would say, from a visitation standpoint for the market, very, very strong. Not a particularly great gambling crowd. So good for visitation, but casino numbers were kind of average. So I certainly wouldn't expect it we're pointing to the lack of that next year is any kind of headwind. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, got you. And then, Tom you talked about getting back to or getting to that breakeven point on the digital side of things in the, football season of 2023. And you called out how you're kind of changing around some of your marketing strategies. And I'm guessing, I'm guessing when you talk about that breakeven point in the fall of 23, does that include those marketing changes, or as you start to implement those marketing changes? Could that timeframe get accelerated? Tom Reeg : I'd say yes, that's, that's our best peg, as we sit here today. Obviously, the couple of quarters before football season in 23 tend to be lower volume sports quarters, so lower loss anyway. So is it possible? It sneaks a little bit earlier? I'd say that's possible. But I'd be banking on inflection in fourth quarter as we sit here today. Steve Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Barry Jonas : Great, thanks, Tom. You've talked in the past about potential 40% ROI on that $1.5 billion in digital losses. I'm curious what you think has to happen across the market and fees are specific to see those types of returns and what you think a reasonable timeline might be. Tom Reeg : So I don't think there needs to be anything heroic for that needs to change for the business to become profitable. And I've actually been talking about 50% plus cash ROI. You can see where our handle is today. You can make assumptions on where our handle will go in the future. And where your hold is going to shake out in sports and iCasino based on a lot of history. What happens functionally is your customer base becomes dominated by existing customers rather than by brand new customers that are taking advantage of a new customer promo offer. And so as you shift more out of business dominated by new customers, and as I as I said, we had a million four sign up for Caesars awards since we launched and those that deposited and became active in digital, almost certainly did, did so through a promo, those promos are different, as you become a season customer. What gets the headlines in terms of deposit matches, things like that that's not what happens as customer\u2019s season and your margin profile changes significantly. And the other thing that's going to change, I touched on in my remarks. In the in football season of \u201821, the every customer, regardless of value, was getting a similar offer. And so what's going to happen as we move into \u201822 football season and beyond is we're going to segment our customer base based on words. And we're going to target our promotional spending at our profitable customers, which is going to be a much smaller subset of that larger group. And that's going to have two significant change, two significant impacts, you're going to build loyalty among that that group that is targeted, and you're going to increase profitability as you increase share of wallet, you're still going to have activity from those that are not targeted to the same degree, but your profitability on those customers is going to change dramatically, because they're not getting the marketing officers or the marketing officers that come out. And so we have significant history in Nevada, in particular, what does a stable state look like from a margin standpoint, customer activity standpoint and promotional standpoint, all of our states are going to end up looking in some form or fashion, like Nevada with different puts and takes based on tax rate and competitive environment. But it's going to look nothing like the environment that you're analyzing now where a state launches, nobody has any customers. And it's the Wild West that those days are already in our rear view mirror in most states, as we move forward. There's going to be some new states, but as a percentage of the business, it's going to be much more of an existing customer and existing state crowd. And the states are going to start to look more like the steam season states in our portfolio. Barry Jonas : Got it, got it. And then just follow up on the land business. Current trends and the outlook Tom are seem really strong. But I'm just curious if there's any remaining negative impact you're seeing from COVID. I guess that would include any of the older demographic not back yet or anything else you wanted to highlight? Tom Reeg : No, we have seen 55 plus return post Omicron. They're still not as strong as the younger cohorts. But they're, they're coming back. And there's more coming back every week. Barry Jonas : Great, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Thomas Allen : Thank you, sir. Just on the digital side, Tom you highlight Ohio is like the only state where you really have to invest in this year. Maryland may launch this here. Is your comment just on Ohio because you think Maryland will probably launch next year or is there just a difference in where you see the opportunity between those two states? Tom Reeg : Yes, Thomas. I'm skeptical Maryland launches mobile in 22. Thomas Allen : Okay, so still a good Maryland's still a good opportunity for you, it\u2019s just\u2026 Tom Reeg : Oh yes, and if and when mobile launches, you should expect us to be competitive there as well. Thomas Allen : Perfect. And then any commentary around Ontario market and what you've seen to date in terms of the competitiveness and potential or both sides of it. Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yes, I'd say we have Ontario is a unique animal given the grey market that existed there before and the restrictions on what you're able to do. So we are, we're building our capabilities in Ontario, but you shouldn't expect us to, you shouldn't expect to see us throw a lot of money in Ontario. We expect to be a player. We expect the market to grow steadily, but that's not going to be a big needle mover one way or another for us. Thomas Allen : Okay. And then, lastly on the brick-and-mortar business, what are you seeing in terms of labor availability, your competitors, increasing marketing, any other kind of cost changes, big cost ranges you're seeing that you want to call up? Tom Reeg : Labor is still tight. It's gotten better. Obviously, we talked about how Anthony talked about how we were able to remove our caps, as we ended first quarter. That was as a result of a lot of hiring effort and activity. So we're feeling better. Labor costs are higher, but nothing that's a considerable drag on the organization's gaming taxes is our number one expense category. And thankfully, those are -- those don't inflate. And if, if they do, it's because you're getting more gaming revenue and, and getting increase on a percentage of revenue basis. So we feel while there are pressures, the strength in the underlying customer activity strength, is swapping anything that we see on the cost side. Thomas Allen : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America. Your line is now open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I don't think this has been touched on. But Tom, I think in the prepared remarks, it was mentioned that if I caught it correctly, and please correct if it's not, but the April in the regional markets is was trending well and better than March. And I think that's a little different than some of the patterns and some of the other companies that we've heard about. So could you talk about that a little bit more if I caught it correctly, and what might be driving that? Tom Reeg : For us we've gotten your margins have continued to increase so that, your rate of increase is not like January to March, but we're still improving. We've got properties like New Orleans that were under significant COVID restrictions that came off just before the Final Four in March. So we saw the benefits in April, Atlantic City has been particularly strong for us, even with construction disruption. So that's been a strong performer. Northern Nevada for us is has just been incredible for the -- going on, what 18 months now. So it was we've got some particular pockets that are strong. We're up, we're up against a very difficult comp in the second quarter given. This is when stimulus checks went out. But we feel good about comping against those numbers. Shaun Kelley : That's great. And then you have two markets I wanted to touch on specifically one you kind of just did, which was, we've heard about a little bit of potential softness in Northern Nevada, and then also in the southeast, so maybe ex-New Orleans, which is a bit idiosyncratic to you but any comments on just behavior in those particular markets? It sounds like I said, like Northern Nevada might be swimming along just fine, but just yeah, any thoughts there? Tom Reeg : Yes, Reno and Tahoe for us have been stellar performers really since reopening. We could do we could do better than a quarter of a billion dollars of EBITDA out of Northern Nevada in \u201822, which was not in the realm of what we were thinking before we before we did the Caesars transaction. So the strength there is continuing and -- setting for us the southeast outside of New Orleans, you're generally talking about smaller properties that whether they move up or down, aren't going to swing our broader numbers much. So New Orleans is the key there. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Stephen Grambling : Thanks. On the 1.4 million in new ads, the loyalty program through digital, how did the demographics of this group compare to what would normally sign up? And how is the frequency and spend per visit in the cross sell that you reference or even mix of tables versus slots on property compared to the existing base of rewards customers? Tom Reeg : I appreciate those questions, Stephen. But that's the level of granularity I'd rather not get into on our database [ph]. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. And then should we interpret that the $200 million and cross sell is purely incremental. So the like-for-like customer revenue, as we look at 1Q, we would back out that $200 million might pick that would be down. So it's really just the digital piece that's keeping trends strong stable in the industry as we attract a new customer. Tom Reeg : Well the $200 million is an annual number, so you're talking about $50 million of quarterly spend, that gets up that gets to that number, that's a pure additions through the digital channel, if you want to take it to the level of customers would sign up and there would be some, if digital didn't exist, there would be in addition, through Caesars Rewards, that's a derivative level, that's not useful to get into on the call. But you should consider there's $200 million casino revenue on an annual basis that's running through the business now about 70% of that into destination markets, the rest into regional. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And maybe if I can see one other one on that cohort, meaning, have you been actually trying to market at all at this point to that cross sell or is that something that could actually build the incremental cross sells, as we think about moving throughout the year. Tom Reeg : I would say we've had baby steps in that direction to date that most of that number is naturally occurring. Where you should expect that to be a considerable area focus for us when I talk about marketing to profitable customers. This is a group that really all came in the door in kind of 120 day period, as I talked about that swamps what the rest of the organization does on an annual basis. So as we sort through them, that you should expect that to be a target focus for us as we move forward in an area where we can drive revenue throughout the enterprise. Stephen Grambling : Sounds great. Thanks so much. Tom Reeg : Thanks Stephen. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John DeCree from CBRE. Your line is now open. John DeCree : Hi, Tom, thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow up on some of your comments in the prepared remarks. First on the regionals. If you mentioned that margins ramped from the high 20s in January till we're 37% in March, and sounds like a lot of that was Omicron impact in January, the occupancy coming back in Vegas is a bit more tangible for us to kind of contemplate. Can you kind of talk about that margin ramp in regionals that you mentioned New Orleans, normalized maybe that's a chunk of it, but kind of help us understand the ramp there, was it just Omicron or some other stuff kind of working through as well as you ramp back up in the regionals? Tom Reeg : It's just Omicron. Remember, John, in our regional we have a number of destination markets, New Orleans, Atlantic City, Northern Nevada, that all would have had the same and similar visitation and occupancy trajectory as Vegas had in the quarter, it's really a function of that. John DeCree : Okay, that's helpful, clarity. And lastly, on the cutting back on the mass marketing or media spend at the Digital level, where you really have seen your handle share, unchanged, or normalized. Was that surprising to you? Or anything about that surprising, and some of the resilience that you've seen. I mean is that Caesars Rewards at its finest, or how would you kind of characterize that trend once you pull back on that spend? Tom Reeg : I think it's the effectiveness of the campaign that was developed by Chris Holdren, Sharon Otterman in digital that we started this in August with very little recognition from the average consumer that Caesars was associated with sports and sports betting. And certainly after the New York launch, there's very few people that would be possible likely sports bettors looking for an app that didn't know that Caesars was a choice. And so it was really just a job well done in terms of getting our customer recognition up. You do you hook them into Caesars Rewards. We told you that what we've seen in Caesars Rewards is that creates a stickier customer. And we're seeing the benefits of that since we pulled back on mass market spend. John DeCree : Great. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate the additional color. Operator : And thank you. And our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Katz : Hi, afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking their question. Tom, if we could just go back to the strip asset row for a minute. I'd like to just be clear about there is, there is a time period. And is that, should we consider that an outside time limit? In other words, could it potentially be sooner than that? Or is it necessarily, six months? Tom Reeg : Well, David, miracles happen every day. But my experience has been when you get a lot of lawyers involved, the work extends to whatever the maximum allowable deadline is. So if we finished one day ahead of that six months, I'd be very pleased. David Katz : Okay. Fair enough. And I just like to go back to one of your prepared comments around being I believe the quote was meaningful, free cash generator this year? Have you sort of put any order of magnitude around that or sort of walked across any of the approximate details to help us with our just sanity check our model? Tom Reeg : Yes, I mean, we can go through offline. But if you if you think about round numbers, we've been run rating, ex-Omicron something 4 billion or better in EBITDA, you had about 2 billion in outflows between interest expense and lease expense, about a billion of CapEx and a billion of digital loss. Roughly speaking, in then the capital from asset sales would be excess that pays down debt now with half a million of EBITDA loss plus in front behind us in digital. As you look through the rest of the year, we should be a free cash flow producer on an operating basis after CapEx addition to the proceeds that we generate from asset sales. And Brad, Brian and our team did a great job of managing through a heavy cash use quarter to where we come out in a good position and should be significant free cash flow producer from now former. David Katz : Got it? Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Dan Politzer : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So we've heard a lot of this earnings season about strong Travel and Leisure demand. I mean, I guess as you look across your portfolios and your properties. Do you think that these properties in Northern Nevada, New Orleans, Atlantic City, those markets, you kind of mentioned, do you think they have, a longer runway for growth from here then maybe some of the earlier to recover properties in some of your other segments? Tom Reeg : I think that there's, you're seeing a migration of the customers right, when and I think this is the crux of your question. When we had the reopening after the pandemic, people wanted to get out of their house they were trapped for quite some time. They were comfortable traveling in a lot of cases a limited amount. They wanted to get out of the house but they were comfortable going somewhere in their car. And so you saw this big burst of demand in regional markets. And if you think about other times where demand was crimped for any reason in Casino, what you see is you see some substitution out of destination trips into regional markets. And if you want to argue that there was some of that, in 20, and 21, I think you've got a leg to stand on. And as the picture surrounding the virus has gotten better, we've seen increasing willingness to travel, willingness to get on a plane, go somewhere where you're staying away from home for 2, 3, 4 nights. And that's what you're seeing now in our regional destination properties in Vegas, in particular, and I think you've got some pent up demand for group travel that we're really just getting into. Now, you're seeing wash rates come down considerably, I'd expect that to continue. You have people that were used to being on a plane going to group meetings that haven't really done that in two, two and a half years at this point. And I think you're going to see that as the group calendar begins in earnest, are we really that's kind of another leg that we haven't seen yet. So I think this is just part of a migration of people getting more comfortable as the virus recedes. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then then on digital, I guess, high level, I think about you guys have this big database, big omni channel presence, all these trip properties. How do you think about leveraging this over time given, up to this point and build like, you've been mostly sports centric? Whereas I think right now, you're just kind of real time rolling out your eye gaming content? Like, is it reasonable that over time, we should expect the mix to shift more to the casino and online casino side? Tom Reeg : From where we are today, most definitely. I would expect iCasino to be a significant contributor to the profitability metrics that we laid out. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just one quick housekeeping. On corporate expense, I think that ticked down a bit, sequentially. And was there any kind of anything specifically call out there? Tom Reeg : Good old Eldorado business model in effect, but nothing specific? Dan Politzer : Got it. Tom Reeg : We\u2019re making add new papers launch now. Dan Politzer : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Bain from B. Riley. Your line is now open. David Bain : Great, thank you so much. First, just big picture question, Tom, a few have reported positive real time trends just as you have. I think your stance is a little bit better than those. But investor focus on our end continues to be sort of the broader intermediate term macro. And I know you spoke to specifics, why structurally out of COVID, were stage four, potential growth. When you look at gaming as an investment, which I know you do, in addition to the structural setup with that, versus other consumer discretionary industries, can you speak to a little bit or speak to the gaming business in general, and some things that maybe investors should consider? And maybe Anthony wants to speak to that as well. Tom Reeg : Yes, I did say there's, there's clearly something about gaming even within travel and entertainment with the social aspect if you want to, you walk the floors here and see groups of people that have not been out with each other in quite some time enjoying them. So there's, there's a social aspect to this that I don't know how well we appreciated this until it was gone. And that's, I think, a significant driver of what we've got going here. I know that as investors sit here today, crouched under their desks waiting for the next shoe to drop in inflation or economy we've been living with inflation for with for significant witnessed significant inflation for about a year now, we've seen no real impact on gaming spend, we just reported a quarter where GDP was down what, One and a half points. And this business, not our business, the business of casinos, in particular, held up quite well. So I can't tell you what's going to happen in September or December, or March, but the resilience of this business and casino customers generally, has been extraordinary. And none of us would have imagined that we would shut our doors for months at a time. And nobody knew what would happen when we reopen. But I look at other sectors, travel and entertainment consumer facing, the level of demand that has come back here has just been great to see. And like I said, as I walk through our properties now, this feels like what we were buying when we announced this deal back in June of 19. So we're super excited to see where it goes from here. David Bain : Okay, great. And then my, my other one was on California, if the, passes in November, you get a scan. I know a lot of unknowns with the landscape and taxes. But big picture, would the strategy match New York, just given the success there or to move more to partnerships or other things that you've learned from the New York opening, I'm just trying to get a big picture on big market openings, because I can see, I think still has a ways to go. So what we should look for in future years. Tom Reeg : Yes, so California obviously between our Indian partnerships and our Vegas assets, we have an enormous California database. We would expect to be an aggressive competitor for business if and when that stayed. Launches, there are things that we learned in New York in terms of how we would tailor an offer and what we would shoot for but we would expect to be among the leaders in California like we are in most of the states where we operate. David Bain : Okay, and does that change with iCasino new states going live versus LSB? Tom Reeg : No, iCasino as we've talked about is it's a function of getting our app up to snuff in terms of game count, that's finally almost complete. And then you should expect to see us become much more visible in terms of marketing that business and becoming a real competitor. We didn't want to spend marketing dollars to send customers to what in our view was a substandard product. As we talked we've talked about David, when we took for William Hill, we [Indiscernible] had a single employee on the iGaming side. So we had a lot more work to do there than we did even in OSB. But we expect to be a formidable competitor there. And we're, we're now in position to start that process. David Bain : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Chad Beynon : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Tom. Just kind of piggybacking on the end of your your last comment. You mentioned Liberty is expected to be in all markets by the end of the year. I think you said Illinois migrated over in March. I'm not sure if Pennsylvania is migrated over. Are there any other major markets we should be aware of kind of on the come in the next couple months? And then more importantly, do you believe that or how long should it take for you to get to you know a market share that you're happy with after these platforms are switched over? Can we get there by the end of NFL season or does it take another cycle of seasons tax? Tom Reeg : So, the other state that still needs to come on Liberty is Nevada which is obviously a big one for us. And in terms of building share, these are states where we're undeniably late to the game. And we're going to be smart about how much resources we throw at them, but role in tying them into our brick-and-mortar business. Obviously, we've got a lot of customers out of Pennsylvania, both in Chester and in Atlantic City. And then we've got four, a number of three Illinois properties that have significant databases and you should expect us that's what we're going to mind. And we'd expect to being continue -- continue to grind higher in market share. And if you're asking, do you think will be at our peak by this football season? I think we'll still be growing beyond that. Chad Beynon : Great, thank you very much. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And, thank\u2026 Tom Reeg : Go ahead. Operator : And thank you. I am showing no further question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Reeg for closing remarks. Tom Reeg : Thanks, everybody for dialing into the call and we will talk to you following the completion of second quarter. See you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony Carano. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our second quarter was a record quarter for our consolidated property portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, excluding Caesars Digital, was $1.05 billion, versus $1.01 billion last year. Our Las Vegas segment delivered an all-time quarterly EBITDA record of $547 million, with revenues up 34% year-over-year. Our Regional segment delivered same-store adjusted EBITDA of $513 million, up 24% versus Q2 of '19. Caesars Digital reported a $69 million adjusted EBITDA loss, which was a dramatic improvement versus the first quarter of this year. In our Las Vegas segment, all areas of the business combined to contribute to the record EBITDA quarter. Excluding real rent payments, our Las Vegas segment generated EBITDA of $558 million and a 49% EBITDA margin. Occupancy improved significantly, reaching 97% as a result of strong demand and our ability to lift self-imposed occupancy caps. Strong occupancy when combined with the record ADR, resulted in the highest quarterly room hotel revenues for our Las Vegas segment and company history. Group and convention also posted an all-time quarterly EBITDA record, led by the strong performance of the CAESARS FORUM. Group room nights during Q2 '22 represented approximately 13% of occupied room nights in Las Vegas, up from 11% in the second half of '21. Forward group revenue pace for the remainder of the year and into '23 is up over double digits versus 2019. Our Vegas F&B operations delivered record profit during the quarter as well. And finally, results in our 55-plus segment, Las Vegas were up for the first time over 2019 since COVID began, and we're beginning to see a noticeable return to the market from international travelers. In the Regional markets, while results were down versus last year, operating results remained strong, especially versus 2019. Reported EBITDA of $513 million was up 24% to Q2 of '19 and up 29% when excluding impacts from the Lake Charles closure and construction disruption at Caesars Atlantic City. EBITDA margins improved 50 basis points to 36% on a same-store basis versus Q2 of '19, excluding Lake Charles and Caesars AC. July operating trends in our regional segment remained consistent with the trends we have seen post COVID. Our capital program remains largely unchanged. 90% of our room remodel programs in Atlantic City is now complete, and we look forward to several exciting food beverage concepts opening in October and November. Our land-based facility in Lake Charles is set to open in December and so is our expanded casino offering in Pompano. We expect to break ground on Caesars Danville in Virginia, Harrahs' Columbus in Nebraska and our casino expansion for Harrah's Hoosier Park during this quarter. Lastly, construction on our new hotel tower and additional entities at our New Orleans property is progressing well with the new Sportsbook and poker room set to open Labor Day weekend. These are all exciting projects that will generate a meaningful return on the investment for our company. As we look to the remainder of '22, we remain optimistic about our business as consumer trends remain healthy, especially versus 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain encouraged regarding improving group and convention trends in Las Vegas, the return of the international consumer as well as the potential for the full recovery of our older demographic consumer, which has been the most impacted to COVID-19. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in 2022 so far. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric Hession for some insights on the second quarter performance in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. The financial performance of our digital business improved significantly in the second quarter, both on a revenue and an adjusted EBITDA loss basis when compared to the first quarter of this year. As Tom previewed on our last earnings call, our strong gains in unaided brand awareness have allowed us to scale back our brand-related marketing spend. That reduction in combination with the reduced promotional investment environment translated into steadily improving results throughout the quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect a number of significant product enhancements for our customers in key areas such as cash out speed, customer service and parlay and alternative line offerings.  We also anticipate converting all of our Caesars' branded apps and sportsbooks to our Liberty tech stack by the end of 2022, burly enhancing the customer experience. In addition, our marketing teams will have new and enhanced ways to deliver offers and promotions to customers, ensuring that they receive them in the most cost-effective way. We continue to believe that scale is important for our digital sports betting and iCasino and poker offerings and pending regulatory approvals plan to expand into states and jurisdictions where allowed. We currently offer sports betting in 25 North American jurisdictions, 18 of which are mobile. IGaming is currently live in 5 jurisdictions, while poker is in 4.  As a result, we will continue to remain focused on growth through new state launches, investing from a tech perspective on product enhancements and remaining acutely focused on our expenses. I'll now turn the call over to Bret Yunker, our CFO. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Second quarter was outstanding from an operating perspective. And if you look back the past 18 months, we've now reduced debt by $2 billion alongside acquiring and standing up our Digital business. Our most recent debt reduction came from $730 million of proceeds from the sale of William Hill International business, $100 million of that was executed through open market debt repurchases below par. The other $630 million were applied to our 2025 term B that happened in July. We continue to produce strong free cash flow with an expectation to reduce debt further in the back half of 2022. I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Reeg : Thanks, Bret. I'm going to provide some more color on the quarter where we are now and some conversations that I've had with investors over the last 30 to 60 days. Starting in Las Vegas, $558 million of EBITDA free the real lease payment is up almost 10% over the prior record in Vegas, which was last year's third quarter also post merger. Vegas, coming into the quarter, the monthly cash revenue -- hotel revenue record in Vegas was $91 million. We exceeded that in April, May and June, and we're on pace in 2022 to generate over $1 billion in cash room revenue in Vegas for the first time.  Group business has come back extremely strong. We're seeing wash rates at or below historical levels as the pent-up demand for business travel starts to [indiscernible] itself in Vegas. That was about a $200 million EBITDA business in the prior Caesars pre-foreign convention center. We're pacing about 40% above that as we sit here today. So obviously, with the addition of FORUM, which was not in operation pre-pandemic, but extremely strong results for us. The strength in Vegas has continued into the third quarter. You should expect to see kind of normal seasonality in August when it's just a little cooler than the surface of the sun. You should see -- expect to see occupancy track back to the mid-90s from the high 90s, but we'd expect to be back in the high 90s September and beyond, and that's what our forward bookings show us. So Sean [indiscernible] and his team in Vegas have done an absolutely fantastic job. We've done all of this with Caesars Palace torn up for most of the year with our front entrance work. That finishes in September. So in this quarter, we should be pretty well done with everything you've seen at the front entrance of Caesars, which should eliminate construction disruption there. We've opened Vanderpump and Nobu and Paris. And I'll be out for the Martha Stewart restaurant opening in a couple of weeks in Paris. So that property is transforming as well. So we're extremely excited about that. If you move to regionals, you still have the drag in Atlantic City. Caesars, in particular, is under heavy construction as you might be hearing from numerous others. In a number of industries, it's difficult to bring in your construction projects on time, given supply chain issues. So we were hopeful that all that would have been done prior to 4th of July, the bulk of it should be done by the end of August.  So you're seeing -- you should see Atlantic City numbers start to firm up. New Orleans is starting to track back toward where it was before, but still is a laggard among the regionals. And then Lake Charles will open before the end of the year. Remember that's about a $15 million LTM EBITDA drag, should be something north of a $65 million LTM swing once it opens. So we're excited about that. We've got it on the Atlantic City projects coming online. We've got Horseshoe Indianapolis and is less than a year into it and Hoosier Park with a similar table expansion, should come online towards the end of the year. So we're excited about the dollars that we've got out there and the returns that we're going to get on them. In terms of brick-and-mortar, obviously, there's a lot of discussion about the broader economic picture. My first point would be we've done what we've done in 2 consecutive quarters of falling DP. The average recession since the depression, I think, is 10 months. So we're hoping that we're -- for the end of this current environment. But the consumer continues to hold up quite well for us. We've seen unrated play that has softened offset by strength in rated play particularly at the higher end of our database.  We've seen international come back to Vegas really in the last 4 weeks, so we're excited about that. And obviously, the stimulus checks were a boom in last year's second quarter and early in the third. But July for us was -- July of '21 was our best month ever, and we're neck and neck with that in '22. Particularly hard to talk about Digital. Obviously, that's been a topic of conversation for a number of quarters. If you'll recall, we headed into last -- we closed the William Hill deal 100 days before the opening kickoff of NFL season. And when you do a U.K. acquisition, there's no prepping before close. You start from a standing start on day 1. Eric Hession, Chris Holdren, their team did a great job of standing up the app, getting our brand out there and making us competitive out of the box.  As I said on the last call, we got to about 15% nationwide handle share, again, both states that we're in, states that we're not in. And our unaided awareness got to a point where we were comfortable pulling back on advertising spend. So we have pulled a planned hundreds of millions of dollars that we were planning to spend. We don't think our competitors have followed us, they're still spending. And our share has been stable. And if you look at our losses in the second quarter, each month improved on the month before. So May was a smaller loss than April. June was a smaller loss than May. Obviously, we finished second quarter -- sorry, we finished July 2 days ago, so I'm talking about preliminary numbers, but Digital for July was nearly breakeven for the company. So I would expect as we get into football season, which is clearly our acquisition period in this business, you're going to see some modest losses return as we acquire new customers. But given that we damn near turned profitable in July, I'm extremely confident that we will be a profitable business at least by the fourth quarter of '23. And I view that business as we have made that -- I told you it was $1 billion through last quarter.  So you've got to add the $69 million of losses in this quarter. I told you in last quarter's call that I'd expect us to end up at about $1.5 billion of cumulative EBITDA losses. It doesn't look like we will get near that $1.5 billion on the way the business is performing now. And so we are -- we want to prove the concept. We've proved we could carve out a significant piece of the business. Now we want to prove we can make a profit, and then we'll talk about fighting for additional share on the other side of that. But we are extraordinarily pleased with where Digital is in a short period of time and really excited about this football season where we come in with our legs under us rather than running as fast as we can to keep up.  So the last piece I want to touch on is leverage, which is a popular topic these days. We have a long track record. We do an acquisition and then we delever. And Bret has told you, while we were standing up Digital with those $1 billion of EBITDA losses in the trailing 12 months, we paid down $2 billion of debt. We expect to continue to pay down debt. If you look at this quarter, even with the Digital loss, we're at about $1 billion of EBITDA. We've got -- we have some capital that's coming online, some returns that are coming online. The Digital business continues to improve. So if you just use -- and to be clear, I'm not giving any guidance. I'm looking at this quarter. If you look at a $4 billion business, our net debt -- lease adjusted debt is a little under $22 billion. So we're under 5.5x levered today. We're generating somewhere between $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion of free cash flow. Now a lot of that is going into growth capital for the time being. But if you think about a recession, of course, you've seen how we behave in a recession, you saw how we behave in a pandemic. The growth capital would start to shut off. But if you look at prior recessions, you're looking at a business that should be mid- to high single-digit revenue declines at worst in Regional, less in Vegas with what's going on now.  If you run that at a 50% flow-through, we're still doing about $1 billion of free cash flow a year. So we're very good about where we are leverage-wise. As you know, we have an ongoing sales process for [indiscernible] a strip asset that's governed by the VICI agreements and ends about another month to run. So I'm not going to provide play by play there, but know that we are in very good shape, balance sheet-wise. We would like to collapse the CRC bucket for those of you who follow our debt into our parent company.  You should expect that we'd be exploring that as soon as the markets open up, and we'll be kicking maturities out as well. So we don't -- for all the hindering about leverage and balance sheet all of a sudden, we really don't stress about that at all. We feel very good about the position we're in and where we're headed going forward. So those are my prepared remarks, let me flip it to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Carlos Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Tom, could you just talk a little bit about, obviously, the decline in Digital spend was significant. And I know during the last quarter, you spent considerable time kind of talking about what we would and what we're seeing on TV and in advertisements. As you guys make your transition now towards a profitable breakeven business that's sustainable going forward, where does kind of that advertising bucket lie in terms of the aggregate spend? Is that just something now that kind of run rate where it is? Or will we see incremental stuff that might have been contracted for extended periods of time to fall away as we move forward? Thomas Reeg : Thanks, Carlo. So you'll see this fall, if you're watching TV, part of our ESPN deal includes advertising buys. So you'll see some commercials largely on ESPN, and you'll see some local ads that run locally as well. And then you'll see a little bit in iGaming as we -- as that product gets toward where we're comfortable with moving customers on to our app. So you'll see -- I mean, compared to last fall, it's going to seem like we've left the year entirely, but you will run into a commercial or 2 depending on where you are and what you're watching. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up. Tom, if I look at the Regional markets in general, could you kind of talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there? Obviously, we see plenty of GTR. And that's been [indiscernible] relative to 2021, just given the difficulty in comparisons. But from a promotional standpoint, are you seeing any behavior that's any different than what we've seen over the last couple of months, quarters? Thomas Reeg : Nothing that's material to our business. I described the regional business as everybody had more money in his or her pocket a year ago from the transfer payments from the government. So that's both unrated play, that's softness of some of that business has disappeared. That's also rated play that played up last year versus historical levels. But we are quite comfortable that we should be running, let's call it, well into double digits, above 19% EBITDA in regional. And regional margins should be up 600, 700, 800 basis points from pre-pandemic.  So I would call that kind of the new normal as it were in this environment where you don't have that little bit of a bubble that you had last year. And this is part of what drove the Caesars acquisition for us, right? You remember when we were 2 markets, and if something happened in 1 of those 2 markets, it was a problem for the company. We wanted to become more and more diversified now. We're more diversified than anybody out there domestically. And what we saw is last year, Regionals carried Vegas when Vegas was struggling with people getting on planes and with virus-related restrictions.  And what you're seeing this year is regionals aren't quite as strong as they were last year, but Vegas is picking up the slack. So it's doing -- it's working as we -- as it was designed when we put the company together. Carlo Santarelli : And Tom, just to clarify that, when you say up 600, 700, 800 basis points relative to '19 -- sorry, you didn't say 800, I heard 600 and 700. That was -- that's on the current portfolio, which was I believe, if I'm doing the calculation right, around a 28% margin? Thomas Reeg : Yes. I'd say you're running 35% plus now. And then you're going to have Atlantic City construction roll-off, which should certainly improve revenue and margins. And then you're going to have Lake Charles come on, which should be a significant swing for us. Operator : Next question. Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph Greff : Just a question touching on price elasticity in Las Vegas, especially in light of airfares that are much more expensive now than history and for the driving traffic coming from Southern California with higher gas prices. Are you seeing any segment either on a net worth basis, on an age basis that's exhibiting spend reduction in relation to higher hotel rates, food and beverage pricing and such? And is the sensitivity on that maybe greater during seasonally slower period like you mentioned August when things are obviously pretty hot -- heated in Las Vegas? Thomas Reeg : I can't point you to anything in particular, a 55-plus has started to come back in Vegas, like they've not come back since pandemic. We talked about international has returned quite recently, which is a great sign for us. But we're -- when you're running 97% at these rates with up 10% over our prior record, really everything is going great in Vegas. And as we headed into Board meeting last week, earnings call this week, we checked with our booking channels, are we seeing any softness in Vegas bookings? And what came back is we've actually seen a pickup over the last 2 or 3 weeks. So it is extremely strong. I can't -- there are not strong enough words to convey how well it's going in Vegas for us. Joseph Greff : Great. And just going back to Digital and your comments there. Obviously, it sounds like the improvements both on a revenue basis and then the narrowing of EBITDA losses there. It sounds like it's largely Caesars specific and not necessarily a function of seasonality and/or the environment getting less irrational in terms of promos or customer acquisition costs. Is that a fair assessment? And then I'll add a part B to this. When we think about the losses for the next couple of quarters, and I know there's seasonality in the 4Q with football, do we -- would you expect that EBITDA loss in both the 3Q and 4Q to be below that $100 million level or approximating that 2Q $70 million, $69 million EBITDA loss level? Thomas Reeg : I would expect forward -- I expect we will not have a quarter of $100 million quarterly EBITDA loss in Digital again. We can talk about modeling off-line, but that business -- and we've had a lot of conversations about this, right? How are you going to become positive? The key factor to think about in the third quarter is you had no significant new states coming online. And so your business became dominated by existing customers rather than new acquisition customers. And I can't stress enough that the cost of the acquisition cost versus the retention cost is a dramatic difference.  So I would expect this football season for everybody. You're going to have New York and Louisiana who were very late last year. So you're going to have a fair amount of acquisition activity there. You're going to have some natural acquisition activity, but you don't have a new state of scale coming online to Ohio in January. So we feel pretty good certainly for ourselves. And I can't speak for what others are doing. We got almost $0.5 billion of what we were anticipating spending in marketing in the last 3 quarters of '22.  So this is a dramatic pivot for us. We're heartened that we haven't seen share deterioration and particularly with what we've seen in profitability. And you know we're really not wanting to lose money when we don't need to. And we've got a long track record of really turning highly subsidized businesses on the brick-and-mortar side into a far more profitable business. It's the same thing that we're doing in Digital. When we started Digital, we didn't have the ability to segment customers. And now we -- so you -- in effect, underinvest in your customers and overinvest in your worst. That's no longer the case. So you can be far more precise in what we're doing, and we see the fruits of that every day as results come in and it's great to see. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : Tom, you mentioned in your prepared or so-called prepared remarks, unrated play. You saw that slowing. And I guess the first question, is that across both Regionals and Vegas? And then the second question there would be, have you seen any spend pattern changes in your database tiers, meaning that low tier-rated player? Has there been any softness there? Thomas Reeg : So no difference in the unrated across markets. It's just casino play in general, doesn't move the needle as much in Vegas as it does in regional. In terms of tiers of customers, I think if you go to the lowest and the properties on the Mississippi River for us in the South, those started softening in January, February for us. And then have been stable, but you're talking about a couple of properties that are $20 million of EBITDA to $4 billion. So nothing that is material to the enterprise. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Understood. Second question, Tom, in terms of the Strip asset sale? I know you're probably very limited in terms of what you can say. But is the delay -- and I'm not sure if even that's the right term. But is the delay here really more around the rate and the funding environment versus the demand environment? Just I guess what I'm trying to understand is if the demand for Strip assets is still as strong as where as it was, let's say, a year ago? Thomas Reeg : So just to be clear, we've talked about this on other calls. It's very clear the time line that is laid out in the VICI documents that govern this. So we launched early this year, the deadline is by the end of the summer. And every deadline I've ever seen in deal land, the work goes into that deadline. For us -- and there's -- there are plenty of interested parties. Obviously, the financing environment is what it is. And if that's going to impact what someone will pay, there is a level where we're not going to chase it. I'm very happy to just clip the free cash flow and come back later.  But as we have discussed, this is a discretionary trade for us. We still think we can get it done within the parameters that we had set at the outset. But we are -- we certainly recognize we live in a market that moves day-to-day. And if financing conditions change, the outcome might change. But this has become -- for me, it's kind of amusing because when I first started talking about we're to sell our Vegas Strip asset, that the response from full sell-side and buy side was why would you want to sell the Vegas Strip asset? Look at how great it is. And we said there are times in the market that you don't have to go back very far, that where -- we didn't -- we wouldn't want to have owned this many rooms.  And now the conversations have turned to, oh my god, can you get this done? This is critical. This is a change in you, not in us. This has been discretionary from us, for us from day 1, and it remains so. So regardless of what level of fear is coursing through the investment community, we put our heads down and we do the work. And if we have a trade that makes sense for us, we'll do it. If we don't, we're fine with. That's far more than I wanted to say about the Vegas Strip asset sales, so no more questions on that. But that's where we are. Operator : Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. Barry Jonas : Auto traffic to Vegas has slowed according to Citywide, the LVCVA data. Curious if you're seeing anything like that across your database with California visitation? Thomas Reeg : Yes. We've just reported a record quarter, told you July is very strong as well. I mean yes, there is a seasonal in Vegas, third quarter is lower than second quarter because it's 120 degrees. But beyond that, we're really seeing no change in Vegas activity. Unidentified Company Representative : The June traffic at the airport was record levels as well. Thomas Reeg : That's right June seats in Vegas set a record. Barry Jonas : That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, any thoughts on the Centaur option here? Thomas Reeg : For us, you should not expect us to exercise the put. You'll have to ask VICI what their intentions are on the call. But in any event, like any option, I would expect if VICI intends to exercise, they would be looking toward the end of the option period. But I don't know that's a supposition if I was in their shoes, not that I'm telling that. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Just two questions on the Digital side. Tom, I was just intrigued by the comment around, you will not get near to the $1.5 billion of losses. I think you [indiscernible] it on a quarterly basis, but any chance we could get you to help us set a new kind of overall level for us or not quite prepared to do that? Thomas Reeg : Hard to do in front of football season. We're at -- what are we at? We're at $1 billion, we're at $1.069 billion now. I'd say think about that neighborhood for the next couple of quarters and then improving to inflection to positive at worst in the fourth quarter next year. Shaun Kelley : Super. And then one for either the group or for Eric specifically. But we're thinking about the Digital strategy, 2 parts here. One is obviously, you pulled back some kind of -- has the market overall changed very much as it would relate to promotional spending? And just kind of how are you seeing that cadence work? And then for your own product lineup, can you just talk a little bit more about how you kind of hope to make some inroads on online gaming? Maybe just the product road map on the iCasino side a little bit, given the strength of your database, we've always thought that, that's a huge opportunity for Caesars. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, Shaun, sure. So in terms of what our competitors are doing, we really haven't seen much of a change at this point. We don't know exactly what their plans are for football, but we've heard no indications that they're changing the original strategy. We believe that the performance that we had in the second quarter and as we head into July and the next few months, support our notion we can pull back. And that customers are more sticky than we had originally thought. And that, that's allowing us to be able to have the large reduction to still maintain kind of the revenue levels we were at.  In terms of the iCasino, I would say you're exactly right. And quite frankly, that's an area that I think all of us around the table are probably the most [indiscernible] with. We really haven't gained the traction that we want and given our knowledge of how to use those customers and to market to them and to segment to them and what they're looking for in terms of game type based on the retail business, we should absolutely be a market leader in the iCasino space.  We've been challenged from a tech perspective as well as from a marketing perspective. And unfortunately, that is lagging the sports betting side. So later in the fourth quarter, we're going to be making some enhancements on the tech side, so that we'll be able to do segmented marketing. And some other things we'll be able to do free spins coming up, which are all basic things that you'd expect would be in place. But unfortunately, they were just difficult from a tech perspective. So I do agree with you that, that is an area of opportunity. And I think if you were to look starting in the fourth quarter into next year, you're going to see us start to make some real progress there. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : If we could talk about just the margins so that we can -- look, 90 days seems like a world away. I know at one time, we were talking about 4%. Is that -- it's still a neighborhood where we think we can live either near term or long term? Thomas Reeg : Well, at the 558 we're 49% in the quarter. World Series of Poker happened in the -- largely in the second quarter. That's additive to EBITDA. It's about a 100 basis point drag on margins. So from an operating perspective, we were at 50% in the second quarter. If you think about forward, obviously got a little bit of seasonality third quarter, fourth quarter [indiscernible] drag on margins. So from an operating perspective, we were at 50% in the second quarter. If you think about forward, obviously, you got a little bit of seasonality third quarter.  Fourth quarter, you might have read, we're going to have some entertainment come online. That's a lot of revenue sales, but that's going to impact Vegas margins. So you're going to have -- when that particular entertainer starts, you're going to have a lot of revenue run through that goes to the artist, a little bit of profit to us and a better customer on the floor. David Katz : So 50% is where we're going to we're -- is still a comfortable place for us to hang out? Okay. Thomas Reeg : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Pulser with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : So I want to hit on regionals first. I mean, I think margins over the course of the quarter, if you could just kind of any color on how the cadence was? I think, because March was, I think, in the high 30s. And then how pace over the course of the quarter? And then certainly, I get there is some disruption from Lake Charles and Atlantic City. But as we think about the third quarter relative to the second quarter, it's typically -- those are your best 2 quarters of the year. So I wanted to make sure that's still kind of in place at this point? Thomas Reeg : Yes, that's still in play. I would say, month-to-month in the quarter was not a dramatic move across that many properties. So you should figure that the business was running at about the 36% level or so for the bulk of the quarter. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then in Las Vegas, I know there was some flooding recently. I wanted to check has that been fully cleared up at this point? And how should we think about the impact, if any, in the third quarter? Thomas Reeg : I just put my life jacket off [indiscernible] all the way over. It's -- there's no impact to the business at all. It's some good social media footage. Daniel Politzer : All right. And then just one last one. I think you mentioned that group was pacing up in Vegas around 40% versus 2019, including, obviously, FORUM. I mean how should we think about that on a -- I guess, excluding FORUM, is it still tracking up? And what's really driving that? Is it pricing? Is it just food and beverage, additional business or it's just volume? Thomas Reeg : It's all of that. It's volume. It's -- you've seen what we've done in other segments of the business that we run versus how they were run prior. The banquet business that comes online is -- it's accretive to margins, even the 50% margins in Vegas. And Michael Massari and his team have done a fantastic job of building a great calendar for us, and all of that comes together for a great outcome. Just to give you an example, Harrah's -- the second quarter, nearly 20% of room nights at Harrah's were grouped nights. And that's a property that had effectively zero prior to the FORUM Convention Center opening. Operator : Our next question comes from David Bain with B. Riley. David Bain : Great. First, I was wondering, you gave some color on structural forward growth drivers in Vegas. And you touched on the associated revenue with conventions. Can you big picture international? Is that a $50 million to $60 million business? And then you also mentioned the 55-year-old demographic returning. Just kind of wondering kind of where we are if you can quantify where that was prior to COVID versus today? Thomas Reeg : So directionally, 55 and over is now above in Vegas for the first time since pandemic, but it is still trailing younger cohorts on a comparable basis. So the younger cohorts are up more. That's a much -- in terms of order of magnitude, that's a much bigger piece of the business for us than international. International is a good story for us, but it's far smaller than 55 and over. David Bain : Okay. Great. And then one more, if I could. One industry report cited that the OSB Euro SB is looking at a black label site for VIPs. Do you see, Tom, segmentation coming to online? And can you take kind of what you've done offline to online and create margin outperformance, if you will? I mean is that something we miss when we structure our iCasino and OSB models at maturity, looking at international even before consideration of the land-based benefits? How does that trend? Thomas Reeg : Yes. I mean, wrapping it into Caesars Rewards, it should -- at maturity, it should be just like the brick-and-mortar business. So we should be able to get more share of wallet from our best customers and not overspend on small customers, which is the same idea as brick-and-mortar. I will say one of the things that you missed that I see missed in analysis of Digital is as we launched -- as all of our peers launched, you saw all these sports partnerships created, branding partnerships, affiliate relationships, all for customer acquisition at launch as these states launch.  That runs $0.25 billion through our Digital business today. Those are all contracts that run off -- depending on the contract, 2 to 5 years after they were signed. Now as you get into a more mature business, you're not going to be recutting those deals or you're not going to be recutting them at the levels that you started at. So that's going to be extremely accretive to EBITDA as those -- as the business is seasoned. And I know that's the case for everybody in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : In terms of sports betting, California initiatives, I believe there are 7 or 8 companies that have backed one of the bills. Can you talk about how you're positioned there? And more importantly, are there states in the U.S. where you would potentially take a hard pass given maybe a higher buy-in or a higher tax rate? Thomas Reeg : Sure. I struggle to think of a jurisdiction we would not go to in the U.S. if it opens. I guess, if you think of a very small state that puts up an enormous tax rate, that's a small possibility, but we want to be everywhere. In terms of California, we're not part of either initiative. We have a strong -- what -- we want to see sports betting in every jurisdiction that we can find. We'd love to see iCasino in every jurisdiction we can find. We have a decade-long relationship with a number of tribes across the country where we've been managing their assets through multiple contract renewals, which was a unique position when we bought Caesars. I've never seen that before. And we don't want to be in opposition to tribal interest when we're their partners. So we've remained neutral in California throughout. You should expect that to be the case in any state where tribes are at odds with the commercial interest. Chad Beynon : Great. And then I wanted to ask you about your kind of hypothetical 50% flow-through. And I know that was more of just kind of, again, a hypothetical if revenues declined and you were really just trying to make the point of strong free cash flow. But within that, I guess I wanted to ask in an environment where revenues are declining, are there some fixed costs, maybe in labor or other OpEx, where you could reduce costs? Obviously, marketing is at pretty low levels. We all understand how the rent -- the lease payments work. But yes, in this hypothetical situation, are there areas where you could kind of trim some of your \"fixed\" OpEx? Thomas Reeg : Yes. Chad, without question. You just saw us live through the pandemic. And the amount of cost that you can cut in these businesses is far beyond even what we thought prior to the pandemic, and we were among the most vocal that there were significant costs to be cut. So one of the benefits of the pandemic for us is you got a sense of what your customer -- what they were willing to tolerate in a softer environment. And I'm thinking in terms of hours of operation for nongaming amenities.  The -- what you can do in a soft environment is far different than what the world believed pre-pandemic. So, I think the -- both the 50% flow-through and the top line hits are far in excess of anything that we're expecting. I really said that to illustrate that even in that scenario, we'd be generating $1 billion of free cash. Operator : And next question from [indiscernible] with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Tom or any one, I wanted to just get a sense for how you're feeling about your Las Vegas room rate pricing power from here and outside of rooms being removed from the system like with the Rio, what inning do you feel like you're in, in terms of pushing rate just based on your present occupancies, which are really high? Thomas Reeg : I mean I think what you're going to see is the return of group is going to help us grind rate higher because that's going to push out our lowest rate customers. That's what's already happening. And keep in mind, we're about to cycle through where we'll be comping against self-imposed occupancy caps because of labor levels last year. So you're going to see even more significant flow-through as we get towards the end of the year with those caps off. So we feel extremely positive about the forward occupancy and rate environment in Vegas. As I said, we're on pace to do better than $1 billion of cash room revenue, which has never happened in Caesars. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then just one follow-up. Curious to hear about this Empire days, Las Vegas promotion you guys launched today, if this is a regular way type set of promotions, if it's sort of new or it's more offense or defense? And just any other ways that you'd like to share that you can activate the Caesar Reward system here for any various pockets of softness that we might see in the next 6 to 12 months? Thomas Reeg : Yes. This is a typical room sale that goes on every year. So there's nothing in particular to call out there. We're running at 97%. July was 96.5% occupancy. So we don't have a lot of extra room to fill at this point. So we feel very good about [indiscernible] and his team in revenue management for us and Sean as the operating leader in Vegas. We couldn't have done better in terms of what we inherited in that group and have a great degree of confidence in the results that will drive going forward. Operator : I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom for any closing remarks. Thomas Reeg : All right. Thanks for your time, everybody. We will talk to you after the third quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. In the third quarter, we generated a new consolidated EBITDA record excluding Digital of $1.05 billion. Our Las Vegas segment continued to deliver strong results with $491 million of adjusted EBITDA, excluding the real rent payment. Our regional segment delivered a new Q3 record with same-store adjusted EBITDA of $570 million, up 25% versus Q3 of '19. Caesars Digital reported a $38 million adjusted EBITDA loss, which was our smallest last quarter since rebranding to Caesars Sportsbook in August of '21. In our Las Vegas segment, all areas of the business combined to contribute to the strong EBITDA quarter. Excluding real rent payments, our Las Vegas segment generated EBITDA of $491 million and a 46% EBITDA margin. Occupancy was strong, reaching 94% driven by July and September. Cash hotel revenue and profit set a new Q3 record. Gaming revenue also set a new Q3 record during the quarter. Group room nights during Q3 of '22 represented approximately 12% of occupied room nights. Forward group revenue pace for the remainder of the year and into '23 is up over double digits versus '19. Results in our 55-plus segment in Las Vegas were up again in Q3 to pre-COVID, continuing the trend we experienced in the second quarter. International travel continues to recover and remains a tailwind. Las Vegas has further runway for growth with many exciting new entertainment and sporting events coming to the market over the next 18 months. In our regional markets, results strengthened in the third quarter, posting growth versus a strong third quarter last year. Reported EBITDA of $570 million was up 25% to Q3 of '19 and up 30% when excluding Lake Charles, which remained closed during Q3. EBITDA margins improved 840 bps to 38% on a same-store basis versus Q3 of '19, excluding Lake Charles. Trends in our regional segment remained very consistent over the last few quarters. Turning to an update on our capital program. Renovations in AC will complete in the first half of '23, with the opening of the Nobu Hotel Tower, and we're excited about the recent restaurant openings of Hell's Kitchen and Nobu at Caesars AC. Horseshoe Lake Charles is set to open on December 12th, and we look forward to showcasing this brand-new land-based facility. We also expect to open our expanded casino offering in Pompano in December as well. We expect to open temporary casinos in both Danville, Virginia and Columbus, Nebraska by midyear '23. Our expansion at Harrah's Hoosier Park is underway and should open by mid-'23. And lastly, our construction on our new hotel tower and additional amenities at our New Orleans property is progressing well with the new sports book and poker room recently opened. As we look to the remainder of '22, we remain optimistic about our business as consumer trends remain healthy, especially versus '19. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain encouraged regarding improving group and convention trends in Las Vegas, the return to the international consumer as well as the potential for the full recovery of our older demographic consumer, who has been the most impacted by COVID-19. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in 2022 so far. I'm extremely proud of our operating teams, their execution and their exceptional guest service. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric Hession for some insights on the third quarter performance in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. Our digital business reported revenue growth of over 120% and a smaller-than-expected EBITDA loss in the quarter. On the sports betting side, we recently started to realize the benefits from the efforts that we've made over the summer to improve the overall experience for our customers, specifically improvements in cash out speeds, customer service response times and our in-play parlay and alternative line offerings are all being well received by our customers. We've also created several analytical tools that provide real-time assistance and insights for our trading team allowing them to expand the number of markets we offer to our customers and to be more responsive during in-play trading sessions. As a result, our hold volatility has declined and our overall expected hold levels have increased. During the quarter, we also began to see the results of our initial segmented marketing campaigns that allow us to reward our customers more directly for their loyalty and play with us. These efforts contributed towards our net revenue growth as they allowed us to improve our promotional spending efficiency. We anticipate continued enhancements in this important area over the course of 2023. On the iCasino side, we hired a new leader for the vertical who started on October 1st. In conjunction with our tech team, we have an aggressive product improvement road map identified with numerous enhancements for our customers that will be rolled out as completed with a full product targeted for the start of the second half of 2023. iGaming remains a critical component of our digital growth strategy. From an expansion standpoint, during the quarter, we launched our online sports betting product in Kansas and upgraded our tech package in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C. to our most current version. We now offer sports betting in 27 North American jurisdictions, 19 of which offer mobile wager. In Q4, pending regulatory approval, we anticipate launching online sports betting in Maryland and on January 1st in Ohio. In addition, we plan on adding two new third-party retail locations during the quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Bret for some additional comments. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Q3 was another productive quarter from a balance sheet perspective as we permanently reduced approximately $900 million of debt using asset sale proceeds and free cash flow. We also successfully syndicated a new $3 billion credit facility comprised of a $2.25 billion revolver and a $750 million term loan A. 16 domestic and international banks subscribed to the new facility, and we appreciate their support. Total 2022 CapEx spend net of Atlantic City is now expected to come in at approximately $800 million, which is also our current estimate for total 2023 CapEx spend across growth and maintenance. Finally, we announced that we will be pursuing a downstate casino license in New York with our partner, SL Green. It will obviously be a very competitive process, and we look forward to putting our best foot forward when the RFP begins. Given the inherent sensitivities around the bid process, we aren't in a position to go into details around project costs at this stage. However, we can tell you now that the project starts with an existing building and will be financed within a new joint venture that is not on our balance sheet. Caesars will brand and manage the asset under a long-term management agreement and any equity investment into the joint venture will be very manageable relative to our free cash flow. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Brett. I'm going to touch a little further on the quarter, and I want to talk about October as well. In Las Vegas, very strong results in the quarter. Normal seasonality returned to Las Vegas in the third quarter. We also had a couple of headwinds that I would call out. And utility expenses for the quarter were extraordinarily high, particularly August, and we had the finish of the construction of the entrance, which caused some construction disruption. If you look at the impact of the two of those and add it back, you would end up a little bit ahead of last year on an EBITDA basis and similar from a margin standpoint. As you look into October, October was the strongest month in the history of Las Vegas for Caesars. We did over $200 million of EBITDA in October, which is up double digits versus last year on a consolidated basis. October EBITDA for bricks and mortar is pacing double-digit percentage above last year's October despite having one fewer weekend day in the 2022 period. Regional is obviously quite strong as well. It had a little bit of a margin improvement there. Strongest third quarter that we've ever had in regionals. And then we've got -- as Anthony touched on, we've got Lake Charles coming. We've got temporary casinos in Columbus, Nebraska, Danville, Virginia that will hit next year. We've got the completion of the Atlantic City spend as well and the Harrah's Hoosier Park in Indianapolis -- outside Indianapolis should finish by the middle of next year. So, a number of tailwinds, cash that you allowed us to invest as shareholders that you're going to see the fruits of going into the rest of '22 and into '23. I'd also like to touch on the strip asset sale and say that we intend to keep all of our strip assets as we move forward. We ran into a market where the cash flow of the asset continued to increase the ability of buyers to raise financing, made it a very easy decision for us to keep. I know that despite us talking about how this is and was a discretionary process for us, it created an unnecessary overhang in the stock. And I apologize to all of our shareholders for that. That was a self-inflicted error and that was me. So, we will be keeping our Vegas Strip assets as we move forward. In Digital -- October Digital inflected to positive EBITDA for us. So, we are extremely pleased that's 12 months ahead of the schedule that we anticipated. I think most of you are aware, we've got a fairly high profile liability out there with the Astros. So that will have -- that will be a swing factor in whether fourth quarter is positive as a whole, but we'd expect that we have inflected, and Digital will be a contributor as we move forward. So that's extremely exciting news for us. Great work by Eric and his team in Digital, and thank you to all of our shareholders for the capital to invest in that in Digital and the patience as we work through it. We continue to believe that on our $1.1 billion of cumulative EBITDA losses that maturity, we'll be doing in excess of 50% of that in annual EBITDA out of Digital. That business continues to outperform our expectations and really, really inflected over the last 60 to 90 days. So, we are quite pleased with that. With that, I'll flip back to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey guys. Good afternoon. Tom, I appreciate the commentary on Digital. Could you talk a little bit about how you foresaw or foresee going forward, the promotional environment, perhaps based a little bit on your experience in the 3Q as well as what you saw in October as we're now in the kind of the meat of football season. And then further, let's set aside the World Series liability, could I take your comments to kind of infer that perhaps next year, you're looking at a positive EBITDA contribution from Digital? Tom Reeg : Yes. For modeling purposes, Carlo, I'd expect you to be around breakeven, but I'd expect that we've got a really good shot that that's a contributor on a full year basis in '23. Obviously, that's subject to hold, but we feel very, very good about where we are. In terms of promotional environment, you've got -- we've talked for a very long time about how your customers as they come in, in new states, that's when they're taking advantage of sign-up offers that those are your highest -- that's your highest promotional spending. We've got, obviously, a mix this year of states, most of which are in their second year -- if not second full year, at least second year of operation during football season. So your promos are to your existing customers. That's typically a much smaller promotional bite than new sign-ups. But I'd also say, we have the ability to segment customers now, which we didn't last year. We've got a full year of looking at -- as you know, we had all spigots opened in Digital as we launched the business and launched the brand. Now we can look at various verticals and see what type of customer is coming in through the various channels and adjust our spend based on are we getting a return on our investment. And we made some significant changes there, led by Eric, in the last 60 days that have flowed virtually entirely basically shutting off particular segments and that cash has flowed immediately to the bottom line with no degradation in market position. So, we feel very, very good about where we're at. As I told you, this is what we've done on the brick-and-mortar side is figure out how to invest more in your best customers and less in your less profitable customers, and that's really the basic blocking and tackling that we're doing in Digital that has led to these results. Carlo Santarelli : Yes. I have noticed the latter personally. Thanks Tom. I appreciate that. And then just one follow-up. From the regional perspective, obviously, results were good against a difficult comparison. It looks like you guys were able to more or less keep OpEx kind of ex gaming taxes to the best of our estimation, flattish. Are you kind of where you need to be? Are there any pressures that are kind of creeping there that we need to be aware of outside of traditional labor inflation, things like that, or is this a pretty good run rate in terms of OpEx? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd say you're at a pretty good run rate. You're -- you've been around us long enough that we're never done, but we don't see any real cost that's on the sidelines. As you've touched on, we've got labor cost inflation that rolls through, but that's been for quite some time, and frankly, the labor picture continues to look better as we get quarters in the rearview mirror. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Joe Greff : Tom, just starting off on the digital side. As you talk about increasing profitability in this segment, can you talk about over the next few years, 2023, 2024 and beyond the magnitude of additional operating expenses coming out of that business, maybe particularly with some partnership expenses and how this might be sort of, I don't want to say low-hanging fruit or easy to extract efficiencies from, but can you talk about some of those that kind of gets you to increasing profitability as you think about some of those partnership expenses winding down? Tom Reeg : Sure, Joe. As you look at current business, you've got for us, what is a sports-dominated business at this point inflecting to profitability. Obviously, we have significant opportunity in front of us in iCasino. We think we now have the right leadership in place to attack that. So, we think that will grow from what's a fairly small contributor today, into a much more meaningful contributor. But, what I think you're referring to is as we launch, and this is not unique to us, this is throughout the entire digital space. There were a number of partnership deals signed up with media partners, with teams, with leagues that all kind of run 3 to 5 years. In our case, from let's say, the middle of last year. So you'll have some running off in a year, you'll have more running off over the next three years. And you'll look at -- there were assumptions made in terms of what you were willing to pay for those sponsorship opportunities -- those partnership opportunities that were based on customer generation, new customers to your platform. Obviously, we've got much more data today than we had before, and you're not going to be in virtually all of these cases in a launch situation anymore. So for us, that's something that runs in north of $200 million of annual expense. And you should expect as though -- and for now, that's a fixed expense for us. As long as those contracts are in place, you should expect some of them will live in a form that may not be as expensive as it is today. A fair amount of those will go away entirely, and that should flow straight to EBITDA for us if you're looking out in that \u201824, \u201825 timeframe that you laid out. Joe Greff : Great. And Tom, just to clarify your comments, switching over to Las Vegas. You mentioned the 3Q would have generated in Las Vegas EBITDAR north of last year and margins that are similar, and that delta between what you reported and those comments related to those 2 headwinds, utility costs and disruption at CPLB. Can you sort of break out the magnitude of each and explain to us maybe the elevated utility expenses, how do you think about that going forward? And is it recurring, is it onetime? And then, also sometimes you noted that corporate expenses were down a lot sequentially. Can you help explain that, or was there an expense shifted out to the properties versus what may have been in the past sort of allocated to corporate? Tom Reeg : Bret will take corporate expense. I'll take Vegas. Bret Yunker : On corporate expense, yes, we are a bit light to our typical run rate of 30 to 35 per quarter. That's due to a lack of transaction activity and a continued focus on all expenses. Tom Reeg : And for Vegas, Joe, if you normalize utilities, which was primarily rate in August alone, that's virtually the entire gap between Q3 of '22 or Q3 of '21. And then you have the construction disruption as well. To give you an idea, October on a preliminary basis, Vegas EBITDA margin was about 52% for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Tom, you just mentioned that Vegas did, I think you said $200 million in EBITDA in October. And I guess, the most simplistic way I can ask this question is, should the quarter end up being $600 million in EBITDA? And I guess what I mean by that is, obviously, with -- there's some holidays coming up and what not, I just want to make sure that expectations for the fourth quarter are rightfully set at this point. And hopefully, that makes sense. Tom Reeg : Sure, Steve. October is typically the strongest month in fourth quarter. November is the weakest month. Thanksgiving is not a particularly strong holiday. And your -- so November is the seasonal slowest in the third -- in the fourth quarter and then you get New Year's in December. So, if I were thinking about what does the quarter look like, October should be the best month, December should be slightly lower and November lower than that. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Perfect. And then second question, Tom, on the Digital side of the business, and clearly, there's been some significant progress made here in terms of getting that segment profitable. And I guess my question is -- or maybe give us your updated kind of thoughts about, down the road, do you see any kind of scenario where you would want to potentially spin this business off at some point? And I understand there's probably a lot of value here with the business being tied so closely to the brick-and-mortar side. But just wondering if that would possibly make sense at some point down the road to help the leverage side of the equation. Tom Reeg : So, I'd say that our competitive advantage here is tying it to the existing brick-and-mortar business and our Caesars Rewards database. And it would be my preference that that remains 100% owned by the parent company. If you get to different shareholder bases for the two businesses, there's a complexity introduced that you see in -- you can see that in some of our peers in terms of when you get to different shareholder bases in the same business. But I'd tell you, you know that we're constantly focused on how do we drive shareholder value. If you get into a market where that ultimately makes sense, and that's the way to increase the pie for shareholders in total. Certainly, that's something we would consider. In the recent market environment, there hasn't been much value placed on digital assets. So it's a very easy decision as we sit here today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : I wanted to dig in on regionals a little bit. The performance there in the quarter was obviously excellent and probably stronger than many of us were expecting. I was wondering if you could just kind of call out any key markets that might have driven that strength in the third quarter. And specifically if you could comment on Atlantic City. I feel like -- it's a big seasonal quarter for that market, but directionally, I think we had seen the Caesars Properties on a gross revenue basis not performing as well as some of the other market participants. I was curious if you're doing something different there, focusing on margin, just kind of how that market is evolving specifically? Tom Reeg : Yes. Sorry, what I'd say we're doing differently is we've had most of our market torn up during the peak season. So, we've had rooms out of service, both at Caesars and at Harrah's. And obviously, the intention as we began the project was that would be finished prior to peak season of '22 and for -- there's obviously a well-known story of what's happened to -- what happened to supply chain, and we missed the peak season. So really, the results you're seeing in Atlantic City are a function of the construction disruption that we've had going on in that market, that's not a -- we're making a conscious decision to run off revenue and focus on margins. So, Atlantic City on a relative basis to the Regionals was an underperformer. In terms of overperformers, New Orleans has come back quite nicely from both the hurricane and the severe COVID restrictions that were in place in the city, and then Northern Nevada continues to be extraordinarily strong, the levels of business that we're doing in Reno and Tahoe are, frankly, beyond what we ever dreamed when we were putting this thing together a few years ago. Shaun Kelley : And then just as my follow-up, switching to Digital, if I could. While we have Eric, one thing that's been a discussion point in the market is obviously really strong hold levels across much of the OSB landscape in the third quarter, certainly in October -- or sorry, in September. Kind of curious on the thoughts -- you made a call out on hold and that improving a bit over time. Just could you talk to us a little bit about relative to maybe what we're seeing in the market in September and October, how much do you think this is sustainable based on product and mix versus how much is really just a factor of game luck where we've definitely seen some outcomes that have favored the books? Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yes. So, let me start this, and I'll flip to Eric in terms of -- there's two pieces here, right? There's just your normal luck and football season started pretty strong for all books. There's a couple of weeks so far that have been the reverse of that, but the bulk has been favorable to books. But when I'm saying we're positive in October, that's even adjusted for that hold. We've also made a number of changes that have improved our own hold, but I'm going to flip to Eric to talk trough. Brian Agnew : Yes. Thanks, Tom. We had higher-than-expected hold towards the higher end of our range for the quarter, partially, as Tom mentioned, through luck, the football season has been fortunate to us so far. But beyond that, as I mentioned in the remarks, we did put a lot of tools in place. We're increasing our uptime and our percentage of in-play hold and in-play volume, which naturally translates into a higher hold product. In addition, our percentage of parlays has steadily grown and really improved in the third quarter relative to the second and first quarter. A lot of that is due to some enhancements that we made on the tech side to improve the ability for customers to visualize and to place their parlay bets. We also have our analytics team that's come over from the retail casino side that have put together a number of models that allow our traders to be able to keep the odds up during the game longer and then also to be more accurate with respect to their pricing. And so, through a combination of all of those factors, we've really been able to reduce the volatility. And you can see it when we get our results each day, even on days when we're not lucky with the outcomes, we still managed to pull off positive hold or at least hold this reasonable for a particular day. And then when we do get lucky, it really compounds and we can get some really solid, double-digit holds. So overall, we put a lot of structural hold changes in place but we were also a bit lucky in the third quarter. Anthony Carano : We are a huge Phillies fans... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist. Barry Jonas : It looks like you found the right structure to move forward with a bid in New York. Just curious if there are any other greenfield opportunities you're interested in, either domestically or internationally? Tom Reeg : I mean, I would say greenfield international, you never say never, but highly, highly unlikely. In the U.S., if you see a major market open, like, say, Texas, you should expect that we're going to look for a way to participate there. You've seen us in Danville, Virginia, where the temporary will open next year; Columbus, Nebraska, which is smaller where temporary will open next year. So, we will pick and choose, but you should expect it to be domestic focused. Barry Jonas : Got it. Got it. And then, just shifting to Digital. You talked about Ohio and Maryland going live. Any expectations for -- you could share for other jurisdictions, whether that's Massachusetts, Nebraska, Puerto Rico? And then just for iCasino, I think the legislative movement has been softer than people thought. Any progress on states making a push for iCasino that you're seeing? Brian Agnew : Yes, I'll take that one. You definitely listed off a lot of the ones that we're aware of. So, in addition to Maryland, which will hopefully be in November and then Ohio on October 1st, you've also got Massachusetts. The date hasn't been finalized there, but it's looking pretty good for first quarter. It sounds like the retail locations will open first and then online, and we're participating in the online side of that. In addition to Massachusetts, Maine has been moving forward, that's probably going to be late this year, if not into -- sorry, late 2023 rather. We are planning to launch in Puerto Rico that could happen in the fourth quarter or might push to the first quarter. And then, as you mentioned with Nebraska as well, we will plan to have some kiosks up for our temporary casino there. And then we're going to launch a Sportsbook at Casino Windsor, up in Canada, that will be kiosks later this week. And then early next year, we'll open a full book as well. Barry Jonas : Got it. Any movement on the iCasino side that you're starting to see from the states? Brian Agnew : Yes. The iCasino is a little bit more tricky. There really has to be a real coalition. There's a lot of competing interests from both within our industry and ancillary businesses that sometimes compete with us and sometimes participate with us. At this point, it's certainly possible that there could be another state that legalizes or two next year. But I wouldn't call out any particular state at this point. And just to add on to that, when we think about the model that Tom's outlaid, we really don't look at any incremental states from those that have been already passed through the legislation. So anything we get on the iCasino side or even any additional states beyond those that I mentioned would be upside to the model. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John DeCree with CBRE Securities. John DeCree : Covered a lot of ground, so I apologize, maybe this one's a little bit more granular on the October performance in Las Vegas, kind of record EBITDA levels. I think you've mentioned the low-50s percent margin, 52 if I heard correctly. Curious if you could kind of give us a little bit of insight into customer mix I guess typically a bigger group customer quarter, but it seems like everything is kind of working with that margin, I think 12% group room nights in 3Q. Curious if you could kind of unpack October a little bit in terms of customer mix and what kind of pushed that record performance from a customer perspective. Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd prefer not to go super deep there. But yes, John, groups are a big part of it. Group business was strong in October, same as here this week. So it's just a culmination of a significant wave of demand that has included now the group side, and we're thrilled with the way things are coming together. We're going to do over $1 billion cash room revenue in Vegas which -- for those that have been in the market and Caesars would have viewed that as impossible, not that long ago. So, we're really hitting on all cylinders here. John DeCree : Maybe a follow-up for the outlook. I think maybe, Anthony, mentioned that the group room nights are pacing above of \u201819 with some big events next year. Have you started to see the benefit in booking? We all see the kind of pricing for F1, but it's still a bit of ways away, I think, a year now. Curious if you really started to get traction on some of the big events that you expect next year or if you think there's an opportunity to have an acceleration in both group room nights and pricing for next year? Tom Reeg : Yes. Certainly, yes. We think Formula One is kind of a different animal. The demand for that particular event is well beyond what we were expecting and you saw as we rolled out rates yesterday, the pricing is -- reflects that, with a lot of the big events skewed toward the second half of the year beyond normal CES coming back, things like that. There's easy comps in the first quarter with Omicron impacting '21 -- I'm sorry, '22. But as you look further deeper into the bigger groups, it's a little early to talk about traction, but it should all be extremely positive for room rates and occupancy in the market in '22 -- '23, sorry John DeCree : That's great. Thanks Tom. I appreciate the additional color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : I wanted to just go back to the topic I raised I think in last quarter about kind of normalized Las Vegas margins. And I think the discussion we had was around that 50% benchmark. It seems to me that what we saw was some seasonality as well as some of the cost headwinds. Were those attributable to Las Vegas? And if we can maybe take it a step further, that 50% level or neighborhood, is that a full year number implying that some may be higher and 3Q may be lower? Tom Reeg : Yes, that's accurate. And when I was talking about the utility impact, that was entirely Las Vegas. So, you're talking about if you normalize, we should have been between 48%, 49% in third quarter, and then you should see first and fourth quarters should be better than that, second should be somewhere around, let's say high-40s. But again, we manage for aggregate EBITDA, not EBITDA margin. That 50% that we're talking about is really what falls out of the operating model, not necessarily a target for us. David Katz : Understood. So, there was 300 or 400 basis points impact in the current quarter? Tom Reeg : I'd say not quite that much. 46, I said we'd have been 48 to 49, so call it, 200 to 300 basis points. David Katz : Okay. Got it. And if I can ask one other longer-term questions with respect to Digital, and this may not be the way you're thinking about it either. But when we start getting to a more normalized business level for Digital, is there a sort of margin level that makes sense? And I'm just wondering whether it's accretive or dilutive to the aggregate on the Company. Tom Reeg : So, we can see what other mature -- what operators in other mature non-U.S. markets generate in EBITDA margins. We've got a pretty good track record of being a margin leader. So, if you're seeing 25%, 30% away from us, I would expect that ultimately, we're going to do better than that, which should be around in line with the rest of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Politzer with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : Tom, I think on the interactive, you mentioned you still get back to that 50% return on the, call it, $1.1 billion investment. Can you maybe just bridge us from that few hundred million dollars that roll off from the partnerships to how you get to that return? Is it iGaming? Is it sports betting? Is it just general growth of the industry? Tom Reeg : It's -- clearly, the industry is continuing to grow. We know what's happening with our cost structure, what's going to happen with our cost structure, and we make some assumptions on. What we'll be able to do in terms of iGaming as we move forward and very comfortable with that 50% plus return on annual EBITDA to cumulative EBITDA loss measure. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then just moving to the balance sheet. You've certainly been generating some cash and pulling some levers, what additional levers do you have to reduce your debt from here? How topical is Centaur in your mind right now, just given we're coming up on a period where it might become more topical? And any other levers that we should be thinking about to reduce debt in short order? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. So, we should be doing something in the neighborhood, if not, exceeding $1 billion of free cash flow in '23. You should expect that will be used to pay down debt. It has always been our expectation that VICI would choose to exercise the call option it has on the Centaur assets that opened in January of this year. It closes toward the end of '24. So, VICI has been very clear that they anticipate exercising that option for us. If you run that forward and assume they do it toward the end of that period, that should be about a $2.5 billion inflow to us. So, quite substantial. And by then, you'll have -- if we do nothing else, you should have another couple of billion dollars of free cash flow that we've generated between now and then, the vast majority we expect to use to pay down debt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : As a follow-up to your comments on the Digital business hitting the 50% ROI. And I think you said 25% to 30% margins. How important is market share as an input in those assumptions. Or zooming out, how do you think about scale benefits for this business in general? Tom Reeg : We think there's clear benefits to scale in the business. And we expect that we're not going to remain static over time, particularly on the iGaming space. But our -- it's important to me personally that we prove that we can generate the returns that we've laid out for the investment that our shareholders allowed us to make before we're doing any -- let's go out and try to grab significantly more share through promotions. So, you should expect us to be living in this band of market share that we've been living and that market share is ultimately not a target for us. It's can we get the return on investment that we're looking for as in the brick-and-mortar business [Technical Difficulty] share falls out of that. It's not an input. Stephen Grambling : Makes sense. And then one other quick follow-up on, I think you said $1 billion in free cash flow next year. Within that assumption, do you anticipate being a cash taxpayer, excluding any asset sales? And perhaps just in general, when do you expect to be a cash taxpayer? Thanks. Tom Reeg : No, we should not be -- we will not be a cash taxpayer in '23. Bret, do you want to talk? Bret Yunker : Yes, we've got multiple years of runway before we're a taxpayer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Just a quick follow-up on the digital side, whoever wants to take it. But just curious on the iCasino road map that you just sort of started to sort of lay out for us. How should we think about any sort of incremental investment for that revised or new road map? And is that manageable within the existing OpEx that you're currently running in the business? Brian Agnew : Yes. I think as Tom mentioned, this is a really scalable business. And when you're growing at 110% quarter-over-quarter, we are going to continue to staff up to handle state expansions, product improvements, those types of things, but not to the same pace as revenue and not even close to that level. We will have some slight increases in capitalized labor associated with the iCasino product next year. And any impact to the actual P&L will be fairly minimal. Tom Reeg : And from a promo perspective, it's a very different business than sports. So, while you will see some advertising activity around in local market advertising, our casino product, it's a very different scale in terms of launching the sports business. So certainly easily manageable within the numbers that I laid out earlier. Brandt Montour : And then as a follow-up on Las Vegas, I guess no one's asked this macro question, so I might as well take a shot. But Tom, what are you guys seeing in terms of any sensitivity on the part of your fit customers related to the macro? And as a second part of that, as Las Vegas continues to sort of evolve into a more sports friendly destination, what have you seen from sports-focused travelers in terms of gambling habits? And is that something that's a little bit of a concern, or is that something that seems to be in line with other agents in the market? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Brandt, we're -- we see the same macro going forward that others see in terms of here of what happens with continued rate rises that for instance consumer, are we facing a recession. We're not. We're certainly cognizant of what's out there. I can't point you to anything in our business in or out of Vegas that shows any slowdown in the consumer. So, we feel very good. October was obviously very strong. You see the third quarter. We know what investors are anticipating. We're not seeing that in our business to date, nor in the forward metrics that we see -- that we look at in our own business. And then, in terms of sports, sports is digital for us. We are getting over $200 million of incremental brick-and-mortar casino play out of customers that were sourced in digital. That number continues to grow. Sports in Vegas, the Raiders have been very, very good for the city, give us additional length of the stays on weekends that they're in town, generates a lot of incremental travel from visiting teams. So, that's been really a home run from the city's perspective and we've been able to benefit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Just one last follow-up on Vegas. I think we covered pretty much everything out there. But just on the piece with international, the opportunity to kind of bring that back as a tailwind. What do you think it's going to take to get that business back? Is it passage of time? Is it FX related, or is it really just kind of the sports and the holidays that bring in that customer, maybe more on the VIP side? So, when do you think this can kind of inflect . Tom Reeg : Yes. We've just started to see that business start to come back over the last quarter or so. Obviously, this Chinese New Year will be the first without -- knock on wood without impact of the virus and with the ability to travel. So that will be something we're watching closely. As you know, here, we've got Adele starting in middle of November. And like I tell you, she is an enormous draw across the board, but appeals particularly to that international high-end clientele. So we're excited about that. But Chad, it's been 2.5 years at this point, we understand that those people that were coming to Vegas to play, I don't think they stopped gambling. They found other places to do it when travel was impacted, and that's going to be a long road as we build it back. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Joe Stauff with Susquehanna. Joe Stauff : I just had a question. I believe your annual rent adjusts maybe this month or this quarter, what does it -- without the CPI caps, can you just give us what that number adjusts to and from? And just wondering your -- you had mentioned that decision to keep the strip assets and wondering if that changes the way you think about, say, your investments, do you have to now invest maybe in some of those older properties as a result of that? Thank you. Eric Hession : Joe, on the VICI CPI escalator, it's 8.1%, which started on November 1st. And so, rent next year should be around $1.285 billion consolidated, including GLPI. Tom Reeg : And in terms of investment, obviously, Joe, we're doing as much EBITDA as we've ever done here. The particular assets that we're talking about had some low-hanging fruit that we were talking to potential buyers about. You shouldn't be surprised if we take advantage of that in the coming 12 to 18 months. Joe Stauff : Makes sense. Thanks a lot. Tom Reeg : We'll talk to you next quarter. Eric Hession : Thanks a lot, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like to turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We generated fourth quarter EBITDA records in both our Las Vegas and Regional segments during the quarter, and our Digital results continue to show impressive quarterly sequential improvement all year leading to our best performance during Q4. Trends in Las Vegas remained strong during Q4, delivering both 11% revenue and EBITDA growth versus last year. Excluding real rent payments, Las Vegas generated $549 million of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 48%, up 1,000 basis points versus 2019. Occupancy during Q4 was 95.5%, up to pre-COVID levels for the first time since the pandemic. Strong occupancy in ADRs led to records in cash hotel revenues and food and beverage results. Group demand strengthened during Q4 and represented 16% of occupied room nights during the quarter. Our group and convention segment in Las Vegas generated a new EBITDA record in both Q4 and the full year 2022. For the full year, Las Vegas segment generated over 25% growth in both revenues and EBITDA, leading to annual records of approximately $4.3 billion in revenue and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA. While we clearly had a strong year in Las Vegas, we remain optimistic for '23 and beyond. Forward occupancy remains strong and rates are trending ahead of '19. Group and convention paid for 2023 is up to 2019, driven by strong ADRs, higher room nights and higher banquet revenues. The event calendar in Las Vegas continues to strengthen with several high-profile new events entering the market in '23. In our Regional segment in Q4, we delivered $443 million of EBITDA, up 3% versus last year despite the impact of negative weather in December. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, excluding Lake Charles, grew 21% versus 2019, with margins expanding approximately 700 basis points. For the full year, our Regional segment delivered $5.7 billion in revenues and $2 billion in adjusted EBITDA, delivering 34.8% margins. On a same-store basis versus 2019, excluding Lake Charles, our Regional segment delivered 24% EBITDA growth and margins expanded 700 basis points. As we have stated on prior earnings calls, we expect to benefit from several capital investment projects in 2023. Our new land-based Horseshoe Lake Charles property opened late in Q4 2022 to strong demand with initial results exceeding expectations. Temporary casinos in both Danville, Virginia and Columbus, Nebraska remain on track to open by midyear. Renovations in Atlantic City are nearing completion and should be essentially complete ahead of the peak summer season this year. We also expect to benefit from expanded casino offerings in Pompano and Harrah's Hoosier Park this year. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in 2022. Our record results are a reflection of their dedication to delivering exceptional guest service. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Eric Hession for some insights on the fourth quarter and full year performance in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. I'm very pleased with the progress that we made in our Digital business during 2022. If you recall, our objective is to drive a solid return on investment for our shareholders as our business grows and matures over time. Our thesis was grounded on a reasonable TAM and early estimate and effort to build our brand awareness and harvesting the benefits of a very scalable business with a high portion of fixed costs. The key to taking advantage of scale in a mostly fixed cost business is to drive improvements in net revenue. Net revenues for sports and online are primarily determined by a combination of volume, hold and offset by the cost of promotions. I'm pleased that in Q4 year-over-year, our volume was up 7%, hold up 100 basis points and promotional expense down 43%. The combination of these three metrics resulted in us reporting the highest quarterly net revenue results to date growing by over 100% year-over-year and the smallest adjusted EBITDA loss since rebranding to Caesars Sportsbook in August of 2001. On the sports betting side, we continued to focus our product and technology improvements on the overall experience for our customers. They responded very favorably to the improved in-game parlay product enhancements, the in-game wagering improvements, streaming technology and the introduction of live scores. During the quarter, we also started to see the results of our segmented marketing campaigns that allow us to reward customers more directly for their loyalty and play. As referenced earlier, these efforts were direct contributors towards our net revenue growth as they allowed us to improve our promotional spending efficiency. We anticipate continued enhancements in this critical area over the course of 2023. On the Isle Casino side, work is well underway toward creating a significantly improved product experience for our customers that will be rolled out in the second half of 2023. The new product experience will also include enhanced marketing capabilities, such as segmented and life cycle triggered offers, which we currently do not have for iGaming. In the meantime, we continue to add new content, which has been well received. iGaming remains a critical component of our digital growth strategy for 2023 and beyond. From an expansion standpoint, in Q4, we opened retail locations in Puerto Rico and Kansas and launched online sports betting in Maryland. In addition, on January 1, we launched sports betting online in Ohio and retail. We now offer sports betting in 29 North American jurisdictions, 21 of which offer mobile wagering. We plan to launch our mobile sports app in Massachusetts later this week to accept registrations and deposits. And pending final regulatory approvals, we anticipate accepting wagers starting in mid-March. I'll now pass the call to Bret for some additional comments on Q4 and the full year. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Consistent with our historical track record, we continued to aggressively reduce debt in the fourth quarter by paying down over $200 million from free cash flow, bringing our full year debt reduction to $1.2 billion. Our leverage also came down significantly during 2022 and now stands at just under 4.5x on a traditional debt-to-EBITDA basis or mid 5x rent adjusted. Alongside a one-notch rating upgrade from Moody's in January, we refinanced $4.5 billion of debt at highly attractive rates, roughly half of which came in the form of 7% fixed rate notes, further decreasing our exposure to short-term rate hikes from the Fed. Our next debt maturity is over 2.5 years away. 2022 CapEx spend, excluding AC, came in at just under $800 million, which remains our expectation for 2023. Our plan includes $300 million of maintenance CapEx and $500 million of growth capital. As of December 31, we had Federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 billion, which will continue to shield operating income in 2023 and well beyond. We averaged just over $1 billion of annual debt reduction over the past two years, which sets a nice target for us to achieve yet again in 2023. I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. And on the financing piece, I know these calls end up skewing to the equity markets, I want to thank our banks and our credit investors. We've been at this for about nine years now as a public entity and have gone through a series of acquisitions, a series of financings. And every time we ask the debt markets to step up for us, you step up and strengthen numbers well beyond expectations; in this case, allowed us to upsize by $1 billion and start dealing with '25 maturities. In advance of when we expected, know that, that's not taken for granted that we really do appreciate you believing in us each time we come to market. You should expect that we'll be back to deal with the remaining '25 maturities at some point after the call steps -- the calls step down in the middle of this year. In terms of operating results for the quarter since we already pre-released, I'll make a few comments on last quarter, but I'll focus on what's going -- what's going on in January and February so far. In Digital, as you saw in our results, we were nearly breakeven. Our well-publicized MLB exposure around the World Series was about a $30 million swing. So on a hold-adjusted basis, we are well into the positive in the fourth quarter. First quarter, we launched Ohio. Given the launch cost there, you should expect a modest loss in the first quarter. But we're anticipating that Digital on a full year basis will be an EBITDA contributor for us this year. And when I say that, I'm talking about overall and both verticals, I expect sports betting and iGaming to be EBITDA positive this year for us. When we started this Digital launch about a little over 1.5 years ago, we told you that cumulative EBITDA losses would be something north of $1 billion. Looks like they're going to finish at somewhere a little over $1.1 billion. We expect at maturity that we\u2019ll generate in excess of 50% of that in annual EBITDA out of the Digital business. That has not changed at all from when we launch remains in our sites. We'd expect to be generating that level of EBITDA full year of '25. We're hopeful we'll be run rating at least a quarter or two in '24 at those levels. So the switch to getting out of brand building, getting out of advertising in terms of big expense of commercial, as you noticed you didn't see us at the Super Bowl, but more importantly, the granular changes in individual marketing have slowed dramatically. This is the quarter when we launched New York and Louisiana last year. So you're going to see over $0.5 billion of trailing EBITDA losses in Digital disappear this quarter. January alone, on a consolidated basis EBITDA improved over $450 million for the month. So obviously, there's going to be a significant change in trailing credit statistics that we're excited for. In the brick-and-mortar arena, the business remains exceedingly strong. Consumers continues to spend. Regionals continue to do well. The only thing I can point to really in terms of weakness is weather related in the fourth quarter. I peg about $20 million of lost EBITDA in December, primarily in the Midwest, but kind of throughout the Regional business. First quarter, you've got Northern Nevada has been inundated with snow. It's the worse winter in about 70 years. So the -- you've got a little bit of impact there. But despite that, our Regional business grew in the fourth quarter. It continues to grow in the first quarter. And as Anthony said, we have pieces that are coming online that will add to that. I was at the Lake Charles opening in December. Really pleased with the way that product turned out. If you look at how it's been doing since opening, I'd expect that our incremental EBITDA on the spend is going to be in excess of 25% on a gross basis. But recall that we had insurance proceeds there from the disruption of the original property. So on a net basis, our ROI there should be approaching 50%. So extraordinarily strong in Lake Charles. We're excited that we've got temporary casinos coming in Danville, Nebraska. We've got the Indiana project coming online in the back half of the year. The Atlantic City spend largely done, should be done by the time we hit prime season. So really excited for the way '23 sets up for us from a regional basis. Vegas, it's hard to express how strong Vegas is right now. Occupancy in January for us was up over 1,700 basis points versus Omicron impacted '22. We're off to on a consolidated basis and in Vegas, in particular, an exceedingly strong start to the first quarter. But recall that in the first quarter, the back half of the quarter tends to be more important than the front half. But as we look at forward bookings in Vegas, they're strong and getting stronger. March sets up to be one of the best months that we've ever had in Las Vegas. Forward bookings are strong, group attrition is declining so that we are now seeing group business in excess of 2019 numbers for the first time it looks that way going forward and all of our forward indicators for booking look very strong. So as we sit here today, it feels -- the business feels fantastic. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Tom, just wanted to dig a little deeper into your Las Vegas Strip group and convention commentary. Based on pace and/or what is booked presently, can you talk about room nights by quarter for this year and how it compares to each of the quarters in 2022, really kind of focusing more on the second quarter and the second half of this year, so I could understand the first quarter strength? Tom Reeg : So I don't know that I want to get into that level of granularity in terms of quarter-by-quarter, I'd tell you that right now, we are high single-digit percentage points above 2019 levels. Recall that we never reached 2019 levels in '22. Obviously, the back half of the year from a calendar basis, citywide sets up very strong. So we feel very good about group business in '23. Joe Greff : Great. And can you talk a little bit about F1 later this year in November and how much you think that can be in terms of incremental EBITDA and maybe what it can generate in the 4Q? There seems to be the expectations all over the place, but is it something that could contribute say, relative to what you just reported in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas, an incremental 5% of EBITDA, all other -- all things being equal? Tom Reeg : Yes, Joe, I think that's certainly possible. The important thing is when it happens. So I would be -- I'm expecting Super Bowl level activity, if not stronger. But if you lost the Super Bowl in February, you're still going to have a strong weekend. There's obviously incremental lift from the Super Bowl. But when you're talking about in November, that's our softest period of the year. So the lift is far more dramatic on a year-over-year basis. So yes, I'd be looking at for us something along those lines, 5% or better in terms of EBITDA lift for the quarter that's driven by that weekend. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Bret, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about leverage right now? And when -- what the time line kind of looks like until you believe you could more or less achieve kind of where you want to be on a static basis going forward? Bret Yunker : Yes. And again, the Digital losses are coming out. We got upgraded by Moody's. So we're mid-5x rent adjusted. With Digital and collecting positive, but that will come down. So we expect to be below the 4x gross rent adjusted target by the end of '24. Carlo Santarelli : And is that where you guys will comfortably kind of run the business going forward? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd expect that we're going to -- will be a significant free cash flow generator still. So I don't think that ends the deleveraging. But yes, we want to be sub-4x levered that's been consistent since we closed the Caesars transaction. Carlo Santarelli : Great. And then, Tom, if I can follow up on the more or less kind of 550 target EBITDA from the Digital business. To the extent you're willing to share, how do you kind of think about the split between the OSB side and the iCasino side? And obviously, I imagine that estimate assumes the second half of this year with a lot of the rollouts that you're doing on the iCasino side, that business provides a pretty healthy growth in the '24 and beyond? Tom Reeg : Yes, that's true, Carlo. I prefer not to get super granular I'd say, the mix in that 550-plus number will lean towards sports betting, but is on a per state basis, obviously, iGaming is overrepresented. Operator : Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. Barry Jonas : Tom, are you surprised at how resilient the consumer has been? Anything you think could explain it? And then just as a follow-up, as you think about digital versus land-based players, where do you expect to see more recession or macro resistance? Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean, I don't -- I'm no economist. So I don't know that I'm surprised by what's happening. I think we lock people up in their homes to for some period of time throughout the country. And then we're comparing periods of time that are not apples-to-apples because that's never happened before. So I don't know if you think about how lives have been reordered in terms of time as an example. There's less working from an office, there's more working remotely. We've always viewed these businesses as the limiting factor was cash. If your customer didn't have -- your customer your business is going to fluctuate based on how much cash your customer has. Obviously, that's going to have significant correlation. I don't know if time was a limiting factor as well, that people can now spend time doing things that they enjoy longer than they could before because they're not commuting to a city center, and they're not spending the money to do that. But all I can tell you is what we see in the business is continued strength and where you know we're up against strong comps going back for a few quarters now, and we're still growing. So with all the handing over what will happen, I expect when we do get a turn in the cycle, I'm expecting a normal business cycle recession where you get a substitution effect two regional properties out of destination, but we certainly don't see anything in our destination business today that suggests that, that's on the horizon. Barry Jonas : That's great. And then just a follow-up was I'm curious to get your thoughts on the digital versus the land-based player. Obviously, there's some overlap. But as you think about a recession or some macro hits which player do you think would be more resistant? Tom Reeg : I mean that's another -- that's more uncharted territory. The answer is we don't know, suspect that the digital player is more just money if you're looking at money versus time constrained, I suspect the digital player is more -- leans toward money as they achieve constraint and brick-and-mortar is a mix. But how will they behave in a downturn? I don't know that there's enough difference between the two to say you're going to see a significant divergence. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : Tom, I don't think you mentioned in your prepared remarks -- and I know you said besides weather, there's nothing you can really point to in terms of consumer weakness. But maybe can you provide us any comments around what you've seen from unrated play and maybe how that's fared recently? And have there been any material changes in your -- the spend patterns across your database peers, meaning that low tier rated player? Has there been any softness there? I would assume the answer is probably no, though. Toms Reeg : Yes. Your last question, there is -- no. In terms of unrated, you saw -- we saw a material step down in unrated as we anniversaried stimulus, but that's behind us now. And you've seen the results, including the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. So unrated kind of peaked when stimulus checks were going out. rated continues to behave strongly and on rate still is holding in after that initial stepped up. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. Second question, and look, I'm not even sure this is even relevant, but we've gotten this question a couple of times from investors. And is there any way to help us understand if there's any impact we need to think about around the William Hill malfunctioned in Nevada around the Super Bowl? Or is that kind of over and done with at this point? Tom Reeg : That's over and done with. That's a technology issue. We're running Nevada on old technology, not Liberty. Liberty needs approval. It's actually the PAM provider that needs approval. We expect that relatively soon, and so we expect Nevada to be on Liberty for next football season. So that's certainly not something that we were -- that we enjoyed while it was going on, but it's in the rearview mirror at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from David Bain with B. Riley. David Bain : Great. First, I was hoping we can get a little bit more granular on the potential iCasino ramp in the back half. Just trying to get an idea of major tech improvements like sufficient slot content for churn when that kicks in, how important that is? Maybe any other major catalysts that move the needle in terms of share there because certainly doesn't look like with the EBITDA guidance -- and thank you for that by the way, it doesn't seem like that includes a lot of big cash promotional push. Eric Hession : Yes. Maybe I'll jump in and take this one, David. So the big change that we're going to make is to have a standalone casino app. So right now, if you want to play on the casino, you have to go download the sports betting app and then find the casino icon, click on it and go through the casino. We'll also be offering a casino app that then you can do the same thing and go back to the sports betting side, but it will be much easier to use from a customer perspective who's looking just for the casino side. We'll also be creating some branded live table games in the various states more so than we have right now. We'll also be introducing the ability to do segmented and triggered marketing. So much like if you recall, a year ago, we were unable to do that on the sports betting side. We're now able to do segmentation on the sports betting side, but we're not on the casino side. And so we're unable to use the learnings from the years' and years' experience we have on the brick-and-mortar side on the iCasino side. And so we'll be having that come along as well. From a games content perspective, that's something we can address now. And so what you'll see is over the next say two to three months, we'll be making steady releases, adding more games, particularly on the iOS side where we don't have as many as on the Android side. So the game content will be coming along. We'll be adding custom table games that are branded as Caesars, but the big changes will be the segmented marketing the ability to do triggered life cycle journeys and then the stand-alone app that you'll see in the second half. David Bain : Okay. Awesome. And then just kind of -- I think this will bleed into Eric, your comments just now, but Tom, in the past, you've given us data points on land-based contributions from online, I believe, sometime last year around this time, it was $150 million of high-margin revenue. Could we get an update on how that's trending now? And in terms of the omnichannel marketing approach, are there some specific plans you can share to sort of ramp that for more valuable customer acquisition and loyalty? Tom Reeg : Yes, Dave. So I want to get out of updating that number. You should assume that it continues to grow. It's our rewards database that we're leaning on in this business more and more as time goes on. States open and every customer is up for grabs we're in there. But as states mature, what you see us doing is leaning into our rewards database and bringing those new customers into our database and we're seeing a lot of cross-market play. I get -- anecdotally, I get a report of big winners and losers in both sports and iGaming every day. And a year ago, there was -- the report will show their brick-and-mortar history, and this is particularly true in iCasino. You didn't see a lot of correlation between big iGaming players and brick-and-mortar players. And now you're seeing -- if it's 25 people on the sheet every day, 20 of them have significant brick-and-mortar history. So you can see it continuing to build through the reward system, which is exactly what we were hoping would happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Politzer with Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : First, on Las Vegas. I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the room night mix in 2023 versus 2022. I know you mentioned that you'd have record group and convention mix. But I guess -- what's kind of the cohort that this is coming out of? And how should we think about the relative profitability of the group versus casino versus the lead customer as it kind of shifts versus year last year? Tom Reeg : Yes. You're seeing group come in increase over '22 at the expense of OTA and lower-end FIT business. So you're getting a dramatic lift in rate. That customer is going to skew more toward non-gaming offerings. So you'll have some impact on casino revenue. But overall, your -- in some cases, particularly in -- early in this quarter, you're filling a room that was unfilled last year. As you move through the year, you're basically trading up to a more valuable customer. And while their mix of spend may be a little different, their profitability is significantly higher than what they're replacing. Daniel Politzer : Got it. And then for Digital, is there any way you could help us bridge a little bit. We're going from 2023 kind of modestly positive, a big jump into 2024 and then an even more significant jump in 2025. Is that some of these larger longer tiered deals kind of coming out of the business? Or is it just a ramp or new states? Or any way to help us better understanding moving pieces there? Tom Reeg : Sure. Yes, it's all of the above. So it's continued momentum from what we're doing here. You've got a business that's growing organically and has added a bunch of states, some more recently than others. We're -- there doesn't appear to be a huge new state pipeline coming on. Obviously, we've got a significant ramp expected in iGaming as we get into back half of '23. And then you do have all of that, the original partnerships that were stuck in that should be rolling off starting in '24, '25 on and some of the chunkier ones that flow directly to EBITDA as they run off. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : I just want to follow up on that last question around online. Could you help us just give us any thoughts on kind of the underlying margin structure there? A number of people who have given some formal targets that talked about a 30% overall style contribution margin, what would be underlying the targets that you kind of laid out as you start to get out into '24 and '25? Would it be to that? Can you do even better given some of your own in-house capabilities? Just kind of how would you think about the puts and takes relative to some of the margin goals that have been put out there by others? Tom Reeg : Yes. So without giving a target, we've got an advantage against some others in terms of we own all of our licenses, we think we've got a customer acquisition cost advantage tying into our database against all, to some degree, but some significant advantage there. We think that sports will be lower margin than iGaming, but that both will be material margin, and we have a long history of performing well on a margin basis, on a relative basis, and we would expect that to be the same in Digital as it's been in the brick and mortar. Shaun Kelley : Got it. And then sort of just wanted to pivot on the land-based side, too, maybe just the cost environment a little bit. We're starting to hear a number of operators on the hotel side, talk a little bit more about sort of cumulative inflation over the last three and four years. A little bit of a different animal in Vegas. I know Caesars has a decent amount of union contract as well, which probably provides some visibility. But can you just discuss about the overall labor and hiring environment and then specifically maybe drill in on any upcoming union contracts and how that might -- how any negotiation there might impact the operating expense? Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'd say we have been dealing with labor cost inflation since the reopening. We've got the -- or the Nevada union contracts are up in the middle of this year. We've begun discussions with the unions and to put it plainly, we're doing well. We've been doing well. Our employees should do well. So we've built into our analysis. We expect labor cost inflation through this new union contract in the back half, starting in the back half of '23. And with what we've got going on in the business, we think we'll be able to navigate that just fine. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Just starting out with Las Vegas on the pace that you gave, Tom, I was wondering if you be kind enough to break that out into volume versus rate? I know you said rates were up. And what I'm getting at is the broader hotel world in the U.S. is still seeing a lot of in the year for the year volumes being booked. And so I'm curious how much upside do you think there is on that front in Vegas this year? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Brandt, we've seen a significant lift in demand as we measure it in terms of forward bookings in the last few weeks. As I said, March is setting up for one of the strongest months we've had certainly from a rate and occupancy standpoint. As you get toward the back half of the year, you're comping against quarters where we were full, so you're going to see more of a rate lift. It's really the first half of the year that has benefited in filling in occupancy that wasn't there in '22, primarily midweek. Brandt Montour : That's great. And then a question about iGaming. And Tom, I'm curious, when you think about that market, and you think about your company's aspirations for growing that -- your business there in the second half. Do you think that you can do that by growing the overall market by engaging in your -- with your database and things that you can do there? Or is there a significant amount of your lift going to come from gaining share from other operators in your mind? Tom Reeg : I think it will be a mix of both that will tap into our own network, but that also there will be some market share gain as well. You've seen even in this environment where we've not been aggressive at all from a promotional perspective. I'd go back and look at what's happened in Illinois market share for us. You see us continuing to class share. We're certainly still nothing to write home about. But when you give the customers a better product, we've got a lot of customers that are that lean towards doing business with us if we've got the right product. And we think that we're going to be there shortly, and we'd expect similar experience. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Eric, you mentioned hold was up, I believe, 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. And I'm guessing that was a combination of game outcomes, but probably more importantly, game mix with single game parlays and the like. Can you kind of help us think about structurally what's happening with withhold, kind of where your single game parlay and maybe in-play product is against where you want to be and maybe your peers, and if you think this will have a positive outcome for 2023, particularly as we get deeper into the year? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. You're right. It was, I would say, mostly structural changes that we made, there was definitely a favorable outcome on some key sporting events. But one of the things we measure is multi wager tickets. So like it could be same game parlays or multi-game parlays or however that you -- the customer wants to bet. And those -- the percentage of those as a function of our overall bets is steadily rising. This is kind of the third year that we have good data on it. And we're continuing to see improvements. And as you know, the hold in those products are much higher. We've also done a better job merchandising it. So if you go on our app now, you'll see we have pre-canned parlays, so they're effectively prebuilt. Right now, they're the same for everybody. But in the future, we'll be able to use some segmented marketing to display different pre-canned parlays, which I think will be really -- customers will be really receptive to that. We also have boosts that we offer on the tiles across the top and the boosts are well received by the customers. And those also help improve the hold overall for the product. In addition, we've made a number of changes on our trading team. We now have the trading team organized by sport. We fully separated from the William Hill team, and we also have the modeling being done for the most part now in-house. So our analytics team has built a lot of the models that we use for in-play trading, which also helps have more customization for our position with the book, but it also just over time, will help our whole percentages. Chad Beynon : And then separately, can you just update us on in terms of the size and scope, I guess, the spend in New York for a land-based casino and maybe the timing for that opportunity when we'll find out the next steps? Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'd say spend to date has been modest. We see the same documents that you see that suggests they're looking to award something by the end of the year, but there's a potential cut through the location boards of the various properties that's upcoming in the next quarter or so. We continue to believe we've got the project that will open the quickest. We'll start paying New York, the tax is the quickest. It's in an area that doesn't need zoning approval. Obviously, is already tourist-focused but I can assure you, we are not going to be the one that wins because we built the biggest housing development outside of our casino. We're going to win this on the merits of the property and how quickly we can get open and how well it fits into the local environment. If it becomes an arm's race of who is going to spend the most money, we won't win. Operator : Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE Securities. John DeCree : Maybe two easy ones. Tom, maybe if you could give us a little bit of insight on how we should think about the seasonality in Las Vegas this year? Obviously, the last couple of years have been pretty noisy. 2Q and 4Q in 2022 were your largest quarters. Obviously, I think 2Q has some benefit from 1Q trips being deferred, but curious if you can give some insight for this year. Tom Reeg : Yes. I would say you should expect a more normal year of seasonality in Vegas this year where early in the year, your soft ramp up in the kind of right about now in the first quarter, and that goes until it gets really hot here. Third quarter is the seasonal slowest point. Fourth quarter, you've got November is typically your slowest month of the year, but that's when F1 will hit this year. So I think you get that bump that we talked about earlier in Joe's question. John DeCree : Got it. That's helpful. And then 4Q in Las Vegas, I think maybe Anthony's prepared remarks, you mentioned 16% or 17%, I forget, which group room nights is relatively high for you guys. Is that the right level that you guys think you'll be at on an annualized basis going forward? Or is there more upside? Or what's the right mix as you think about your kind of customer segments? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd expect with full-on group business with FORUM operating, I think you should expect us to continue to creep higher into the high teens in terms of percentage of overall room next year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : I wanted to go back to the subject of prospective asset sales and where you think the credit markets are in terms of support for that, both within and perhaps outside any pre-existing put calls or ROFRs, et cetera? Tom Reeg : We are not active in that market, so I can't speak with first-hand knowledge. I'd tell you today would have been a tough day to try to do something. But we were -- the deal that we did in January by a number of metrics was one of the largest ones that's happened in the credit markets generally and certainly in gaming in quite a while. So I wouldn't describe it as credit markets are wide open. At this point, they have been getting better, but in an environment where the Fed is still raising, it's still a dicey environment where you got to pick your spots. David Katz : Understood. So if we can just sort of focus on the potential opportunities that are contractual obligations. Are those factored into your thinking for this year and next? I know Bret talked about getting to a leverage level by the end of next year that I think was sub 4 was suggested, if I heard correctly? Tom Reeg : Yes, we're presuming that -- we're presuming that those proceeds would -- they add lease adjusted debt, they'd be used to pay off conventional debt so that that would be -- that wouldn't change the net result materially. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : As a clarification, I believe I heard Bret mention the $1.2 billion in debt reduction this year could be repeated next year. Is that the rough math to think about free cash flow for 2023? And how should we generally be thinking about ROI investment versus maintenance CapEx in the year ahead? Bret Yunker : Yes. That's free cash flow. So no asset sales for '23. And what was the second question about maintenance CapEx ROI? Stephen Grambling : Yes. Is there just any maintenance -- can you split basically how you're thinking about maintenance CapEx versus ROI investments in 2023 as well? Bret Yunker : I said, 300 and 500. Tom Reeg : Yes. So 500 growth; 300, maintenance. Stephen Grambling : Got it. And then as a follow-up on Digital, how are you thinking about new states legalizing in capturing the 50% ROI run rate in 2024? Tom Reeg : We don't assume anything beyond what's known to the markets today. So we're not anticipating there's a big state shoe that's going to drop. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks, everyone. We'll talk to you at the end of the quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony Carano. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We had a strong start to 2023 in the first quarter. Our Las Vegas segment delivered a Q1 EBITDA and EBITDA margin record and our regional segment reported a strong quarter, excluding weather disruptions in Northern Nevada. In addition, our Digital segment was nearly breakeven, despite launching sports betting in two states during the quarter. Trends in Las Vegas remained strong during Q1, delivering 24% revenue growth and 33% EBITDA growth versus last year. Excluding real rent payments, Las Vegas generated $544 million of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 48%, up 300 basis points versus last year. Occupancy during Q1 was 95% versus 83% the prior year. Strong occupancy and ADRs led to record in cash hotel revenues and food and beverage results. Our Group and Convention segment also delivered an all-time EBITDA record in Q1 and represented 21% of occupied rooms during the quarter, setting a new quarterly record for convention mix. Our forward outlook for the Group and Convention segment remained exceptionally strong, driven by a continued combination of increasing room nights, higher ADRs and strong banquet revenues. In our Regional segment, we delivered 2% revenue growth and a 2% decline in adjusted EBITDA versus last year. As Tom will discuss in more detail, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by severe winter weather in Northern Nevada. However, trends outside of Northern Nevada remained strong during the quarter, delivering EBITDA growth year-over-year. We remain encouraged by the early returns we're seeing on recently-completed capital projects, including the expansion and the rebrand of Horseshoe, Indianapolis, the expansion and rebrand Harrah's Pompano Beach and the new land-based Horseshoe Lake Charles. The success of these projects gives us further confidence in the return potential of our ongoing growth projects. We remain on track to open a temporary facility in Danville, Virginia on May 15th and in Columbus, Nebraska by the end of Q2. Our expansion at Harrah's Hoosier Park is slated to open in Q3 of this year. The majority of our CapEx spend in AC is nearing completion and we're looking forward to launching our new entertainment offerings THE HOOK by Spiegelworld this summer. Work on our $430 million expansion in New Orleans continues and is slated to be completed towards the end of 2024. And finally, we announced yesterday that we are transforming the former Jubilee Tower at Horseshoe, Las Vegas and to the new Versailles Tower at Paris, Las Vegas. This $100 million rebrand and upgrade is included in our 2023 capex plans and slated to be completed this year. We're off to a great start in '23 and I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in this first quarter. Our results are a reflection of their dedication to delivering exceptional guest service and experiences. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric for some insights on the first quarter in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. During the first quarter of 2023, we delivered a dramatic improvement in the performance of our Digital segment versus the prior year. Our business nearly broke-even during the quarter on $238 million of net revenues versus a $554 million EBITDA loss in last year, which was impacted by significant brand-related spending and state launches in New York and Louisiana. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted promotional investment within our existing customer base as well as customers located in the new states that we launched this quarter, Ohio and Massachusetts. I'm pleased with the progress we have delivered over the last 12 months. Our net revenues continue to increase significantly as we launch new states, grow and retain our existing customer base and continue to deliver exciting product improvements. On that front, we will be executing three significant tech enhancements to our platform during the remainder of the year. First starting early in the third quarter, we will be launching a new standalone iCasino app this exciting addition to our product offering will allow us to drive better customer engagement through a dedicated application with a focus on increased game content, which will include new proprietary offerings and improved marketing capabilities. Second, we expect to begin testing our in-house player account management system later this year, which will ultimately lead to a shared wallet that we anticipate rolling out in 2024. And finally, we expect to migrate all of our operations in Nevada to our Liberty tech stack ahead of the 2023 football season. From an EBITDA perspective, our net revenues are now at a scale where we are able to roughly breakeven and cover the costs of our proprietary technology. We expect that our year-over-year net revenues will continue to grow each quarter. And given the effectiveness of our expense management plan will drive extremely high flow-through on each incremental dollar. From an expansion standpoint, after our most recent launches in Q1, we now offer sports betting in 30 North American jurisdictions, 22 of which we offer mobile wagering. And in addition, we offer iCasino in five jurisdictions. I'll now pass the call over to Bret for some additional comments. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Given the outstanding progress being made in our digital segment, which is now fully self-funded, we have the ability to sweep all brick-and-mortar cash flow toward debt reduction. Today, we announced that we fully repaid the 8% $400 million Forum Convention Center loan due 2025, resulting in $32 million of annual interest expense savings and enhanced free cash flow. Our capex plans for 2023 remain unchanged, with the planned spend of $800 million, including $500 million of growth and $300 million of maintenance. Leverage on a traditional and rent- adjusted basis continues to decline as we repay debt and grow EBITDA with traditional net leverage just over 4 times and rent adjusted leverage just over 5 times. We continue to target the third consecutive year of $1 billion of permanent debt reduction. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. Thanks, everybody for joining today. To go a little deeper into the numbers, Vegas, was very near a quarterly -- all-time quarterly record, it was a Q1 EBITDA and margin record and it was a record for mix in the group business 21%. Recall that Caesars' pre-merger was running at about 14%. And so what we're seeing -- what you're seeing through Vegas is not only just extraordinary demand that continues as you look through each month. You're seeing the average customer in our property continuing to be -- continuing to raise. We're getting group business that is higher dollar comes with banquet business attached and replaces our least profitable players. So it's a virtuous cycle in Vegas, as we sit here today. Obviously, second quarter generally is our most difficult comp of the year, since that was our all-time record. Second quarter last year we did almost $1.50 billion of brick-and-mortar EBITDA, but we feel very good about business in April and through the rest of this quarter in Vegas. And as you look forward with the Group business that's on the books going forward, we did announced $100 million project to change the Bally's Jubilee Tower to the Versailles Tower in Paris. It will be connected by a physical bridge into the property. Paris has really exploded as we've improved the casino floor and added a number of high-end food and beverage options, including Nobu, the Bedford and Vanderpump. And room rates at -- both room rate and spend -- non-gaming spend per room at Paris are significantly ahead of where they are at Horseshoe. So we think this will be a high ROI and more importantly, high-conviction in that ROI project that is in design stages now and should begin shortly. Regional, if I touch on regional for a moment. The Tahoe area, Northern Nevada about 720 inches of snow, so 60 feet of snow in the quarter. Unfortunately for us, a lot of those storms hit Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So even with that amount of snow, you can get lucky as to when it hits, we did not. So weather in Northern Nevada cost about $20 million of EBITDA in the quarter. So if you normalize for weather in the quarter, regional EBITDA and margin both would have been up slightly. We've got a number of exciting projects there that I'll touch on as they get a little deeper, I'll circle back to that. In Digital, we were about a $3.5 million loss that was with the launches of Massachusetts and Ohio. And the Super Bowl that didn't hold very well for us, frankly, given the amount of scoring that happened in it. Really if any of those three legs were not a part of the quarter, we were positive. As we sit here today, we are positive on a year-to-date basis. In Digital, I told you last quarter we anticipate that we will generate positive EBITDA for the year 2023. I can tell you today, we're already there on a year-to-day basis and the amount of EBITDA that I was expecting, when we announced that we'd be positive for the year about 90-days ago versus where we are today, we think we'll do considerably better than where we thought we were even 90 days ago. And something that comes up in Digital and conversations with investors is I suppose from our peers, the GE. It's just Nevada. I want to be clear that non-Nevada as a piece of Digital and I'm not going to get super specific. But more than 80% of our Digital business is non-Nevada. And we will be EBITDA-positive this year, we remain on track to generate the 50% return on the $1.1 billion of cumulative losses that we generated, as we launched the business. I still expect that to be a 2025 event, with the hope that we're run rating that level by the fourth quarter of '24. So I want to get out of -- I know these calls tend to focus on right now next 90-days. I want to -- I want you guys to know how do I think of the business from a longer-term perspective and I want to couch this with this as not guidance, as most of you know, I'm pretty transparent. So this is what I see today. When we took over Caesars, the assets that we own today the brick-and-mortar assets, we're doing $2.9 billion of trailing EBITDA. As we look post first quarter, the Vegas business LTM EBITDA Vegas alone is a little over $2.1 billion. Regional is a little less than $2 billion. When you run through managed and corporate, we're right at about $4 billion of EBITDA from the same assets that we're doing $2.9 billion prior to the merger. We've got about $2.4 billion of operating cost, cash outflows between rent, cash interest expense, maintenance CapEx, so about $250 million shares outstanding that's about $750 of free cash flow per share as we sit here today. The Digital business for now seven months is about breakeven. So obviously inflecting to positive. We've told you what we expect that to do through \u201825. In that same timeframe, I think we've got a similar amount of incremental EBITDA that will come through the brick-and-mortar business. So, piece of that is -- piece of that are the projects that Anthony touched upon, you've got the Lake Charles expansion that opened in December. So we're still in the first-half of the first year post that reopening. We've got the Pompano project where the racetrack came out of the business. We expanded the Casino, we will start to see the JV development begin in earnest, it's already in earnest around the property, but you'll start to see pieces come online. We've got the Atlantic City spend, which is largely in the rearview mirror. This summer is the first prime period where we will not be significantly disrupted on our floors from those projects. So we're optimistic there. We've got the Hoosier Park expansion in Indianapolis, which is again a high probability, high ROI project mirrors what we did, of course, Indianapolis where we have seen returns in excess of 30% on that capital would expect a similar outcome in that Hoosier Park. And then you've got New Orleans, which is over $400 million. That will come online before the Super Bowl of \u201825. So towards the end of \u201924, that's going to transform that property into a Caesars, a number of high-end restaurants. You've got a Caesars Tower that will be dropped right in the middle of the Casino. You've got a number of high-end food and beverage offerings, you've got third-party development across the street of Four Seasons Hotel open across the street within the last 12 months. So we're excited about what's possible there. So I think what we're looking at if you look out to \u201825, in my view, is a company that could be pushing toward $5 billion of EBITDA. As Bret said, we paid down $400 million mortgage note on the Forum Convention Center yesterday. That puts us on-track to pay-down over $1 billion of debt for the third consecutive year. I would expect \u201824 and \u201825 to look the same. So again, as we sit here today, you're at $22 billion-ish of lease-adjusted debt. That $4 billion of EBITDA with Digital flat. So you got about 5.5 times leverage. Just from what we do organically in the business, as I described that debt balance should get down to $18 billion and $19 billion against the $5 billion. So you're looking at -- in that scenario, you're paying down effectively 7% debt, $1 billion a year for three years. You're going to have some increase in the lease payment stream, but you're talking about $150 million less in cash outflows, $1 billion more in cash inflows. So you're looking more like $12.50 or more a share in cash flow. None of those assumptions in my mind seem particularly aggressive. I think we can generate an incremental $0.5 billion out of the brick-and-mortar given the momentum that we have in the business and I think we're going to do better than that. In Digital, and if you think of where that comes in Digital, I think you've got three legs of the stool and a third of it and they'll roughly be a third, a third, a third. You've got the existing sports-betting business continues to get more profitable, volumes continue to increase and you should expect that continues to drive positive EBITDA, that's the bulk of what's happening as you see us inflect the positive. Eric talked about the iGaming app that we will launch early in the third quarter. We're particularly excited about that, that's going to improve in particular our slot business in iGaming, because our existing portal is through a sports-betting app, our existing iCasino business leans toward tables more than our peers and iGaming forward app is going to change that for us. If we get our iGaming share to equal our sports-betting share that's going to be that third of the boost in EBITDA. And then as we've talked about numerous times, we've got partnership and talent agreements that come up in the next, let's call it, 12 months to 24 months that we expect will be the third leg of that stool that gets us to $500 million plus. Every time I speak to you, I'm more confident in those numbers. And every time I speak to you, we've outperformed where I thought we would have been 90-days ago. So that's obvious, thanks for indulging me to think longer-term, because I know we're going to get right back into what's the consumer doing right now and two weeks from now. And what I'll tell you is we continue to see significant strength across all of our assets with extraordinary strength in Las Vegas. So, we are exceedingly optimistic about the road ahead. We're particularly proud of the quarter that we just posted, so the idea that -- if you add back the 20 in Northern Nevada that we were nearly $1 billion in EBITDA in the first quarter, which is not typically a seasonal strong point. I'm really pleased and proud of what our team and our employees have delivered and look forward to the rest of the year. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, Tom. Everybody, thank you for the remarks. Tom, when you talked about kind of being positive year-to-date in digital and positive for the year, kind of, an odd-sounding question, but from where we are today, do you expect to remain positive through the year? Will we see a 3Q that likely embeds some spending ahead of the NFL season and then obviously harvesting that in the fourth quarter? Tom Reeg : Yes, 3Q is probably a coin flip as to whether or not we are slightly positive or slightly negative as you allude to. There's a lot of -- basically, you have a lot of pre-football season spend, and you only got about three NFL weeks to work against that. I would also tell you, though, that if you had asked me the same question 90-days ago about the quarter that we were in or the quarter that we're in now, we continue to beat our internal expectations. So I'm cautiously optimistic that we could have seen our last negative quarter. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thank you. And then as it pertains to Las Vegas, obviously, second quarter is a tougher comparison with some larger groups that were meaningful in the 2Q last year out. As you think about the second-half of this year, as well as into next year, do you get the sense from kind of your mix shift and your group pace, coupled with kind of what you're seeing on the casino floor that you're able to kind of just shrug off what might be a little bit of a challenging comparison in 2Q and resume growth in the back half of the year? Tom Reeg : Yes. I think that's a great way to put it. I think second quarter is a -- we're going to be very pleased if we match what we did last year. It's -- we remain exceedingly strong. If you look at the next 90-days of our occupancy forecast, which is what we've got the most confidence in at any given point, you're still looking at mid-90s occupancy on the strip at healthy rates. But the -- you're not going to repeat the -- or we feel much better about the utility situation that we had last year in the third quarter and then the fourth quarter, you've got Formula One, which we think will be a significant boost to that quarter. So I'd say something similar to last quarter, second -- or last year's second quarter and then growth in the second-half is a good place to be. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, and then if I may, just one follow-up along those same lines. As you guys look out on the horizon in terms of bookings, and I'm talking more so towards leisure transient, et cetera., are you seeing anything across the market from a promotional perspective that has changed at all? Tom Reeg : Nothing that's material enough to impact us that we'd want to discuss. We see in various markets. It depends who our competitors are, what the market looks like. You've seen some remained disciplined. Others, not. The -- sadly, one of the statements I can make Caesars used to be the bad actor in a lot of these markets and isn't anymore. So we feel very good about the current environment. Carlo Santarelli : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. Just starting with Las Vegas, Tom. Obviously, the 21% of occupied rooms in the first quarter relating to the group segment, that's a fairly significant jump and good to see. Can you talk about how group looks for the balance of this year? Is group pace, group room nights up in the aggregate 2Q through 4Q? Bret Yunker : Joe, all the KPIs in the group and convention business are up for last year in 2019. So both rooms, ADRs and banquet revenues are pacing ahead for the rest of the year. We expect the group business to have another record year in 2023. Joe Greff : Great, thank you. And then on Digital, Tom, you had spoken earlier that your outlook is favorable just over the last 90-days. And I know you talked about some of the things that you're doing there. How much of that is a rationalized cost structure and the scale benefits in OSB? How much of that is related to iCasino and some of the things that you have done and will be doing this year? Tom Reeg : So those are -- you're hitting on the main contributors. The chief driver of the change has been what we've done on the promo and branding side, I think promo as a percent of handle for the quarter was around 1.25%, which is dramatically lower than our peers. Our cost of acquisition has come down considerably. Ohio as a new launch state for us was EBITDA positive in March, so month three post-launch. So we're really feeling good about the way that we're running the business and how we're positioned. Matt and iGaming has done a great job of continuing to build that business off of the current platform, but we really think the opportunity there starts in earnest beginning of third quarter when we launch the new iCasino app. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed. Steven Wieczynski : Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So, Tom, if I can I put you back on your soapbox for a minute? I want to get your opinion on a question we get a lot from investors. They always seem to want to know, they would want to ask and they just want to get the feel for -- is this going to be the best that Vegas ever is, especially as we kind of move through 2023 strong event calendar. So just maybe if you could opine on that as to maybe why that's not the case. Tom Reeg : Yes. I think you've seen Vegas as a market do a fantastic job of continuing to add events. And in the case of sports franchises or Formula One that bring a significantly more valuable customer to the market. So if I look at Vegas now, all of us are pretty full, I listened to Bill and team yesterday, congratulations to them, they had a fantastic quarter as well. But we're all doing well here. Occupancy rates are quite high. And so yes, it's natural to say, how do you get better? Well, you get better by up-tiering the average customer that is coming to the market. And that's what you can see in our own microcosm of the market in Caesars, where what's happened in our business over the last three years is both the expense discipline, but also a better average customer. And you see the raiders come to town. You see Formula One. You see us gaining share as a market in the group business. The people that come to see those, to see Formula One, the A, has just announced a couple of weeks ago, tend to be a better average customer. So you're bringing in higher-value customers and we're already full, so you're kicking out the lowest end. I see no reason that, that needs to stop or would stop. This market has done great job over the 30-years I've been involved in and around gaming. And continuing to add reasons for people to come, continuing to add capacity and continuing to add to the average customer that shows up here. We all know that back in our parents' day, it was a very different market, low value, you get stake in lobster for a couple of bucks. Now you're talking about one of the best food and beverage scenes in the world, among the best sports and entertainment experiences in the world and continually adding to that. We are working to continue to add to that, MGM, Wynn, Sands, they're all working to up-tier what we're offering to customers. And then the market as a whole -- I've got to give credit to Steve Hill at LVCVA, he was the driver of bringing Formula One here, and it's going to be huge for the market. So the nice thing about -- we all like to stand back to back, see who's tallest in this market and argue about that, but we do work together well to make sure that this market continues to expand. And I think it's foolish to bet that, that 30-year cycle is all of a sudden going to be over a quarter from now. Steven Wieczynski : And then, Tom, I know you said -- thanks for that by the way, that was very helpful. And I know you said you aren't giving guidance, but look, unfortunately, our investors are going to take your $5 billion math essentially as guidance for 2025. So I guess what I want to ask here is I assume your $5 billion math, just meaning the consumer stays pretty much where they are right now. But if you think about all those buckets, you laid out to get to that $5 billion. What would be the one bucket that you would say is maybe the most, I don't konw if it's the word most concerned about or the biggest stretch to kind of get there and hopefully, that makes sense. Tom Reeg : Yes, so I'm talking about a three-year time horizon, right. So end of \u201825, we're not typically talking about that type of time horizon on a call like this. So is it possible in that three years, you have a cyclical downturn. Yes, sure. So do you want equivalent and say $5 billion might be $4.75 billion, all right, I'll give you that. That's $1 a share on that free cash flow number. You're talking about a company here that has been levered for a very long time, before we ever got here and then post-merger. And I see a path to where lease-adjusted leverage is less than 4 times, conventional leverage is less than 3 times, and we're spinning out over $12 a share of free cash flow. Quite frankly, if you want to say, gee, I think it will be $10 or $11 instead of $12, I think that still looks good against the stock that's at $44. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on regionals, Tom. Could you talk about maybe the cadence over the course of the quarter and what you've seen into April? I know there's been some noise in terms of comparisons, both on a year-over-year and versus 2019 basis. But it sounds like the consumer is doing fine. So if you can maybe just provide some clarity or any additional color on that? Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'd say March was -- I told you on the last call, I think we could have an all-time record in March. It was an all-time record for us, so regional and Vegas were strong. April, you had a negative calendar shift that we get back in June. So I'd expect that you should see -- or you should expect to see that roll through the numbers. But generally speaking, we are continue -- seeing continued strength across the portfolio. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then Pompano, you mentioned this quickly in your prepared remarks. I mean this was a big JV project with a long-term time horizon that was supposed to be built out over time. You've had the casino expansion now come online. How should we think about maybe some JV equity cash flow distributions coming from this and the returns over time? And maybe even in the near-term, are you seeing any disruption as this bigger term -- bigger project gets built out? Tom Reeg : So the front of our property is definitely disrupted, there's a top golf and the public under construction, and we redid our Portico share. But despite that, we're seeing significant momentum in Pompano generally. If I had to point to our stars as we sit here right now today, Pompano and Reno jumped out at me in the last 30-days or so. What you're going to see out of Pompano in terms of that JV, we've, finally, thankfully work through all of the local approvals required. We're moving dirt to track is closed. Grandstands coming down. So you're going to see a lot of development activity there over the next 12 to 24 months. There is cash in the JV. We would expect to be -- if there is any capital required from the JV partners, it's already in the JV. To your point, we're probably closer to where cash starts to come out of the JV, but I don't think that's a \u201823 event. I think that's \u201824 or \u201825. But we're particularly pleased that has taken far longer than we anticipated when we originally announced it. I don't typically announce something and say, get excited six years from now, but I thought it was going to happen much quicker than that, but we're now right on the cusp of where that's going to drive not only the cash flow into the JV that's going to allow distribution. But as importantly, for us, the traffic to the property that's going to continue the momentum that we've seen over the last quarter or two. Dan Politzer : Got it, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. You may proceed. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So just a couple of more big-picture questions. Tom back to your last discussion. When you guys go through your longer-term scenario planning or stress testing or whatever you call it, wondering if you'd be willing to sort of update or refresh a bear case to that $5 billion longer-term planning. Tom Reeg : Yes. So we're an $11 billion revenue company, plus or minus. If you look back to the crisis, \u201808, you're talking about an 8% hit to that number. So call it, $800 million in a GFC-type scenario. I'd expect about 50% of that flows through. So in that scenario, I think your $400 million of EBITDA that's at risk. I don't personally see a GFC-type scenario coming. I think based on what we can see, if there's a slowdown, it should be relatively shallow. In those numbers, particularly in Las Vegas, you had a massive supply increase into the financial crisis that doesn't occur here. So I'd be thinking more along the lines of half of that $800 and $400 as kind of what I see sitting here today as our balance sheet risk in a normal cyclical downturn. Brandt Montour : That's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then over at the three-legged stool for digital. If you could -- is it any way you could force rank those three legs, sort of from least challenging to maybe what you consider most challenging of the three? And then which of those three legs do you think we could be sitting here in a couple of years and you just sort of knocked the cover off the ball? Tom Reeg : I mean, I'd say they're all challenging. This has been quite an experience over the last 18 months in terms of building this business from zero. Feel really good about where we are today. I would say, I'm cognizant that I've been talking about iCasino for a while, and we have not turned. So I would look at that as that's the one where I understand we've got to show it to you. But given what's required there in terms of what we need to do and the leadership that we now have in place in that vertical, I think that's also where we can surprise you to the upside over that three-year time frame. Brandt Montour : Great, thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. You may proceed. Barry Jonas : Hey, Tom. I really appreciate all the commentary on the three-year potentially where EBITDA and deleverage could get and some of the sensitivities. I'm just curious, where do things like New York, Dubai or sale-leasebacks fit in there? Is that cushion? Or is that even a potential upside? Tom Reeg : Yes. So the numbers I gave you don't include any real estate activity. So if we win New York, if VICI exercises its call on Centaur as it has indicated that it is going to, that's upside from those numbers that I've given you both from a leverage and free cash flow perspective. Barry Jonas : Great. And then just as a follow-up, I think MGM just announced an acquisition of an online game developer. Curious what your thoughts are for more investment on the content side, vertical integration or just digital M&A in general? Tom Reeg : We want to migrate to more of our own games. That's part of what moving to our new app and ultimately our PAM allows us to do. And I would say we are more of a builder versus a buyer, but that could change tomorrow if we see something attractive. Barry Jonas : Perfect, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may proceed. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, just kind of wanted to run a high-level corporate finance question by you to get your take on it. But if we kind of think out a little further as we know you're doing internally as you think about these numbers, if we take this $12.50 of free cash flow, I mean, scratch math is that's about a 28% free cash flow yield. You're paying down 8% debt at the moment, moving probably closer to 7% debt in terms of what's going to be coming available at some point and just where your long-term cost of debt is? So at some point, when you can start to maybe turn the corner to '24, somewhere in here, probably when is that place where it makes sense to start expressing your view as it relates to that 28%? I.e., a different way of saying it, when you flip from paying down debt to buying back stock because one would think that yield is just -- it's just going to be too incredibly attractive to ignore? Tom Reeg : Yes. That's a fair question, Shaun. It's not a simple question. We think that it's important that we continue to delever, because that's a limiting factor in terms of investor acceptance of the story. We're also cognizant that the track record of buying in this sector is kind of rough. If I pay down debt, it's a certain outcome in terms of what I'm doing. I have money that I owe that I no longer owe. As you go into buying your stock, you're subject to the wins of the macro, which has been the story in this space for the last 18 months. But there certainly is a point with leverage where you should expect that in addition to continuing to pay down debt that there's a return of capital element to our free cash flow story. And you're talking about '24, which would be somewhere around the midpoint of the time frame that I laid out in terms of expectations, that's probably a pretty good guess. Shaun Kelley : Very helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just with my follow-up, just a quick update on kind of the union renegotiation, any impacts of that on the cost front. Assume that's obviously all factored into in general, the growth that you're expecting to still achieve in Las Vegas, but just how do you see that playing through appreciating that those types of things are specific negotiations are hard to comment on a public conference call? Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean, first of all, our expectations are built into those broader expectations. As you've seen in the quarter, we're doing quite well. We've been doing quite well for a while, Vegas is now at $2.1 billion market. Northern Nevada for us is over $0.25 billion of EBITDA per year. We built those results on our frontline employees so they deserve to sharing it. We've got a contract that is up at the end of this month. I would expect with everybody in the market, you're going to see a short-term extension in terms of getting to a final deal, but you're going to see a significant raise for our frontline workers and they deserve it. And that's in our -- in the numbers that I laid out in terms of expectations. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. You may proceed. Chad Beynon : Afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Tom, it appears that interest rate hiking acceleration has potentially slowed here, which would potentially spark some more M&A activity broadly in the space. So when you're thinking about these '24, '25 goals, not that you're running anything to be sold, but has anything changed just in terms of the number of assets in the regional markets, in Vegas that makes sense for kind of the future portfolio of Caesars? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd say short answer is no. We've got nothing for sale today. Don't expect to have anything for sale anytime soon. That said, as I've told you before, effectively as a public company, everything is for sale every day, so you don't know what you'll be approached with. But back to Shaun's question, as you get to the point leverage-wise, where we feel comfortable, next year in addition to a return of capital element, you start to think about the ability to become offensive in M&A, which obviously is a little more complex at our size, but we've driven a whole lot of shareholder value through M&A in the past. And I don't think we're very far from where we would see -- where we would flip to maybe looking offensively there versus kind of neutral, maybe something shows up, maybe it doesn't, but that would be in the calculus of what are you doing with your free cash flow as well. Chad Beynon : Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then nobody has asked about potential impact, just overall benefits with DAs potentially moving to Las Vegas. Obviously, it should be a positive. As we've seen with other sports teams and just overall programming, but any additional thoughts in terms of what this would mean to Las Vegas, to your properties, to future growth? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes, it's exciting to see this market continue to develop. The -- we welcome the announcement. Similar to Bill's remarks yesterday. It's important to us that their coming is done in a manner that doesn't unnecessarily tax the county or have taxes that eventually get passed on to our customers. So we think there's wood to chop there, but we are thrilled at the idea of the A's coming to town. It provides another reason for customers to come and visit the market, and we're going to get our share of those customers. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. You may proceed. John DeCree : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one or perhaps a two-parter. Tom or Eric, you talked about executing on iGaming with some key product enhancements on the horizon like that single app for iCasino. And I think you mentioned some additional marketing capabilities that, that would bring. But it might be helpful for investors to kind of understand what some of these product enhancements get you and what you'll be able to do specifically to generate some incremental revenue or start to execute in iGaming. If you could maybe elaborate a little bit more on that, that would be helpful. Eric Hession : Yes, sure. From the highest perspective, when you think about the current app that we have, somebody goes on the app store, searches for Caesars and they see the Caesars Sportsbook. And they get that if they want to play the Casino or the Sportsbook. So they download the Sportsbook. They sign up for the Sportsbook. Then they go find the button that takes them to the casino and then they can start playing the casino. The next time they go and log on again to the app, it takes them to the Sportsbook and then they have to click through to go to the casino. So it's a fine experience for somebody who's predominantly a Sportsbook player who then likes to dabble or play some of the casino side. But for somebody who's a primary casino customer or somebody who likes to play a little bit of Sportsbook but mostly casino, they want to see the Casino app and they want to go right into the homepage where the casino games are that they can start engaging with. So at the highest level, you're going to attract a customer that, quite frankly, is very more akin to what our casinos are, which is somebody who likes to come in, play slots, likes to see their favorite game and then start playing. And so we're going to be able to deliver that. In terms of the incremental functionality that we're going to get, we'll have a newly designed lobby so that it will be much easier for our team to move the games around, to prioritize them, to make them -- to advertise them based on whether they're new or there's a promotion going on, we'll be able to have some much enhanced real-time marketing capabilities. So we'll be able to do some trigger-based responses to customers, which is something that we're not able to do right now. And then the general appearance and the speed of the app will be greatly enhanced. So overall, it's going to provide a much better experience for that customer that currently, we're unable to provide the product that they want because it's somewhat buried in the Sportsbook. John DeCree : That's helpful, Eric. Maybe a follow-up question in terms of what you see. One of your big advantages is your customer database and without that single app, and you look at your penetration of that database for digital. Relative to your peers or expectations, is there a chunk of the database that you haven't really been able to get on board without that single app? Just kind of see if you have some visibility into what the opportunity is? Eric Hession : Yes. I would say, in general, the customers that we have tend to skew younger and tend to skew more male on the Sportsbook app. And then what that translates to on the casino side is a higher percentage of table games business, which is great. We like that. But what we're missing is that core slot customer. And so when you think about the business that we have here with the regional players and the hub-and-spoke model with respect to Vegas, that core slot player is really valuable on the casino side. And so we think that by giving that customer an option to go directly into the app, we'll be able to provide them with something that's more in line with what they're expecting from their experience. And so to answer your question directly, I think it's going to attract a higher percentage of the slot customer, which is our core customer from the land-based perspective. John DeCree : That makes sense, Eric. I appreciate that additional color. Thank you. Eric Hession : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. You may proceed. David Katz : Hi, afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. With respect to the Las Vegas Strip, the tower project announcement sort of begs a discussion about where the strip is headed because I think many would agree with the positive outlook that you've laid out. And with that, other competitors entering the market, right, whether it's Hard Rock or Fat and Blue and over time, sort of upping your game. And I had an accounting press used to say $100 million here and there, and it starts turning into real money. Is this the kind of thing we should expect as you sort of up your strip game over time? Tom Reeg : I mean, this is a pretty unique project. We've got a tower that can be absorbed into a property that has higher room rate -- considerably higher room rate, considerably higher spend out of those rooms. And it has rooms that are existing that face the fountains across the street at Bellagio that have no windows. So what we can do here is a simple upgrade in terms of the rate that those rooms will get and then create on that side facing the strip, probably some of our most attractive non-villa product in the market. And it's very easy to run the numbers and see the returns there are quite strong. I'll tell you, there has yet to be a capital project with the returns of this one that took more than 30 seconds for us to approve. You're going to see us upgrade Flamingo in terms of its food and beverage, particularly its strip frontage. Food and beverage, but you're not talking about even the quantum of spend that you're talking about at Paris and Bally's. So I think there's a few one-off opportunities that are high ROI, but the great thing about our portfolio on the strip is it's all right at mid-field, right, at the 50-yard line. And the demand for that location is exceedingly strong and has been better than a generation. So we feel very good, and there's not a ton of capital necessary to maintain that beyond what we've done historically, but there are some interesting projects that can be additive. David Katz : Understood. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Stephen Grambling : Hi, thanks. Just following up on John's earlier questions on iGaming and the digital business. Just wanted to clarify, as you move to a standalone iGaming app, is that going to be branded as Caesars iGaming? Or could you have multiple brands under each of your casino names? And is there any way to assess what the potential for incremental omnichannel spend could be as we think through total rewards sign-ups that have occurred through the app, for example, to-date? Tom Reeg : So on the brand, Stephen, let me tell you to wait for about 60-days and to have a further answer on that. But I like the way that you think. And then on Caesars Rewards, we've talked about play that was generated new to the enterprise through digital, into brick-and-mortar or reactivated customers. The last time we told you that number, it was about $200 million on an annual basis. Without getting into a specific number, I'd tell you, it's more than 50% larger than that today. Stephen Grambling : And just as a very quick follow-up on that, but that's not something that you're embedding in your hypothetical $5 billion 2025? Tom Reeg : No. I mean there is a contributing factor in what happens in the brick-and-mortar, the digital part of both, directly and indirectly, but there's nothing needs to happen that isn't already happening or on the horizon in terms of the projects. Stephen Grambling : Fair enough. Thanks so much. Tom Reeg : All right. Thank you, Stephen. With that, I'm going to let everybody go. Thanks for your time and attention. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Anthony Carano. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon to everyone on the call. We delivered another strong quarter with consolidated EBITDA exceeding $1 billion. Operating trends within our property portfolio have remained strong, despite a tough year-over-year comparison, driven by a single large convention event, our Las Vegas segment delivered second best Q2, adjusted EBITDA of $512 million. Our Regional portfolio delivered $508 million in adjusted EBITDA down slightly last year. And finally, our Digital segment reported $11 million of adjusted EBITDA, the segments first quarter of profitability since we rebranded to Caesars Sportsbook in Q3 of \u201821. Underlying demand trends in Las Vegas remained strong during Q2, with occupancy growth of 100 basis points to 97.6%. Total Las Vegas segment revenues were down 1% as a result of exceptional performance last year in our Group segment. Excluding real rent payments, plus Vegas generated $523 million of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 46.3%. Las Vegas continues to benefit from strong leisure and casino guests demand, the return of international guests and exciting events calendar and the continued strength of the group and convention segment in \u201823. While a group and convention segment EBITDA in Las Vegas was down year-over-year in the second quarter, pays for the remainder of \u201823 points to another record EBITDA year for the segment. In our Regional segment, revenues were up slightly and adjusted EBITDA declined 1% to $508 million. We were excited to open two new temporary facilities this quarter in Danville, Virginia and Columbus, Nebraska. Both properties open to strong customer demand. While we face new competition in a few markets during the quarter, customer demand trends remain stable and similar to prior quarters. Our capital projects continue to deliver solid returns. Lake Charles and [inaudible] note delivered strong quarters and early returns in Danville and Columbus are exceeding plan. We're excited to finish work on the Harrah's Hoosier Park expansion this fall and continue to make progress on the permanent facilities in Danville and Columbus. Work in New Orleans is progressing nicely and we continue to target a late \u201824 opening. Construction has started on the Versailles Tower rebrand in Las Vegas, which is expected to be completed by spring of 2024. And finally, we recently opened a new show in Atlantic City called THE HOOK which was accompanied by the opening of Superfrico Atlantic City as well. We have solid momentum heading into the second half of the year, as we continue to deliver strong returns on project CapEx, drive profitability in our digital segment and remain focused on operational excellence in our property portfolio. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in the first half of \u201823. Our success is a direct result of their dedication, our team members have and their commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences every day. With that I will now turn the call over to Eric Hession for some insights on the second quarter in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks Anthony. During the second quarter of 2023, we delivered another significant improvement in the performance of our digital segment versus last year. Our business reported $11 million of adjusted EBITDA and $216 million of net revenue versus a $69 million EBITDA loss last year. Results this quarter represent our first full quarter of EBITDA profitability since rebranding to Caesars Sportsbook in Q3 2021. During the quarter, sports betting hold improved 180 basis points versus last year, and iCasino volume increased 27% year-over-year. Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of our targeted promotional investment and overall lower level of marketing within our existing customer base as well as customers located in the new states. We have recently introduced four significant pieces of new and exciting technology improvements that we expect will be well received by our customers. First, our new iCasino product Caesars Palace online is now live in multiple states and pending regulatory approval in the others. The new iCasino product offers a significantly improved product and enhanced marketing capabilities, all combined with the compelling benefits of Caesars rewards. Secondly, we recently transitioned our Caesars app in Nevada to our flagship Liberty product, which delivers a significantly improved product for our customers. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate converting our William Hill product and our retail sportsbooks to delivery platform at some point later this year. Third, we've started out rolling our net native iOS Sportsbook app and anticipate reaching 100% adoption in August. The new native app is receiving consistently higher performance feedback and will result in faster loading speeds, improve stability, and enhance development speed. And fourth, we're on track to introduce our in house player account management system starting state by state later this year, which will ultimately lead to a shared wallet that we anticipate rolling out in 2024. These four products have consumed significant amounts of technical resources over the past year, and we're very excited to introduce them to our customers. We now offer sports betting in 30 North American jurisdictions, 22 of which offer mobile wagering. We also operate iCasino products in six jurisdictions. I'll now pass the call to Bret for additional comments. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. As you'll see in our earnings release, and subsequent to the quarter end, we successfully acquired the remaining minority equity interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, which allowed us to fully repay its $250 million Term Loan B, yielding significant interest expense savings given its high cost of debt. Pro Forma for its repayment and the most recent rate hike from the Fed, our average cost of debt sits just inside of 7% with annual net cash interest expense of approximately $800 million, which is well positioned to decline going forward given continued debt reduction alongside built-in spread adjustments tied to declining leverage in our loan agreements. CapEx spend is also expected to decrease in 2023 at just over $800 million, with several growth projects being completed either later this year or in 2024. Coupling declining interest expense in CapEx with continued EBITDA growth sets up for accelerating free cash flow dynamics going forward. Over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Very happy with the quarter, strong quarter again for us. Starting in Las Vegas, keep in mind we were up against the strongest quarter that we've ever had in Las Vegas, we were missing a large group that comes once every three years to Caesars properties that was in last year's numbers. Not in this year's numbers. We telegraphed that last quarter. So that was known what you saw last week in the Nevada numbers was June hold in [inaudible] was not as strong as it was in the prior year. We participated in that and I don't particularly like to talk about hold, but it's notable enough that I should in this quarter. We're in the gambling business, what we're looking for is the volumes to come through the property. And they came through we just didn't hold in June, like we did in the past June both the miss in that -- of the group from last year and the hold impact in June, are diluted to margins. Obviously, the group business for us is accretive to our overall Vegas margin. And then clearly revenue that would flow with normal hold is accretive as well. So as you're looking at margins on a year-over-year basis, keep that in consideration as we look at forward in Vegas continues to look very strong. We had a strong July; we feel very good about the remainder of third quarter. And then fourth quarter, you've got Formula One first quarter of \u201924, you've got Super Bowl. I've said in the past, I think Formula One is a 5% list. Not including whatever happens at the tables really just from increased hotel revenue that still -- hotel and food beverage revenue that still seems to be the right zip code for us. Demand for F1 particularly at the high end has been very, very strong for us. We feel very good of it as to how we are positioned ahead of the event and we're anxious like everybody else to see how this event plays in Las Vegas as we look to future years. Superbowl \u201824 is exceedingly strong from a demand standpoint, where we sit today in terms of booked capacity versus a typical Super Bowl. We are dramatically ahead of and at higher rates than ever it typically at this time ahead of the Super Bowl. And if you just anecdotally look at who's going to be getting our tickets, the average customer that will come to the game with us is substantially more valuable than prior Super Bowl. So Vegas remains very, very strong for us. Feels very good, really no discernible impact in terms of any recessionary concerns, any concerns about the consumer. As we look out, the only thing to call out Anthony talked about the Jubilee Tower at Valley being converted to Versailles at Paris, we'd expect those rooms to be back online, before the end of the year, we don't expect the entire project to be done until first half of next year. But there will be some disruption in that tower at Horseshoe now that we're underway. If you look at the regional portfolio, and really the whole quarter is a testament to diversification we had what I what I'm talking about in terms of the group mess -- the missing group in Vegas and the hold impact in June. In the regional business, we've got a number of properties that are under competitive pressure, due to competitive openings. I'd call out Tunica is facing a property that open about an hour closer to Memphis that is pressured Tunica. We've got Council Bluffs has been a bit pressured by casino capacity we added in Nebraska. And then we have Chicago properties, both in Illinois and Indiana, that are impacted by the expanded casino offerings in Illinois that have come online and continue to come online. On the other side of that what we've got is the fruits of our capital investment cycle that whereas Bret said, we're reaching, we're crossing and reaching the end of. You've got new property in Danville; you've got projects in both Indianapolis tracks. You got Lake Charles now open; you've got the Atlantic City spend. And as a result, our regional EBITDA despite a super strong comp, were just about flat year-over-year, which I think is going to compare well with others that you'll see over the next couple of weeks. Again, as you look to third quarter off to a strong start, we're comping against an extremely strong third quarter of last year in regional and looks like we'll be able to beat that this year through July. That's particularly encouraging for us. Now flipping to digital, digital was a loss last year. And we've talked a lot about inflecting the positive and driving real EBITDA through that vertical and it's spectacular to see our first full quarter of positive EBITDA as Eric detailed. I laid up pretty specific targets in terms of where we can be in digital looking out to \u201825 on our last call, and that I went to some conferences where a lot of you told me there's no way we'll get there. I would tell you, every number that I laid out, 90 days ago or so, I'm 100% confident that we're going to hit them. Every metric that I look at going forward is at or above where we were 90 days ago when I laid out those targets. So I tell you, I'm reiterating those targets as we look forward. Big, on the tech side, those are big moves for us. It's very -- you've put them in a list and I don't really know that the impact is emphasized enough. When we took over William Hill, William Hill had one employee working on iGaming. We were on old technology that was limited in a whole number of wins. We soft launch, Caesars Palace casino about two weeks ago, we're waiting on approval in a couple of jurisdictions that I expect any day now, and then you'll see a full launch of the product. But I'd encourage you to go take a look, it's a casino first entry into our digital business. And in terms of capabilities bonusing, segmentation, proprietary games live dealer it is lightyears beyond what we've been operating under that, as Eric said, grew iGaming revenue to 27% in the quarter. We are fully aware that we have seen significant competition in the iCasino space, we don't expect that we're just going to come in and run everybody over. But we feel like we've got the product to start to build market share, and wrapping that into Caesars rewards has been and will continue to be powerful for that business. So you'll look at the quarter, second quarter of last year, was the best second quarter that we ever had, the second best quarter that we had ever had, and we topped it in EBITDA this year. So return in digital, and regional holding its own to offset the loss of that group in Vegas. So this is exactly how we built this business. And it's great to see it come together. And one more point on digital. Moving to Liberty in Nevada is an enormous lift. We were operating on the equivalent of a Commodore 64 computer in the old technology. And now we have the state of the art Liberty app that we operate in all of our jurisdictions. This is a dramatic leap for us in Nevada, if you think about the Super Bowl happening, and all of the visitors that will come to the state and our market position in the state. And now we have the app too, that's competitive with what they've got at home, whether it's with us or somebody else, that's going to be a giant customer acquisition opportunity for us. So we're particularly excited about that, I would expect that 95% of our handle in Nevada will be on Liberty by the middle of this month. And virtually all of it by kickoff of football season. So we feel really, really this is our third NFL kickoff, since we launched our digital business, in terms of how I feel heading into the season, I think we are very, very well positioned as we head in. So Bret talked about, we continue to pay down debt. Conventional leverage now is around four times and going lower, would expect that to go lower. Given where we are in the capital cycle, where we are with the performance of the business, we're starting to look at what do you do with the free cash flow that will be generated in \u201924 and \u201825? And is there a return of capital piece? Or is there an external opportunity that could be interesting to us, I tell you, as you're sitting here today, three years after the Caesars transaction close, it was 30-60 days beyond the first time where I'm feeling where we can be offensive from an external opportunity standpoint. So it has been a long road to get through. Everything that happened with COVID, the merger, we really, really feel like we're on strong footing as we head forward. And the cash flow machine here is going to continue to accelerate as results continue to improve, digital continues to deliver improving cash flow, interest expense goes down. We really feel strongly about where we sit today. And with that, I'll open it up for questions from the audience. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Tom, given what you said today tonight, about Las Vegas trends, how aggressive of a scenario is it for you to experience year-over-year net revenue growth in the 3Q? I would imagine the answer for that, with respect to the 4Q is not aggressive, given that one booking, and then I have a follow up on digital. Tom Reeg : Yes, Joe, we feel good about third quarter. I'm looking forward occupancy over the next three months in the range of let's call it 96% to 98%, depending on the property. So feel very, very good about third quarter. One thing to keep in mind in Vegas is that I didn't touch on in my remarks is Rio. We anticipated it will leave the portfolio October 1 as you're looking to kind of second and third quarter results at the Rio that's a revenue producer, but a drag on EBITDA, it doesn't produce enough EBITDA to offset its lease payment in the second third quarter. So as that comes off, in the fourth quarter, that'll be accretive to EBITDA end margin. Joe Greff : Great. On digital, maybe this is a question for Eric, but whoever wants to answer it. How do you think about the conversion of OSD and gross gaming revenue, instant net revenue into next year? And then specifically on iGaming gross revenue? We noticed that include increased sequentially $80 million in 2Q versus $75 million in 1Q. How do you think about the segment's growth going forward? Is iGaming presently EBITDA positive? And did the count for all in more than 100% of the 2Q EBITDA results? Thanks. Eric Hession : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll grab this one, Joe. So from a reinvestment perspective, and you can see this in the Q that was published simultaneously with the call today, our reinvestment levels as a percentage of volume were around 1%. And our reinvestment, as a percentage of gaming revenues was around 22% in total, that's on the lower end, I think from a percentage of volume is where you'll see it going forward. The reinvestment for existing customers tends to be below that. And then depending on how many new customers we sign up, that'll bring that number up slightly, just generally, because second quarter has fewer signups given no football and no startup sports. So that range on a percentage of volume, I think it will range between that 1% and 1.25% kind of going forward. So, from a reinvestment perspective, that's kind of how I would think about it. From a volume perspective, from the iCasino side, and just from a general business side, as Tom mentioned, that's an area where we really feel quite optimistic about, we're finally going to have a competitive product out in the market that we can use to work with our existing database, to have those customers that we know and that are loyal to the Caesars rewards program move over to the online casino side, it was difficult to have that discussion with the customers when they had to go through the sports betting app each time to get to the casino. And so they won't have that. In addition, some of the things Tom also touched on, we haven't been able to really do segmented marketing in any degree so far with the existing tech that we had. The new system that we have will allow us to create segmentation and it'll allow us to reinvest, like we do on the casino side and to use a lot of those experiences. So from that standpoint, when you look forward, we're very excited about the iCasino products and the ability to slowly grow some share, and ultimately drive the profitability of the business towards those targets that Tom laid out. Operator : Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys, good afternoon. Tom, Obviously, kind of a little bit of a change in some of your thoughts around the ability to kind of be aggressive as you put it with external opportunities. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how you foresee needs for things that you think, you guys could obviously do to enhance growth going forward et cetera and kind of the driver behind maybe that comment? Tom Reeg : Yes, so we're, key is we're getting toward the end of a capital circle, right, as New Orleans runs off. We don't have the, any of the chunky projects that we've had going, really, since the merger on our plane, there's some meaningful projects in particular markets, but you're not looking at the $300 million, $400 million or $500 million capital outlays. So from a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, you get to a point where you're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow and look at what do I do with it. We, as a team have delivered a lot of value over the last decade, to stakeholders through external opportunities. So, of course, we're going to look for, that for potential future opportunities now that we're in a position to tackle those but don't read that as a lack of confidence in the growth potential of the existing portfolio. As I said, last quarter, we're on a run rate of about a little over $4 billion of trailing EBITDA, we think there's $0.5 billion plus available to us in the digital business. And something similar to that in the brick and mortar business as we get returns, from the projects that have recently come online and are still to come online. And that should push us toward a $5 billion company. But as you look at where do what do I do with cash flow when paying down leverage might be generating, diminishing returns in terms of shareholder value, then you start to think of am I distributing that cash flow in some form or fashion, or am I putting it to work elsewhere? And we've got a great track record of putting it to work elsewhere. So we'll explore that as we move forward. Carlo Santarelli : Great, thanks. And if I could just one follow up as you guys think about the various moving parts in Las Vegas, through the back half of the year, you obviously have the Rio which you notice coming out that adds somewhere in the ballpark of 100 basis points to margins, you have the labor negotiations that are ongoing, presumably. And obviously then you have Formula One, do you see the back half of the year as kind of being the flattish to up margins kind of net over the last six months of reasonable expectation? Tom Reeg : See, I think that's a reasonable expectation Carlo. And touching on the labor agreements, labor agreements expired by contract at the end of May. We're operating under -- everybody on the surface operating under extensions. As we speak, there is work being done in terms of a new contract, I think it's, you're talking about complex stuff that takes a little while. But I'd expect that we'll have new agreements by the fall. And I'm not expecting a whole lot of drama around. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : Hey, good. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on digital first. Because the whole I think you call that was 6.4% it was up 108 bps year-over-year. How do you think about sports betting hold and growing it over time? And what do you kind of see is kind of the guideposts as you kind of maybe get to that 2025 level where you would see that high EBITDA flow through? Eric Hession : Yes, it's a great question. I think we've made a lot of improvements over the last kind of year, year and a half with respect to just the trading team getting more experienced, but also on the tech side. So I think as we go forward, you will continue to see a higher percentage of customers not betting straight wagers. So whether that's an in play or player prop or same game parlay type wagers that generally have a higher hold percentage that's going to contribute to the increase. I suspect at this point, we're probably going to get to somewhere, say 7.5% to 8%. Which I think is reasonable expectation given where we see the mix of our business. We do have a lower hold percentage here in Las Vegas, and in Nevada, due to the size of the straight wagers that we take in the state. That will drag it down a bit. But overall, I think getting to that 7.5% to 8% is a reasonable expectation. Dan Politzer : Got it and then just pivoting Horseshoe, Baltimore, I know you acquired the remaining stake in that. I think VICI has a row for option on that as well as one for Caesars Virginia. So can, as you think about that deleveraging path and things are obviously moving in the right direction? Can you maybe talk about other ancillary options as it relates to the original portfolio and the possibility that there's maybe an avenue with VICI, where you can get a bunch of cash in the door. Tom Reeg : Look, Dan, I'm not short on cash. So that's really not something I'm targeting. There are roofers on both Baltimore and Virginia. I wouldn't anticipate either being exercised. Operator : Our next question come from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : Hey, guys, good afternoon. So okay, Tom, following up on Carlos\u2019 question. We now have gotten a bunch of questions from investors about your commentary that you would take this excess free cash flow and, in your words, and put it to use elsewhere and have a great track record of doing that. So, not sure what else you might say there, but can you elaborate a little bit more on maybe just what that means, and maybe also give us some examples of that. Tom Reeg : Short answer is no. I won't give you exact, maybe I'll, maybe I'll buy Stifel, Steve, -- Steven Wieczynski : Good. Tom Reeg : You know who's out there. What's possible, you know that there are at our size, it's not as easy to find targets that, a, move the needle and b, are actionable from an antitrust perspective. But there's not zero targets available out there. And as we get to the free cash flow levels that we get to given what we have generated in the past in terms of returns, it shouldn't be surprising to anybody that we're going to look for opportunity to do that again. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, I didn't think you'd give me much of an answer, but I hope you do buy us, then I can come deal crap for you, in your casino. So second question, Tom, you talked about June in Vegas, you had the negative hold you witnessed across backgrounds play and look, I know high end is super, super important to you guys. But can you just give us any color around what you're seeing? Business, especially on the international front, and maybe how those folks have or will be coming back into the market? Tom Reeg : Yes, but it has been very strong from a volume standpoint, our volumes at the high end, both domestic and international continued to build. We've put in quite a bit of effort. Caesars had a very strong international business when we arrived, unfortunately, those players weren't traveling, it's great to see that come back. In the interim, we've continued to build on the domestic business. So to give you anecdotal and anecdotal ideas, Steve, I get a hit sheet every day. And in 2021, if I looked at it on a Saturday or Sunday morning, there was -- there might be one player there, that was a significant swing in our results. Now, on a typical Saturday, Sunday, I've got 5 to 10 players that are at a minimum, several $100,000 line of credit. So you've got a much more balanced book, you've got a lot more volume. So it's really continued to build. Obviously, events in the second half or in the fourth quarter with F1. And the first quarter was Super Bowl are fantastic, high end events. And as I said, in my remarks, demand for both of them at the high end is extremely encouraging several months out. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks, two follow ups. First, on the digital side. I think I heard you say this unplanned investment into the Caesars Palace app, does that mean that we should be anticipating to step up in marketing and increase promo spend on iGaming in the near term? Tom Reeg : You should expect us to be visible in terms of promoting the app but nothing anywhere close to what you saw when we launched the sports app. So I would describe this right now in iCasino as and for the last couple of years is invisible from a marketing standpoint will become visible in the next month or so. But that's in the all of the guideposts and markers that I've given, you should be expecting third quarter for the digital business, as I said before, is a coin flip as to which side of breakeven we're on but we should be close. Your fourth quarter should be a significantly positive quarter. And then we should be positive from then on. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And my follow up just taking one more crack at it on the going on offense comments. Is that comment more directed at domestic or international? And do you generally view that more on the digital or physical casino side? Thanks. Tom Reeg : So we are not, we obviously we have little -- we have Canada as a property we manage internationally. We're entirely domestic this point but we are economic animal. So, if there's something that would make sense outside the US, we're willing to get on a plane, but I would expect it would be domestic. And I'm not thinking about a big digital acquisition. Operator : Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So, Tom, just maybe some thoughts on the broader sort of US leisure trends, you sounded obviously confident you're not seeing any type of recessionary activity or anything, there's just a lot of sorts of cross wins and lumpiness across the broader lodging landscape at the low end. And there's been a lot of talk from other hotel operators, calling it normalization. Just curious if you think you're seeing any normalization in Las Vegas. And if it's, if there's any difference at the low end of your database, or of your properties versus sort of the middle, maybe the middle tier. Tom Reeg : Yes, Brandt, we're not really seeing anything, I can speak to that material in terms of softness, at any level of property, the only property that as you're looking at the next quarter, I'd expect to be soft, is the Rio. And that because we're transitioning out of the property, and a lot of the rate of business has already come out of there. But that's obviously unique to that particular property. It feels really strong out here, we're out here. Today, volumes are, as they have been for a year and a half now continue to be very strong. As I told you, I'm looking at forward occupancies depending on properties 96% to 98%. So it's really hard to tell you anything that would give you a bearish stance on Vegas. Brandt Montour : Great, that's super helpful, and then maybe just on Atlantic City. Curious if you want to comment on how that performed, sort of through peak summer here. I think you're sort of disruption free this summer, sort of versus your underwriting or expectations heading into the season. Tom Reeg : Yes, we're kind of -- we are disruption free really since right before 4th of July, we are finishing up the entrance to Caesars Palace. I was out there for the opening of THE HOOK and Superfrico. And it really pleased with the way the renovation work is turned out all that's left is the Nobu Hotel Tower at Caesars, which should be done by the end of the year. Yes, I would say in terms of expectations, Atlantic City, not as strong as I would have hoped it would be but it's fine. And yes, obviously it's within that regional business that was flat in 2Q and I'd expect to grow a little bit in 3Q. Operator : Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe first for just, Eric. Just wanted to ask about on the digital side, maybe at a very high level, could you help us think about as you start as your expense base is increasingly normalized and you continue to get your product roadmap where you want it to be? How do you kind of think about flow throughs in the digital business of sort of percent changes in revenue to EBITDA? What sort of either kind of a directional amount that makes sense, or could you help us think about some of the key levers or line items that you could drive improvement from just as we get out into kind of \u201923-\u201824 and beyond? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. I think if you go back to the prior discussions and calls, we've had about the reductions in some of the expenses that we're currently incurring, that we don't think we'll be burdened with going forward from either the marketing, the team deals, some of the other fixed expenses like that, you can see those rolling off over time. In terms of the balance of the expenses, I think those are going to, might increase a bit like labor and some of the others. But broadly speaking, the true variable expenses that we have, are really taxes, the reinvestment levels, and then super variable, things like credit card processing fees, and so forth, and then aggregate, those should be around 50%. So that once you break the breakeven level, like we have this past quarter, and going forward, you should see quite strong flow through on every incremental dollar that we get. And then for the next couple years anyway, it'll be reduced by the fall off of the fixed marketing expenses that we currently have in the cost structure. Shaun Kelley : So 50% on variable and possibly greater than that when we factor in some of those fixed expenses, if I'm kind of summarizing that right. Does that make sense? Eric Hession : Yes, I think that's a good way to look at it, if you look at this quarter is over 100%. So, but that's because we're cutting more dramatically than I would anticipate going forward on that fixed side. Shaun Kelley : Great. I mean, it makes a ton of sense. Thank you for that. And then one sort of bigger picture, one for Tom. But Tom, you kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about your longer term goals from 90 days ago, and standing by those and I just sort of wanted to kind of specifically, was there like something specific you had in mind? And maybe I'm just not in on either the comment or the joke, but just was there a specific area that was that really directed at free cash flow? Was that directed at the 50% return on digital investments, sort of all the above? Was there just something you were specifically trying to kind of get across relative to where we sat 90 days ago? Tom Reeg : No, it's all of the above, three years ago, we told you, we think we could generate better than 50% annual EBITDA return on the cumulative losses we generate in building the business, we got to about $1.1 billion of cumulative loss before we inflected to positive, which suggests $500 million, a little over $500 million of annual EBITDA at maturity, which I defined, as sometime in 2025. And when I laid those markers out last quarter, I got some skepticism back, and I would tell you, 90 days later, I'm even firmer in my conviction that we meet or exceed those numbers in that timeframe. Operator : Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Barry Jonas : Okay, good afternoon, MGM just announced a comprehensive deal with Marriott. I know you guys had a partnership with Wyndham. But curious how you think about your overall positioning here? Tom Reeg : I feel fine. And I know those types of partnerships are useful from a loyalty branding perspective for the databases at the scale of the company that we've got, where there's nothing out there that we're missing that I expect would materially move the needle for us. Barry Jonas : Great, and then Q3 last year, we were talking a lot about rising energy costs, curious to get the impact this quarter. And I'm also wondering how the heat may be affected player visitation, if at all. Tom Reeg : Yes, so you're remembering correctly, August, September, last year, in particular, we had some unhedged utility costs, primarily in Nevada that bid us were in a much, much better position over the next 60 days, the same 60 days is last year. So I'd expect those costs to be lower. In terms of weather, there's, I can certainly probably come up with weather that impacted us in various places during the quarter. Obviously, it's very hot everywhere recently, but there's nothing to point to as a reason for particular weakness or strength in our markets based on the weather recently. Operator : Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, evening, everyone. I'd like to just go back to the digital, if I may, and just looking at the Q and reflecting back on some of the discussions we had about some of the media partnerships, et cetera. There are still some meaningful commitments, capital wise in terms of those costs, if you could shed a little light on how much of that starting to roll off, is important for hitting these targets these profitability targets, versus how much of it is just execution on getting the new apps rolled out and doing the business? Tom Reeg : Yes, so we've talked in the past about going from zero to 500, it's kind of a three legged stool with each leg similar in terms of impact. One is continued execution, in the OSB arena that we've discussed in terms of continuing to grow, continuing to drive EBITDA there. The second piece is our iCasino share moving toward our OSB market share. And then the third piece is the roll off of partnership and talent contracts over the next three years. David Katz : And those are relatively equal in size. Tom Reeg : Yes, I would say of the three, just basic blocking and tackling is the largest, but it's not dramatically large. Yes, they are two. David Katz : Got it. Okay. And if I may, as my follow up, just focusing on the regional business and trying to think through what it's becoming where we look at CapEx and we're always a little sensitive to CapEx that may give the appearance of being defensive as competition ramps up pretty much across the regions. I suppose what I'm asking is this, what it is, where it's not going to be a lot of growth. There'll be some capital redoes that are necessary at some point. But for the most part, right, or what we're looking at today, kind of is what it is, to repeat myself a little bit. Tom Reeg : Look, that's really a macroeconomic question. Obviously, if you had asked that question, five years ago, none of us saw what was coming from a virus standpoint, and the structural improvements in the business in response to that. So it's hard for me to say, yes, this just is what it is, as far as I can see, we always, so we do 52 quarterly reviews each quarter, or we're going through P&L of each individual business, with the leaders. And we are in properties that we have improved 2x and 3x in EBITDA, we still see opportunity to continue to grow as we move forward. So we don't view this as there's not growth available to us in the regional portfolio. And that, obviously, we've got projects, then that comes online. And I careful in lumping defense, there's varying levels of defense, right? If I'm in a market where my property is just hasn't been touched in a long time. And that's impacting my performance levels, I can certainly see a case where you put in some money to change that. And you may characterize as defensive I think that's growth from where they're, where you're starting from. Now, if you take a case of a property that let's use our Tunica property as an example, if a property opens, and an hour closer to the feeder market, there's very little I can do from an investment standpoint, that's going to change that outcome. These are convenience based properties to begin with. That was the realization that led us to changing subsidies all the way back in the MTR days. But I don't view it as a mistake if and I'm not referring to us. I see others that are investing in properties that have been around a long time but they're behind now based on what's brought market, you can choose to continue to erode and see what you can do cost wise or you can say, I'm going to put some money in this and change my fortunes and I can see people making different decisions say faced with similar circumstances. David Katz : Okay, thank you for the fond memories of MTR, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Afternoon, thanks for taking my question. You've gotten a lot of digital, but I wanted to pile on that. So we get a lot of questions around live dealer, given how big the demand is in Europe and the market cap of the leading player over there. So Eric, maybe for you as it relates to your optimism around iGaming in general, is this expected to be a major piece of the business going forward? And given I guess, the branding, the marketing some of the IP that you have, would you consider doing this in house or use third party exclusive vendors to have the Caesars experience? Thanks. Eric Hession : Yes, sure. I'd say it's definitely going to be a major part of the business going forward. If you look at our current sports book app, which is sorry, the casino app, which is part of the sports book, we have a disproportionately high percentage of table games action versus slot party action. And that's a high percentage of the live dealer, just because of that larger denominator on the table games side, going forward, the standalone Caesars Palace app is going to have a higher percentage of slot business than table, but it's still going to have live dealer and of the overall table games, we do expect that live dealer product to be a sizable percentage. So going forward, it's absolutely a key component of the business. I would say previously, we haven't had as much exposure to that we haven't had branded games. We haven't had dedicated games; we haven't had a lot of the product that's out there. Just we haven't incorporated it into the app, which we will on the new Caesars Palace app. In terms of the question about doing it in house or through a third party, we're definitely going to want to have some branded customized games. But I don't see us bringing it in house at this point anywhere in the near future. Chad Beynon : Okay, thanks. Appreciate it. And then just in terms of legislation that we should be keeping an eye on, I believe North Carolina is out there potentially talking about some expansion of land based gaming, and then on the iGaming front that'll probably roll into Q1 of \u201924. anything else that we should be watching or you're keeping an eye on in the legislative session? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Not in particular, I mean, from a jurisdictional standpoint, the most relevant to us in the near term is New York land base license issuance. And that's where deep into that and hopefully. Operator : Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. John DeCree : Hi, everyone, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one for Bret, on the balance sheet. You mentioned in prepared remark, what was the decision to pull the trigger on Horseshoe bolt more obviously, the cost of debt made sense. But the timing was it contractual, whether to negotiate it with the parameters of that buy out of your partner, something that you guys just kind of did on your own and if you could share what you paid for the minority interest. Bret Yunker : Yes, on the minority interest always we are opportunistic around holding an asset at the right valuation. So we took that in for a little under $70 million. You'll see that in the Q. And once we collapsed and owned 100% of it, you look at that cost of debt. The term loan was pre-payable at par and was midnight on the interest rate with our nearest maturity so it might land that's called a no brainer in terms of what to repay next with our free cash flow. John DeCree : Like perfect, thanks for the detail and then maybe one for Tom or Eric, you've covered a lot of ground on digital, but looks like a pretty successful World Series of Poker for you. Obviously, a great brand online poker isn't a big industry right now. But it's kind of one of your strong suits as you think about your iGaming business going forward. Are there some opportunities on the poker side and with World Series of Poker brands that you could see going forward. Eric Hession : Yes, you're absolutely right. It was an all-time record World Series of Poker both from a prize money perspective, participants perspective, but also from the ability to really provide contribution to the properties that hosted it. We moved it to the Horseshoe last year. So it's kind of the first year those branded as a Horseshoe, and it really drives a lot of activity to the property, a lot of food and beverage, a lot of hotel revenues. So it's really great for us from a portfolio perspective, in addition to the direct revenues that are drives to the, from the actual tournament itself. From an online perspective, we really don't see much movement in terms of new states legalizing, so it's kind of a business that is kind of flat at this point. It vacillates between going up and down based on how customers go. But from a brand perspective, we think it's definitely accretive to the company, and does provide these incentives for customers to come to the brick and mortar locations for the tournaments. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom Reef for any closing remarks. Tom Reeg : Thanks, everybody for your time, attention and support. And we will talk to you in November if we don't see at conference sooner. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With the disclaimer out of the way, I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We delivered the strongest consolidated adjusted EBITDA quarter in the history of the company, led by a new all-time quarterly adjusted EBITDA record in our regional markets, profitability in our digital segment and continued strength in our Las Vegas segment. All three segments grew adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. Starting with our Las Vegas segment. Demand trends remained healthy during the third quarter with occupancy increasing to 96.6% versus 93.6% in the prior year. Total Las Vegas segment revenues were up 4%, driven by higher occupancy and higher ADRs, which drove record cash hotel revenues, record gaming revenues and record food and beverage revenues. Excluding real payments, our Las Vegas segment generated $494 million of adjusted EBITDA with a margin of 44%. During the quarter, our group segment also delivered an all-time Q3 record for adjusted EBITDA. As we look to the remainder of the year, Las Vegas continues to benefit from strong leisure and casino guest demand, a robust events calendar and the continued strength of the group and convention segment. We're looking forward to the inaugural F1 race in November, the culmination of significant planning and infrastructure improvements executed by the city, in order to deliver a great event. Heading into \u201824, we are also excited for Las Vegas to host the Super Bowl in February, in addition to many other new and exciting events planned throughout the year. Las Vegas continues to benefit from one of the strongest event calendars in the United States. In our regional segment, revenues were up 2% versus last year, and adjusted EBITDA grew to $575 million, the best regional quarter on record. Stable guest demand, combined with excellent performance from our completed capital projects and newly opened facilities helped to offset competitive pressures in a few of our markets. Our regional segment is benefiting from a diversified portfolio across the United States. Turning to our capital projects. We are anticipating a Q4 opening for our Harrah\u2019s Hoosier Park property expansion, and we expect to have the new Versailles Tower rooms in Vegas, online by the end of the year. 2024 is a busy year, and we expect to complete the permanent facilities in Danville, Virginia and Columbus, Nebraska, as well as the new hotel tower and completely remodeled Caesars New Orleans project. We are looking forward to a strong finish to 2023. Consumer demand remains strong, and our capital projects are winding down. We will continue to remain focused on operating cost efficiencies, harvesting returns on project capital and driving long-term EBITDA growth. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work. Our success is a direct result of the dedication of our team members and their commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences every day. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric for some insights on the second quarter in our digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. During the third quarter, we delivered another positive adjusted EBITDA result and a significant improvement versus the same quarter last year. Caesars Digital generated $2 million of adjusted EBITDA versus a $38 million EBITDA loss last year, demonstrating significant and continued year-over-year flow-through improvements. Caesars represented a second consecutive quarter of EBITDA profitability in our Digital segment and makes us positive now on a trailing 12-month basis as well. During the quarter, online sports betting handle increased 14% and iCasino handle improved 38%. Revenues were negatively impacted by lower year-over-year hold in both our online sports betting and iCasino segments, which we believe to be temporary. We continue to remain balanced with our promotional spend during the quarter with a focus on investing in our best customers, resulting in an overall promotional spend being among the lowest in the industry. During the quarter, we delivered our new stand-alone iCasino app, Caesars Palace Online, the product features enhanced game content and functionality in addition to facilitating segmented marketing. The results of which drove monthly GGR and NGR in its first full month of operation to a record. We anticipate realizing increasingly positive results in the months ahead. Turning to online sports betting. We launched several new product features for football, including SGPs for NCAA, a live streaming product for nationally broadcast NFL games, a bet with reward credits feature and improved payment options. As we head into 2024, we believe that our product in both sports betting and iCasino are significantly improved from prior periods and quite competitive. We have an exciting and robust technology plan, which will have a focus on retention enhancements. I will preview these with you over the coming calls. But initially, we plan to continue to roll out our proprietary TAM, which will enable a shared wallet and to improve the customer experience through enhanced application stability, ease of use and app speed. We now offer sports betting in 30 North American jurisdictions, 24 of which offer mobile wagering. We also operate iCasino in six jurisdictions. I'll now pass the call back to Bret for additional comments. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Year-to-date, we've applied over $700 million of cash flow to debt reduction and the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in our Baltimore asset. Our leverage continues to reduce as we repay debt and grow EBITDA, with our total net leverage under our bank credit facility declining to 3.9 times as of September 30, resulting in a 25 bps reduction in our term loan A and revolver spreads to 150 bps over SOFR. Cash CapEx, excluding Atlantic City and our joint venture project spend, is expected to land at just over $800 million for 2023. We're looking forward to posting a strong fourth quarter heading into 2024. Over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. The group has detailed, it was an extremely strong quarter for us, all-time record for the company. Those of you who've been on calls, going back for quite some time. This should be a familiar story for you. Vegas remains quite strong in terms of headwinds in Vegas in the quarter. Know that we are accruing for the anticipated expenses that will come with the new union contract, which I will touch on a little bit more momentarily. We had Rio left the system on October 2. So kind of -- went out the door, in terms of how it was performing in the third quarter. We had more significant disruption in the Versailles Tower than we anticipated. We thought we were going to keep a fair amount of it active. But as you open the walls of a building that is as dated as that particular building, you find all sorts of surprises. We took the whole tower out of service, so fewer rooms, labor cost headwinds, Rio as a drag. We still beat year-over-year. The margin -- the slight margin reaction you see is related to labor costs, as Rio comes offline October 2, you should expect us to recover that margin percentage, if not more going forward. I know there will be questions on the union contract. We are in active dialogue with the unions. I'm involved with the union. I'm involved personally in the discussions. I'm optimistic we will reach a solution. You've heard me say before, we have done quite well as a company post-merger, post-pandemic, our employees should and will participate in that. So you should expect that when we reach agreement on a contract, it's going to be the largest increase that our employees have seen in the four decades since we started interacting with the culinary Union. So that's well deserved. It's anticipated in our business model. And as I said, everybody should be participating in the results that we've been delivering. In terms of regional, I know that a lot of you are expecting fairly dramatic moves in terms of what's happening with the customer. have been for many, many months, if not quarters, by this point. That's not what we're seeing. We're seeing stability in the customer. We're seeing weakness in properties that have competitive openings that we've named before, Tunica, Chicago market being chief among them. If you want to hang your hat on something that feels soft, Atlantic City feels soft, but that's not particularly news at this point. The returns from our projects that have come online like Charles, Virginia, Horseshoe Indianapolis have been quite strong and have offset the weakness in the properties that are competitively impacted. And as you saw, we set an all-time quarterly record for EBITDA and margin was stable. So we feel very good about regional, I would point to -- moving forward New Orleans is in the midst of the significant construction project that we've got going on there. It's particularly disruptive now and for the next quarter or two, basically one-third of the floor, the casino floor is tore up on any given day as we run -- as we do the heavy work at that level, we topped off the hotel tower. We're on target to open that expansion completely, well in advance of Super Bowl of \u201825. And we also have, obviously, F1 coming to Vegas, feel very, very good and no change in what we're expecting in terms of lift in the quarter in the neighborhood of 5%, which is what I told you a year ago, we'd expect to deliver that. At the high end, the amount of credit play that we have in the market, that week will exceed New Year's Eve. So it's an extraordinary event from a high-end perspective, Super Bowl and Vegas is filling in the same way, extremely strong high end as well. So we feel very good about those events. Digital, Eric touched on, our hold continues to grow in excess of 30%. You know that, that's based on the way we've been operating, that's not promotional-driven. That's actual handle growth. We got dinged on hold in the quarter but still delivered a positive EBITDA quarter. We're particularly pleased with the way the fourth quarter has begun in digital. Excited about the momentum that we've got in online casino now that we've launched Caesars Palace Online and what we'll be able to deliver in the coming quarters. As we have discussed, we are nearing the end of a significant capital cycle. So as New Orleans winds down, you should expect our project CapEx budget to come down. Our EBITDA is growing in both brick-and-mortar and digital. So our free cash flow is growing. We continue to use our free cash flow to pay down debt and reduce leverage. That's what you should expect until we see leverage in the 4 times or below lease-adjusted area. So we feel very, very good about how the business is performing how it's coming together, looking forward, we feel very good about what we see in front of us. We see, of course, the volatility that you see in share prices in the space, not just us. It's not reflective of what's going on in the business. And we're just going to keep delivering numbers until that volatility subsides. And we expect the market to recognize the value in our equity. And with that, I'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, guys. Thank you. Anthony, I believe you were talking about some of the event calendar for 2024 as it pertain to Las Vegas. I was wondering if you could perhaps provide -- kind of an update on where you guys are in terms of group pace and how you're thinking about kind of -- in the year, for the year experienced this year relative to what you could perhaps see next year? Anthony Carano : Yes. Thanks, Carlo. Group pace, as we said, set a record in this quarter, we see an extremely positive calendar going into getting better by the day. I think mix is around 15% to 16% this year, should pace up to about high teens next year. Carlo Santarelli : Perfect. And then, obviously, you guys benefited from some of the favorable baccarat results in the market in the 3Q. I was just wondering, I mean, we've seen a pretty healthy stretch here of materially higher baccarat holds. Is there anything that your folks are noticing just in terms of the changing dynamics that we seem to be seeing coming out of -- at least the Nevada published data as it pertains to baccarat? Anthony Carano : No, we had a really good quarter in baccarat last quarter, Q2. Q3 normalized for us. We're seeing a really strong return of the international customer, a diversified return of the international customer, and we think that will continue to grow this quarter with F1. A lot of interest in international for both F1 and the Super Bowl. And then anticipating a great New Year's and Chinese New Year's for next year, for international. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you. Tom Reeg : Carlo, on a consolidated basis for the quarter, hold didn't have a material impact one way or another for us. Carlo Santarelli : Yes. No, no, no. No, I was just referring to the baccarat piece specifically and more of the market data that you -- I think you guys said. Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. You may proceed Joe Greff : Good afternoon, guys. I want to lead off with a question for Eric here. Obviously, a significant increase in iGaming, handle up 38% year-over-year, and that's great. Can you talk about the path for growth from here? What are some of the drivers to continue that accelerating momentum, particularly when you think about other brands or reskinned apps and how that could drive growth there, Eric. Eric Hession : Yes, sure. Thanks, Joe. Yes, we feel like from a volume perspective, we had a very solid quarter, both sports and iCasino, up 38%. And keep in mind, during the quarter, we didn't have our app with the exception of basically for one month as we were putting it in for the first two months of the quarter. So again, most of the upside from the new app is going to accrue in the fourth quarter and into next year. We feel that there's a lot of opportunity to improve the integration of the various game vendors that will give us more insight into the actual workings of the game and see what customers are playing and where the spins are. We also have an opportunity to improve our CRM. As we mentioned during prior calls up to about a couple of months ago, we weren't able to do segmented marketing. And so now with our new app and with some of the new technology, we feel like that's going to really benefit us heading into next year. And then to your point, we are exploring the possibilities of adding another skin to the portfolio, as there are a number of states where we have additional licenses that we've reserved and would plan to potentially roll that out later in 2024. So all of those things contributing to the overall improvement, but what I would say is that the thesis of the new iCasino app is following exactly the script. We're seeing a much higher percentage of slot players, which if you recall on our prior app, it was heavily table focused, and then as a result, we're seeing improved hold in that particular app, which we think over time will ultimately create a whole lot more value for us. Joe Greff : Great. And then a question for you, going back to Las Vegas in the third quarter, casino revenue flat year-over-year. Food and Beverage hotel and other, all up to varying degrees nicely year-over-year. Table game drop, was down 6%. Was there anything specific to there, Anthony, or Tom, that you would call out, in the Q you do reference that the Las Vegas segment had faced some challenges related to construction disruption and road work on the Strip. Obviously, it didn't impact food and beverage and hotel to what extent was that a driver? Tom Reeg : I mean you could name a lot of things that impact that, but a big impact on casino revenue has shifted mix out of your database or tour travel into group business. Those customers spend more money outside of the casino floor than those that they're placing. So you're going to see some of that, you wouldn't really -- and obviously, table games drop particularly in Caesars Palace, where we are today is dependent on when your big customers come and visit. And so there's -- I don't want to say seasonality, but there's volatility in that number based on when those customers show up. Joe Greff : Great. And then just related to Las Vegas, Tom, do you think you benefited at all from a competitor's cybersecurity issue, which may have hurt them or which definitely hurt them based on their disclosures. Did you have an outsized benefit that you would call out? Tom Reeg : No, I wouldn't call out a benefit, I would tell you. One thing I know for certain after this quarter is nobody benefits from a cybersecurity incident. Joe Greff : Thank you, guys. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo, you may proceed. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon. First, this is maybe for Tom or Anthony. As you think about next year and we're kind of rounding out this year here, how do you think about the growth in the segment -- between the segments as it relates to Las Vegas and regional, obviously, Tom, you mentioned in Las Vegas, you're seeing the Versailles Tower, maybe shifted a little bit later than anticipated. And then in the regional segment, you have new properties ramping but also some new competition. So any high-level thoughts preliminarily as we think about the growth path here next year? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'd say on the Versailles Tower, timing really hasn't changed. What changed is, we had to take far more rooms out of service than we anticipated before we started opening up walls. We'll still -- as Anthony said, be getting rooms back before the end of the year. We think that's a driver in Las Vegas. I would be -- we're in the middle of budgeting right now. And I would say if you're budgeting modest growth in both Vegas and regional and significant growth in digital, you're consistent with what we're thinking. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just pivoting to digital a bit, I mean, this is a business where I think it seems like from an operating expense perspective, it looks like you've really reached scale there. As you think about the path forward here. Are there any rules of thumb or high-level ways to think about the flow through, just as it looks like you've turned the corner in terms of the cost structure? Eric Hession : Yes. I'm happy to give you a few thoughts. One of the things that I think we're particularly proud of over the last few quarters is that we've been able to hold our promotional spending constant and even down. This quarter, it was down 25 basis points versus prior year. And so it's staying in that range that we've kind of given you for guidance, of the 1% to 1.25% of volume. And so I think that's one thing to help build the models. If you look at our tax rate, along with the payments processing fees and a few other variable costs that we have, using 50% or thereabouts in terms of incremental flow-through is a good number to use. I think you're probably right about thinking where we're kind of essentially at that point where we've covered all of our fixed costs now and the marketing spend is still coming down. We were down about $50 million year-over-year this quarter versus same quarter last year. And that will start to kind of stabilize as we've pulled a lot of it out, with the exception of some of the league and other longer-term commitments coming out over the next year. But from a variable perspective, I would think you could take every incremental dollar and flow 50% through at this point. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much for the detail. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed. Steven Wieczynski : Yes. Hey, guys, good afternoon. So Tom, as we think about 2024 in Vegas, maybe from a cost perspective, you're obviously going to have some labor pressure heading into next year, depending on how the labor negotiations end up. But as we think about flow-through for 2024 in that market, anything we should be thinking about on the positive side that could potentially offset some of that wage inflation? Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean you've got continued shift into group business, which is higher margin for us. So if you look at Caesars, it was historically running at 14% or so, we're up a couple of points above that. We should be up a couple more points next year. That brings more banquet revenue that brings higher room rate, which has very high flow-through. We've got -- Versailles Tower comes online as we've discussed. We'd expect that, that's 15%, 20% ROI at a minimum on a $100 million project. So we have wind at our sales in addition to -- more than offsetting what you're noting on the cost side. And you've seen that even in third quarter, which had a number of headwinds, and we still posted growth in a quarter that's not particularly strong from a group perspective. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. And then, Tom, in the past, I mean, actually as early as last quarter, you've laid out a path to $5 billion EBITDA by 2025. I'm just wondering, as you sit here today, is there anything out there that you're seeing that would impede you guys from getting somewhere around that target? And I'm guessing you're going to give me a one-word answer of no, but just wanted to check back in and kind of see how you're feeling about that target today. Tom Reeg : Yes, Steve, I told you that I think there's $0.5 billion of opportunity in brick-and-mortar, $0.5 billion of opportunity in digital, and we still see that in front of us. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, great. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may proceed. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I feel like one of the themes from the kind of quarter has rolled out so far is just broader operating expense inflation. You obviously -- I mean, based on just what we saw out of the regional margins alone, it seemed like you're able to find offsets to be able to kind of counteract that. But could you just outline a little bit more broadly, maybe kind of what expense pressures you're seeing in the business? And do you think you've got the ability -- kind of going forward to be able to offset that and hold or get close to at least holding margins across the regional segments? Tom Reeg : Yes, Shaun. I mean, I think you've seen it for quite some time. You saw it this quarter. we've been good at this for a very long time. This is -- kind of how we built the business was being as good as we could be at blocking and tackling. And recall that we're still, seems like it's been forever, but it's been three years since we closed the merger. We're constantly continuing to find new opportunity to squeeze cash flow out of the business. The cost pressures that you're hearing from us and others in terms of labor and inflation-related costs, those aren't new. We've been dealing with those kind of since we got out of the pandemic. And we have said all along that we think our margins are -- you shouldn't expect significant degradation margin and you haven't seen that to date. So that's what I'd expect going forward. Shaun Kelley : And then, maybe pivoting to Las Vegas, and I appreciate the comments that you make, especially given the sensitivity around the union side. Just -- kind of anything further you could provide to us around timing, as we kind of do get ever closer to Formula 1? And then just -- are the accruals that I believe you're already taking in the quarter, are those in line with your comment about -- the kind of step function in costs that you expect that contract to ultimately yield? Tom Reeg : Yes. You should expect that we're accruing at a level that we think is consistent with where the contract will shake out. So it's consistent with our view that our employees deserve what they're going to get here, and we intend to provide. In terms of timing, we're in active dialogue. I don't want to be delivering a play-by-play. This is a five-year contract. So while it seems like, gee, why don't you just get it done next week. These are complex contracts that cover a long period of time, and we're going to do the work with the union to make sure that we do it right for all parties. And I can't tell you if that means it's going to happen next week, a couple of weeks from now or a month from now. But we are in dialogue constantly with the union and have further meetings this week. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. You may proceed. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, everybody and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the strong results. Tom, your comment on the regional consumer, loud and clear, that it's stable. Obviously, people are a little bit nervous on this particular segment. I was wondering if you could just go a cut deeper on what you're seeing and maybe talk about sort of -- maybe the month-to-month throughout the quarter or spend per visit trends, utilization of loyalty rewards across your system? Anything that I can kind of -- put a finer point on that? Tom Reeg : Yes. So Brandt, I'd say, I don't have anything intelligent to say about month-to-month. There's not a particular month that stood out for us. What we are seeing is, in markets that are not impacted by new competition, save for Atlantic City, you're seeing demand kind of equal to last year to, let's call it, plus or minus 2%, if you're looking across the whole portfolio, something that averages to a little bit of growth across those assets from a revenue standpoint. Then you have assets that are competitively impacted like Tunica, like the Chicago market that are very different from a revenue and EBITDA perspective. They're under pressure. And then you've got properties where we were the new supply, whether either to a new project like Charles or Virginia, or an expansion like Indiana and our revenue and EBITDA is going up. And the net result of that is what you saw in the business for the quarter, that EBITDA grew and EBITDA margin was flat. And that's really been the case for about a year now for us. Every quarter, we run into kind of, well, now it's got to be right around the corner, and we're just not seeing that. We saw the well-documented surge in unrated play with stimulus checks a couple of years ago, unrated play is where you see the volatility, but our database is strong enough that it's able to withstand that decline in unrated play back from the pandemic or to the stimulus day. So we feel very good about where we sit in our regional business. And remember, this is -- the logic behind pursuing Caesars as a target in M&A was, diversification is going to be a strength of the company. And that's what we've seen from a broad perspective, you saw as the pandemic ended, people didn't want to get on a plane, and regionals carried Vegas, then regionals had the tough comp versus stimulus and Vegas carried regionals. Now you have both of them kind of bumping along as modest growers, and we have digital kicking in. And within regional, we've got diversification across our portfolio. And we hear what's said by others. We heard one of our competitors in Reno say, Reno is off because there's an international competitor. I don't know who that is because we had our best quarter ever in Reno. So I would just tell you that the diversification that we thought was going to be a huge asset for the company continues to prove itself to us, and we hope, to you. Brandt Montour : That's super helpful. Thanks for that. And then over in digital, several weeks now into the NFL season, wondering if you were seeing anything from the competitive landscape that's surprising at all, from promotional advertising perspective. And then if you could separate by related, if you could just update us on your overall confidence levels of hitting that digital EBITDA target in '25? That would be great. Tom Reeg : Yes. So the target has not changed. We continue to see a visible path to that end. And each quarter, we grow more confident. We're not seeing anything promotionally that's requiring us to respond. I'll let others talk about their own promo strategies. We huddle each other once in a while and say, look at this, look at that. But -- we've kind of got our head down executing on our business model and driving that $500 million of EBITDA, which again would be a about a 50% return on the cumulative EBITDA losses our shareholders allowed us to invest in the business today. So we feel very, very confident about where we are in this business. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. You may proceed. Barry Jonas : Hey, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about next steps, maybe any updated expectations for the New York land-based casino process. I believe one bidder is exiting that process. And while we're at it, maybe any general thoughts on the potential for iGaming in New York as well. Tom Reeg : Yes. So tongue and cheek, I'd say I don't have grandkids yet, but I'm hoping it's awarded before my first grandkid is 25 years old. It's going slowly. They've just passed the second round of questions. The deadline for that, so then I'll answer all the questions. Then you get into the community board process where you've got to -- they'll put out the RFP, you've got to be approved by your community Board. Those that are approved by their community boards will have an opportunity to submit the final application for the license. As I sit here today, I think the quickest that they could issue a license based on what needs to be accomplished between now and then, is the end of 2024. I would say, my personal expectation is it's 2025 before a license is on. Barry Jonas : Got it. And then just a follow-up on digital. I appreciate the comments on low hold in the quarter, reversing. I guess you've talked in the past about -- maybe expectations for holds for bridging the gap with competitors. So just curious if any updated thoughts there and sort of the timing to narrow that gap? Eric Hession : Yes, sure. I'll jump in on this one. We continue to see the -- an end point where we're going to have hold in the 7.5% to 8% range. If you look at this quarter in particular, we did continue to have sequential hold improvement for the last four quarters, actually. It's really just -- we had an anomaly in Q3 of last year, where we held almost 200 basis points on the sports betting side higher than any other quarter in the two years. So it's really just a reversal of that period. And that was primarily driven by the September last year football results, which then reversed this year. But we're steadily improving on that path. It is important to note that if you look at last year's, our blended hold was around 5.5%. So if you increase it by 200 basis points, on the volumes that we're producing, you're talking, a couple of hundred million more of incremental GGR, which at those flow-through rates that we talked about, should be a big contributor towards the EBITDA. And as I mentioned, we're heading steadily in that direction. So that's one of those areas that it's in the model to get to the $500 million, we have to execute on it, but it's not particularly dependent on either the consumer changing behavior or are our competitors doing something differently. We just need to execute on that. Barry Jonas : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Stephen Grambling : Hey, thanks. I know in the past, you've talked about hitting the 4 turns of leverage and then keeping M&A in the toolkit. Would love to hear -- as you look at the broader environment, obviously, there's been a lot of market volatility. Is that increase the likelihood of any popping up? Or do you say, look, at this point, buying back your own stock makes the most sense? Tom Reeg : Yes. So thanks for the question. So the uses of free cash flow that are available to us are, deleveraging something internal from a growth capital perspective, something external from an M&A perspective or buying my stock. When we had the conversation last quarter our stock was right around $60 and going up as we sit here today, closed around $40 today. At that free cash flow yield, it's going to be very difficult for me to find an external opportunity that I have the same level of conviction I'd have in terms of driving returns in buying my stock at a 15%-plus free cash flow yield. So when we get to our the -- toward the end of the New Orleans project and leverage gets to our target. If I can drive the kind of free cash flow returns we could drive with our stock at $40, I'd much more likely be a buyer of our stock than using it in an acquisition where I'm effectively selling it. So it's going to depend on where we sit. Those are the tools available in the toolkit, but the stock at this level is very clearly the best alternative. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And perhaps a change in topic, but on iGaming, I think you referenced a bit of a pivot to more slot play. Is that effectively a different customer as we think about iGaming on tables versus slots and -- is always the question of, is that impacting at all the brick-and-mortar customer and/or properties, are you still seeing incremental customers coming from digital? Tom Reeg : Yes. So the answer is yes. It's -- the customer that showed up in our iGaming business before through our sports betting tab tended to be a sports better, which skews younger and male and table games player. If you look at the businesses, we want to emulate in the iGaming arena, they look like our brick-and-mortar business in terms of skewing to slots and older and female. And since we've launched Caesars Palace Online, that's exactly what we've seen in that app. So very encouraging. In terms of early days results. In terms of cannibalization, we have seen nothing to date in terms of cannibalizing the brick-and-mortar business. It's been accretive to brick-and-mortar in that -- customers that we found through digital or reactivated in digital, showing up in brick-and-mortar continues to increase as the quarters pass. So very pleased with how that business is developing. I know that it's early stage since we've launched Caesars Palace Online, but extremely encouraged by results. Stephen Grambling : Helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Tom Reeg : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John DeCree with CBRE. You may proceed. John DeCree : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one back on iGaming. And I know most of your peers, competitors don't really -- they'll provide active user information. But from your response to your prior questions, it sounds like with the shift in demographics, are you seeing a meaningful increase in active users or frequency of play from customers? Or are you more seeing -- since you've launched a stand-alone app, higher-paying customers come in or a mix of both? Any kind of color you could provide around those trends would be helpful. Tom Reeg : Yes. You're seeing all the above. You're seeing more active play. You're seeing increase in customers and you're seeing better customers coming into our network. So it's been, as I said, an encouraging start. John DeCree : Thanks, Tom. And maybe to pivot back to the M&A potential question. I guess bigger picture, and I imagine the answer is potential target specific, but given the margin improvements that the industry realized, post-pandemic, when you look at possible targets? Do you still see an opportunity for meaningful synergies or efficiencies that you and your team could find, it might make an M&A target, particularly accretive when valuing that against the free cash yield of your stock today? I mean, are there still some opportunities that you think you can harvest some additional EBITDA growth from? Tom Reeg : Yes. I would say the risk of running out of opportunities where we think we can squeeze more EBITDA out of assets than a target is very, very low on my list of reasons why M&A might not happen. John DeCree : Fair enough. Appreciate that. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. You may proceed. David Katz : Hi, everyone. Thanks for working me in. I wanted to just go back to Vegas and the Vegas margins in particular because Tom, you laid out some items, in your earlier remarks about accruals about Rio leaving, about side disrupting a little more than expected. Are you able to quantify that for us? And the nature of the question is always -- just trying to find what the normal Vegas margin is going to be with a lot of the noise going on. Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'd say what I can quantify is, Rio is a little over $40 million of revenue with 0 EBITDA, maybe even the way it runs, it was less than 0, since you had to run the lease payment through it. So we had -- with that coming out, that's a significant move in reduction in revenue increase in EBITDA with it out of the system. I don't -- again, don't want to touch on any details of the new contracts, we're in dialogue. And in terms of Versailles, really you're seeing rooms that were out of service that will come back online by the end of the year. So you can presume that versus third quarter last year, that was a margin headwind. And coming back online at a higher average rate should be accretive to margins going forward. David Katz : Got it. And if I can just follow-up with Eric on the digital side. One of the observations today is that product is winning, things such as parlays and in-game and other kinds of features and functionality. How would you characterize your arc in -- sort of being caught up with the leaders in terms of doing that and presuming that you do have to do that in order to accomplish your goals? Or am I misreading that? Eric Hession : Yes. I think it's a great question. I think you're right. Product is quite important. It's -- I think it manifests itself mostly in retention because, trial, you can get that right away. And then it's a question of how much people are going to continue to play and then how much they play once they do. From our perspective, I think we've made a lot of steps in the last two years, and I feel like our product is comparable to the top products that are out there, not quite to the level. There are still some pieces of functionality that we just haven't developed yet or focused on. But having the same-game parlays, for the NCAA, having live same-game parlays, having alternative line SGPs out there were big steps, rolling those out for the NBA coming up, and then getting that same action into hockey and so forth are some of the things that we still need to close the gap on. But broadly speaking, I feel like if a customer came to our app, the benefits that we have with Caesars Rewards with a lot of the other things that we can offer that some of our competitors can't. The app is going to allow them to stay with us and become a loyal customer. Whereas I think if you were to say that same thing about a year or 1.5 years ago, that may not have been the case. David Katz : Got it. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. You may proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Sam on for Chad. First one is for Eric. Wanted to ask about the watch and bet streaming feature that you launched for NFL this season? And have you seen any changes in customer engagement or betting behavior from implementing this feature so far, and any thoughts around adding this feature for other sports? Eric Hession : Yes. We're very excited to be one of the few operators to -- basically, trial this for the NFL and our partners. We do see uptick in terms of customers watching it on our app, we we're able to measure how many people are viewing it and so forth. The next big step is going to be able to overlay wagering opportunities while customers are watching it. That we don't have yet. It's under development, and that's why we still consider this to kind of be a trial. So in terms of customer behavior change, at this point, we're still waiting for more data to be able to determine that. But a lot of the benefit that we feel we're getting out of this is the -- on the tech side, being able to integrate it, working with the data feed providers and then being able to measure how the customers are using it. Those will be the real benefits coming, going forward. In terms of doing it for other sports, we're definitely interested in doing that. It really depends on what the leagues' policies are and how they plan to utilize that service. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then perhaps for Tom, recent market data showed that Las Vegas RevPAR growth has trended well into the double digits in October. Just wanted to get your view, given what you're seeing today in terms of bookings, consumer behavior, the return of conferences and the overall events calendar in '24. Where do you think Strip RevPAR growth can get to in '24 or at least in the first half of '24? Tom Reeg : We're optimistic about the Strip generally, the group calendar ahead of us. I would -- we don't really have much room and occupancy anymore. We've just reported almost 97% occupancy for the quarter. So it will come in late. You'll see that as we shift mix more into group and feel very good about '24 from that perspective. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. You may proceed. Daniel Guglielmo : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. So the first one, just -- in the Q you gave a guide for maintenance project spend, it looks like the midpoint of that spend went up around $40 million versus last quarter. Is that just construction and labor coming in higher than expected? Or have there been changes to the plans to close out the year? Bret Yunker : Yes. We just caught up on some deferred spend from last year into this year. So slightly accelerated above pace within the calendar year spend on maintenance. Daniel Guglielmo : Okay. And then just going back to the table game drop for the brick-and-mortar portfolio. I know we talked about Vegas earlier, but it's also slowed year-to-date on the regional side, and it seems like cable game traffic volumes have diverged from slots in both segments. Is there anything there around certain demographics or a piece of the database not showing up or playing differently, and do table game players tend to be younger than slot players in a brick-and-mortar? Tom Reeg : So the answer to the last question is no. The players across a regional casino don't have particularly differences, differences in ages, in terms of tables across the enterprise, I can't point to any specific changes in behavior that's -- what number we're looking at, at... Brian Agnew : Table games drop in Vegas and regionally, was down versus slot volumes up. Tom Reeg : Yes. I don't really have anything intelligent to say about that, most of our regional properties, table games, a fairly small piece of the business. Regional business is driven by slot revenue much more so than Vegas. Daniel Guglielmo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joe Stauff with SIG. You may proceed. Joe Stauff : Thank you for taking the questions. I just had two, maybe on digital. We can see some references of your reduction in OSB spend. And just wondering, is it fair to assume, is that a permanent reduction as you think about -- sort of your OSB product? Or is it likely that you'll just reallocate that spend? And I'm talking about, I\u2019d say, customer acquisition retention to your new iCasino first product. I know it's still ramping, so it's probably not 1 :1, but just wondering how to think about that strategy going forward? And then maybe to see how Nevada did in the third quarter, you had just launched a new app, your new app in Nevada. Just wondering if, year-over-year that was up. Tom Reeg : Yes. So Joe, in terms of Nevada, yes, as we moved from CBS to Liberty and the functionality of our app that you see everywhere else, what we saw was an increase in hold, increase in volume, increase in average bets per user. What you would expect to see in terms of a -- call it, this generation product versus a prior generation product. In terms of what we're doing in promo, you should expect that there's going to be some spend that we've talked about in terms of launching iCasino. But given the way iCasino works in the amount of states, there's nothing in the -- in terms of the intensity that you see in OSB states. So you'll see some launch spend there, but you should expect OSB will be pretty stable for us. As Eric said, we've been kind of 1.25% of handles for quite a while now over a year, and we'd expect that to remain the case. Permanent is a long time. So I can't tell you it will never change, but we feel good about where we're at. Joe Stauff : And maybe just one follow-up. For iCasino, are you largely just mining your large loyalty database for, let's say, cross-promotional type of customer? What are you seeing thus far in that? Eric Hession : Yes. I would say, broadly speaking, our database is more responsive to the new app as you would hope and as you'd expect. When we built it, it was designed to be much more similar to a traditional casino experience. That said, we continue to get the majority of the customers that are trialing the app from other sources. So it comes from paid search, paid social affiliates, and then just from brand recognition and advertising that people trial the app. So it's a good mix right now. I think over time, our real differentiator, though, is the ability to cross-sell between online and bricks and mortar. And so we're eagerly looking forward to working with the soft providers to provide games and promos and jackpots that span both brick-and-mortar and digital. Joe Stauff : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Tom Reeg for any closing remarks. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks, everybody. We will see you, I'm sure, at some conferences between now and then, but happy holidays. We'll see after first quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. Brian Agnew : Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. A copy of those results are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. As usual, joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our CEO; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bret Yunker, our CFO; Eric Hession, President, Caesars Sports and Online Gaming; and Charise Crumbley from Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and these statements may or may not come true. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. Please visit our press releases located at our Investor Relations website for a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure. I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We generated consolidated net revenue growth and stable year-over-year adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. Results were driven by significant year-over-year growth in revenues and adjusted EBITDA in our digital segment. As previously disclosed in our preannounced results during January, our Las Vegas segment experienced several one-time headwinds during the quarter that negatively impacted results, which Tom will quantify in more detail. For the full year on a consolidated same-store basis, Caesars generated 7% revenue growth and 22% adjusted EBITDA growth. All of our operating segments delivered revenue growth in 2023, and our brick-and-mortar properties delivered stable EBITDA. Caesars Digital produced a breakout year with 77% revenue growth and $38 million of full-year adjusted EBITDA. Despite the headwinds in Las Vegas during the quarter, our Las Vegas segment delivered $489 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q4 and $2 billion for the full year, up from $1.4 billion in 2019 on a same-store basis. 2023 in Las Vegas was a year driven by record occupancy and record ADRs throughout our portfolio. Strong occupancy and ADRs led to records in cash hotel revenues and food and beverage results. Our group segment set another adjusted EBITDA record in 2023 and increased occupied room nights to 17% of our mix in Las Vegas. While we clearly had a strong year in Las Vegas, we remain optimistic for 2024 and beyond. Forward occupancy and ADRs remain strong, and the outlook for group and convention remains encouraging. The event calendar in Las Vegas remains robust, and we expect to build upon 2023 momentum for several key events. In our regional segment in Q4, we delivered $431 million of adjusted EBITDA, down 3% versus last year, driven by new competition in a few markets we have discussed before, and construction disruption in New Orleans and Harrah's Hoosier Park, partially offset by new openings in Danville, Virginia and Columbus Nebraska. For the full year, our regional segment delivered $5.8 billion in revenues and $1.96 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Similar to Q4, annual results were driven by new property openings, offset by new competition in certain markets, construction disruption at a few properties, and the negative impact of poor weather. In 2024, we will finish several construction projects that we expect to generate strong returns and will complete an elevated CapEx cycle for the company. The permanent facility in Columbus Nebraska should be open by mid-year, construction in New Orleans should finish by Labor Day, and the permanent facility in Danville is expected to open by year-end. All three of these projects will deliver strong returns on capital to drive growth in our regional segment. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work in 2023. Our strong results are a reflection of their dedication to delivering exceptional guest service. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Eric for some insights on the fourth quarter and full year performance in our digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. On our Q4 call last year, I talked about how the benefits of scaling net revenues in our digital segment would drive improved profitability given the high flow-through nature of the business. This transpired as strong revenue growth in Q4 and for the full year of 2023 led to several notable records within our digital business. Net revenues for Q4 grew 28% to a new quarterly record of $304 million and the segment generated $29 million of adjusted EBITDA, also a record. On a hold adjusted basis, we estimate that the segment would have delivered close to $60 million of adjusted EBITDA during Q4. Sports betting volumes during the quarter grew over 12% with a hold rate of 6.4%, up year-over-year but negatively impacted by November hold coming in below our expected range. iGaming growth accelerated throughout the quarter and delivered over 50% growth in volume led by Caesars Palace Online, which contributed to our first quarter of $100 million in GGR for the segment. For the full year of 2023, our Digital segment achieved 78% net revenue growth to $973 million, a new annual record and $38 million of full year adjusted EBITDA, also an annual record. On the sports betting side, during 2023, we continued to focus our product and technology improvements on the overall experience for our customers. They responded favorably to improved same-game parlays product enhancements, in-game wagering improvements and streaming technology. The percentage of customers making parlay wagers continues to improve and the average legs per wager also continues to steadily increase, giving us confidence in our ability to improve hold throughout 2024. On the iCasino side, we introduced our new Caesars Palace online app in August of 2023. Results to date are very encouraging as we've seen active customer counts and volume growth grow sequentially each month. The core iCasino slot customer has responded positively to our significantly improved offering, and we're pleased that the new product and brand resonate much better with our Caesars Rewards database than our casino associated with the Sportsbook. iGaming remains a critical component of our digital growth strategy for 2024 and beyond. In support of that strategy, after the market closed, we announced an agreement with the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and Wynn Resorts to enable a second iGaming brand in Michigan, which we plan to launch before the end of the year pending regulatory approvals. The existing Wynn operations have been averaging approximately $3 million of GDR per month, and we will work with their team to transition the customer base to our newly branded product when we launch. Following regulatory approvals, we will have secured market access for a second brand in every jurisdiction where we currently offer the Caesars Palace Online iCasino, which allows our new brand to benefit fully from the scale. We now offer sports betting in 31 North American jurisdictions, 25 of which offer mobile wagering. I'm very pleased with the progress we made in 2023. If you recall, our objective was to drive a solid return on investment for our shareholders as our business grew and matured over time. Our thesis was grounded on a reasonable TAM, an early effort to build brand awareness and harvesting the benefits of a very scalable business with a high portion of fixed costs. Our performance in 2023 sets the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead and keeps us on our path towards achieving $500 million of adjusted EBITDA. I'll now pass the call over to Bret for additional comments on Q4 in the full year. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. To put a bow on 2023 we ended the year with net debt of $11.4 billion and net leverage of under four times. 2023 CapEx spend, excluding AC and our Danville joint venture came in at $900 million. In January we refinanced our 2025 debt stack and eliminated the CRC credit entity, pushing $4.4 billion of maturities into 2031 and beyond at highly attractive interest rates. Pro forma for the transaction, roughly half of our debt is now floating rate, which will benefit our free cash flow as the rate cycle turns to cuts going forward. 2024 CapEx, excluding Danville, which is funded at the JV level, is expected to be $800 million. Over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. To touch briefly on the fourth quarter results, I know we pre-released about a month ago, so they've been out there. If you look at the Caesars specific items that were going on in the quarter to get toward \u2013 where do we come run rating out of the quarter, we had in Vegas, recall that we were accruing for the new union contract that was signed in the fourth quarter. The accruals that we had put in place since June 1 were not quite at the level where the contract ultimately landed. So there is a catch up payment in there. The Versailles Tower that we were transforming at Horseshoe into the Versailles Tower at Paris, those rooms were entirely offline in the quarter, so we had 65,000 fewer room nights at over a $200 ADR. And sports has been well documented away from us, November hold was historically in players\u2019 favor. We quantified that to about $20 million in our pre release in EBITDA. And we had construction disruption, as Anthony says, in Indiana and New Orleans in the quarter. If you put all that into the blender and figure out where we came out, I have us set $975 million to a $1 billion of run rate EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We had stronger hold last year in Vegas than we did this year, both within our normal range, we were more middle of the range this year, high end of the range last year. That's not in those numbers that I gave you. But if you look at Vegas on any volume indicator, room revenue was up despite the fewer room nights, food and beverage revenue was up double digits. Slot handle was up, table drop was flat for us. As you'll recall in prior quarters, we talked about F1 as a big stimulator of demand for us. We had been talking about a 5% lift in EBITDA in the quarter from F1. Our actual experience was about a 4% lift. So pretty close to what we were expecting. It was a huge lift for the high-end properties in the market, as you've seen, including Caesars Palace and Paris for us, it was less so for mass market properties. But generally speaking, it was a phenomenal event for the market. It needs to get \u2013 obviously, that was the first year of the Grand Prix in Las Vegas. It was a gargantuan effort to pull-off a race at all as with anything of that scale where you launch, you learn, what would I do differently as we move forward. We know as Caesars that this will be a better event when more of the city is energized, not just the four or five buildings that garnered the brunt of the benefit. So we're working with our partners in the city and with F1 to make sure that it is a more broadly successful event next year than even the success that it was this year. Thinking about this year, as we look forward now, January was a debacle from a weather standpoint. I think that's well understood across the market, you had about three of the four weeks that were significantly weather impacted. So we and everybody else starts in a January hole. What's good about that is January is a seasonally slower month to begin with. I expect even with what went on in January, we'd expect growth from each of our three segments. I expect growth in Vegas and EBITDA, in regionals and EBITDA and in digital, with digital being the most dramatic in my expectation. If you look at what's going on in digital, we're particularly excited with what's happening in iCasino. I know we've talked about iCasino for a very long time. We're seeing the fruits of our labor there. Eric and Matt Sunderland and their team have done a fantastic job. You saw fourth quarter handle and revenue was up 50% plus. We continue to grow on a month-over-month basis from there. So we're accelerating from there. Caesars Palace Online, as Eric said, launched second half of the third quarter. It's already to the point where it's about the same level of revenue as the business that preceded it in Caesars and it has created the shift that we anticipated to more slot play, more skewed towards female, in line with our Caesars Reward database, that's a higher hold business as well. So our iCasino numbers are ramping very, very quickly and continuing to accelerate. Keep in mind that in the digital business, iCasino is a higher margin business than OSB. So that bodes well for us this year. And in terms of capital, free cash flow, recall that when we finished \u2013 when we completed the merger with Caesars, we had a number of big ticket items that were either committed to as part of the merger like this $400 million of spend in Atlantic City or had been committed to by either the Caesars side or El dorado side. Prior, we were rebuilding the Lake Charles property. We had \u2013 we extended the lease in New Orleans, and we're pursuing an expansion there that was tied to that lease extension. And we had been awarded the license in Danville, which has been a home run out-of-the-box. But chunky capital projects with really not much discretion involved with them. I'm pleased to say that we're reaching the other side of that in 2024, Atlantic City is in the rearview mirror, as is Lake Charles, the \u2013 I'm sorry, the Caesars New Orleans project, should open late third quarter, and the Danville project should open by the end of the year. So as we look to \u2013 by the time that Danville project opens, we have a significant reduction in CapEx as we move forward. Free cash flow should be continuing to improve, both from growth in EBITDA, reduction in CapEx, and as Bret said, our financing that we executed in January, if you think about this is the second consecutive January. Bret and his team have executed a $4.5 billion financing for us. Nobody really would have set up a balance sheet with $9 billion in 2025 maturities. But that\u2019s what the market allowed us to do when we came to finance Caesars in the middle of the pandemic. So that\u2019s what we dealt with. Last year, when rates were going up, we did $4.5 billion and shifted our fixed to floating interest ratio to 75% fixed, 25% floating as rates rose. This year, we reversed that, did the $4.5 billion now we\u2019re 50% floating, 50% fixed. So as we pay down debt and the Fed moves into the rate cutting regime that they are telegraphing free cash flow further improves for us. So we\u2019re very pleased with 2023. I\u2019d add my thank you and congratulations to our team members who delivered an unbelievable year for us, just shy of $4 billion of EBITDA lift of over$700 million from 2022. And we\u2019re excited for what 2024 holds for us. And with that, I\u2019ll open for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Joe Greff, your line is now open. Joe Greff : Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. Tom, going back to your comments on F1, can F1 be a successful non-high end event? Can it be a pretty good growth driver at the mid price point properties? How do you position market price the rooms at these properties differently in 2024 and beyond to drive growth? Tom Reeg : I think a key piece is the pricing of the actual event, Joe, the lowest end ticket was pricey by any definition as you looked at it. Last year, we\u2019re working with F1 and I\u2019d expect there is a \u2013 there will be more approachable participation at not the very highest end of the market. That\u2019s going to be helpful for properties that maybe didn\u2019t get to participate as much this year. We at Caesars certainly, and I know my discussions with MGM and Wynn, everybody is aware that if only a few buildings in the market benefit from this, it\u2019s not going to be a super long-term event. As I said, this was basically a full sprint to get the race in position. What F1 accomplished in terms of building the paddock in the time that they did was just extraordinary. And now we all get to look at what went well, what didn\u2019t go well, and that\u2019s a piece of what we think we can improve going forward. And I\u2019d expect it to be even better in 2024. Joe Greff : Great. And then just to get a sense of in Las Vegas, what type of operating expense growth you\u2019re anticipating, and maybe we can kind of think about it this way in level setting, say revenues growing at a flat pace in 2024 versus 2023. And I heard your comments about growth in the market, and I\u2019m sure in the 1Q with the Super Bowl and events, overall revenue growth is in positive territory year-over-year. But if we assume for full year 2024 that revenues are flat, how would you expect OpEx growth to perform? Tom Reeg : Joe, our OpEx growth is going to be mid-single digits in terms of largely the lift from labor expenses. We believe that in our portfolio, revenues will largely keep pace with that. So we would expect to see margins in the same zip code as we go through 2024. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, thank you, everyone. Eric, I was hoping I could ask, obviously you did a nice job, pretty fairly comprehensive job highlighting kind of the digital business to date. But if we\u2019re looking at simply on the iCasino side, you guys have seen acceleration in handle, acceleration in GGR in each quarter over 2023. Obviously, you\u2019ve rolled out some new things. How should we think about kind of framing the growth in handle GGR, however you want to think about it in 2024? And what are some of the incremental add-ons that, that you guys will have for 2024 to kind of continue to drive the story there? Eric Hession : Yes. Thanks, Carlo. We\u2019ve been very impressed with the performance that we\u2019ve realized so far on the Caesars Palace Online standalone casino. When you think about it, it was launched in August, and so it's really \u2013 it\u2019s kind of in its sixth or seventh month at this point. And to Tom's earlier comment, it's already 50% of our overall iCasino business. So we're still measuring that business on a month over month basis as we see double-digit growth in actives, in gaming revenue and gross gaming revenue and volume. And so I don't have any concerns at this point that the pace of growth on that particular business should slow, we keep getting great responses from the customers. In terms of what we have coming, we're still early in our direct integration phase, so we have just a couple of vendors from slot products that are directly integrated. We're going to continue that throughout the year. We're going to do at least three direct integrations a quarter, and that really helps with our game mix and the stability of the system. We also have a CRM product that we're putting in place at the end of this quarter, that'll really help us do some segmented marketing even further than what we're able to do right now. And then another exciting thing that we announce today is the second branded product that we'll be able to launch. Our expectation is that it'll be a unique brand in all of the markets where we operate, and we'll launch that towards the end of the year. And it'll provide an alternative for some of our customers to use, whether they prefer that brand over the Caesars Palace Online or they just prefer to mix things up and go back and forth between the brands. So between those three key drivers, we really expect the performance of the iCasino business to continue the trends that it's on. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you for that. And then, Tom, if I could just kind of follow-up on something Joseph asked. As you think about Las Vegas in 2024, and clearly, from a margin perspective last year, moving parts \u2013 there are certainly moving parts in the comparisons this year, you'll have five months of kind of the incremental labor expense the Super Bowl, obviously, in the first quarter last year, kind of lapping CON/AGG, et cetera. How do you think about kind of the ability to keep margins flat? Or do you just simply believe that's almost entirely reliant on revenue? Tom Reeg : No. Carlo, that we're never standing still, Sean McBurney, Anthony and their team have lists of items that we're working on, both from a revenue and expense standpoint that are accretive both from an EBITDA and margin standpoint. So we just don't stand and take a shot to the ribs and hope it works out. We're working to, frankly, improve our margins from here. We're really not thinking about degradation in margins. And we understand that the cost of the new union contract are a headwind there, but we are comfortable that we should be a grower in absolute EBITDA and on a similar footing in terms of margins in 2024. Carlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. You may proceed. Steve Wieczynski : Yes. Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So Tom, look, I fully understand you guys don't give guidance for the full year, but given everything you've kind of talked about in your prepared remarks and kind of the first two questions here in the Q&A. I guess, the question is, is it possible to grow EBITDA this year in Vegas and the regionals segments? Tom Reeg : Yes, we expect to do both. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. That's very clear. Thank you for that. And then \u2013 so then second question, Tom, obviously, you guys continue to generate a good bit of free cash flow here. So just wondering if we can get your updated thoughts on deploying that free cash flow, given just now where the debt markets are versus where your current stock price is. Tom Reeg : We continue to want to use our free cash flow to reduce our debt as we get to the inflection point in our capital cycle. At that point, we'll look at where we are from a leverage standpoint, where the stock price is. I can tell you that if it has a forehandle, I would expect that we would be a buyer of our stock at that point. Steve Wieczynski : Okay. Very clear. Thank you very much, Tom. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to touch a bit more on regionals. It looked like over the course of the fourth quarter, trends kind of start to evolve and get a little bit better. And I recognize January, you touched on weather was certainly a headwind, but maybe kind of coming out of January, February today trends, can you give us a little bit more detail there. And maybe how that kind of jives with your expectation for EBITDA to be up year-over-year with regionals? Tom Reeg : Yes. I'd say, when you \u2013 in the brief periods, when you could get a clear look without weather impact, the regional business remains firm. We feel good about where we\u2019re headed. Obviously, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we only had about six months of Danville last year. We\u2019ll have a full year this year. You can see the revenue numbers that that property is doing. And if you look at kind of the, let\u2019s say, April to December period from last year, regional revenue was really nothing to write home about. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got a particularly difficult comp in regionals generally for the bulk of 2024 and we feel good about what we can deliver. Dan Politzer : Got it. Thanks. And then just switching to the free cash flow, you\u2019ve done this big refi, maybe maintenance CapEx and cash taxes have shifted around. But could you just kind of remind us of that bridge as you think about 2025 from EBITDA down to free cash flow? Tom Reeg : Yes. I mean, we\u2019re $4 billion now with digital doing de minimis EBITDA. By 2025 we\u2019d expect to be in the neighborhood of $0.5 billion of digital EBITDA. We expect some growth from brick and mortar. We\u2019ve got about $2 billion between interest expense and lease expense today that should be coming down both because of rate and because of reduction in leverage and maintenance capital is about $400 million a year. Dan Politzer : Any assumptions for cash taxes in there just along with that? And that\u2019s it for me. Bret Yunker : Yes, we\u2019ll start being a cash taxpayer in 2025. We don\u2019t have an estimate for you. It depends on all the assumptions you just use to get to free cash flow. But we\u2019ll start being a taxpayer next year. Dan Politzer : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. You may proceed. Brandt Montour : Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So, in Las Vegas, you gave the convention group mix, I think for either the fourth quarter or the full year. Where do you see that mix going this year? And maybe you could give us an update on sort of how attrition is going and how you\u2019re able \u2013 if you\u2019re getting any incremental benefits on your revenue management yield side from the increase in mix and convention. Bret Yunker : Brandt, as Anthony mentioned, you\u2019re right. Convention had a record in 2023. Occupied room nights were 17%. We continue to expect growth into 2024. We\u2019d expect the occupied room night mix to grow to the high teens over time. Forward pace looks encouraging for group in the convention business. And you\u2019re right, from a mix perspective, having that group and convention on the books is very helpful to the leisure side. So that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving the cash ADRs on the leisure side as well. Brandt Montour : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe a question to follow-up, maybe with Eric on the agreement with WynnBET. Could you just talk about the sort of pros and cons of coming out with a second brand? Obviously, it\u2019s additive to a certain extent. I\u2019m just curious how you weigh that against the scale of having a marketing budget, right, that can get maybe more bang for their buck if it\u2019s going toward one brand. But I guess maybe you\u2019re thinking about having two brands going for a different customer. So maybe you could just flesh that out for us. Eric Hession : Sure. We liken it a lot to the Las Vegas Strip where a customer that comes to town, they\u2019re going to stay at one property, but they\u2019re going to visit multiple properties just because they want a different feel, they want a different experience, maybe to change their luck or whatever the reason is. And we think that customers have that same behavior tendency online. We see that in New Jersey, where we run multiple brands today. And so a company like ours that has multiple well-known brands, we thought it\u2019s only logical to have a second offering for those customers. In terms of the brand building, it\u2019ll be a very well-known brand to everybody. So we\u2019re not going to spend a huge amount of money marketing the brand. What we\u2019ll spend money on is acquisition. And just like today, we\u2019ll do reasonable acquisition cost versus the lifetime value of the customer. And as a result, we feel like this is going to be a very incremental action for us to do. We don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be cannibalization between the two. And then in addition, because we\u2019ll be using the same platform and a lot of the same game content and integrations, the cost to launch a second brand will be much lower than it costs to have a single brand in the market. Brandt Montour : Very clear. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. You may proceed. David Katz : Hi. Afternoon. To use your adjective, Tom, chunky, any temptation or any thoughts about revisiting the notion of a Strip asset and lightning the portfolio to that end and put some takes there? Tom Reeg : Yes. David, as we've discussed, in terms of asset sales, everything's for sale every day in a public company, but we're not anticipating doing anything actively on our end. David Katz : Understood. And with respect to digital, if I can just follow-up on the sports betting side, since you are doing so nicely on iGaming, sports betting is a lot of talk about product advancement, same-game parlays, et cetera, and in play as a vehicle for growth. Could you just update us on your strategies there to sort of keep up with the leaders? Bret Yunker : Sure. This year, I would say that predominantly where we've invested has been on the feature side. So when we entered the year, there were a number of products that our customers wanted that we either didn't deliver very well or didn't deliver in the fullness, in terms of the breadth of markets that our competitors did. And so throughout the year, we invested heavily in getting those products up to where the market is. In doing so, the stability of the app, some of the bugginess, there are a few features that need to be enhanced, and so that's really where this year the predominant effort is going to be, on the sports betting side. So it's basically making the app very functional from the customer perspective. Given that, we feel like we closed a lot of the aspect and feature gap that was there in the year before. And so that's kind of what you'll see this year as we make the enhancements to the app throughout the year. David Katz : That'll work. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Barry Jonas with Truist. You may proceed. Barry Jonas : Hey, guys, can you talk a little bit more about New Orleans, maybe timing there and your ROI expectations? Also curious to hear about what you think the ramp is going to be with and without next year's Super Bowl. Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. Barry, as you know, that's a pretty dramatic transformation of that property. If you recall, when it was first opened, there were restrictions on what you could offer protections in place for both F&B and hotel in the city. So the current Hotel at Harrah's is across the street. You have to go either across the street or go below through a tunnel to get to the property. The food and beverage offerings were fairly pedestrian and a little bit limited. And so this transforms into Caesars New Orleans. There's a Caesars Hotel Tower that drops directly into the middle of the casino floor. The casino floor is entirely redone. As you \u2013 if you were to go there today, we've got about a third of the casino floor that's under construction at a time and it's rolling for the next six months or so. It's a stark difference in terms of what the new casino looks like versus the old. Basically an entirely new property. We've got restaurant product from Emeralds that's already open. Have we announced the others? Yes. So we've got Nobu coming. And keep in mind, Four Seasons has a brand-new property across the street. Windsor Court is across the street. Lowe's is across the street. So you've got a lot of the convention hotels in New Orleans are directly adjacent to our property and will feed into the venue and these F&B outlets. It should be a home run for us. So we're expecting that this property will be among our largest regional properties once we're complete. And that would be $200 million a year neighborhood of EBITDA. Barry Jonas : Great. And then just\u2026 Tom Reeg : Sorry to hit on Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is in New Orleans in next February, which is very well timed for us in terms of launching the product. New Orleans as a city has been slower to come back from a group standpoint than other convention cities. We would expect the Super Bowl will be a catalyst for that as well. Barry Jonas : Awesome. And just as a follow-up, obviously, New York's still ongoing, but I believe there are a number of regional land-based opportunities that have either come up more recently or being debated. Curious, if there's any new expansion opportunities that interest you at the moment? Tom Reeg : Nothing that's on the front burner. We're constantly approached with, would you do this? Would you do that? We're pretty focused on the projects that we have underway and are really looking forward to kind of a break in the capital intensity \u2013 CapEx cycle that we've seen since we closed the merger, and we're focusing on driving free cash flow for the next year or two. Barry Jonas : Great. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Stephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. When you think about the path to $500 million in EBITDA in Digital, which I realize you\u2019ve basically reiterated that I think each call this year. What has surprised you to the upside and or to the downside, as we think about market size, share, structural hold, marketing, et cetera from when you first put out that target? Tom Reeg : Yes. I would say the size of the market has consistently exceeded our expectations. Growth in mature markets that have had OSB for a while or iGaming continue to grow at steady clips. I would say legalization has been \u2013 there has been no real surprises there in terms of jurisdictions that did or didn\u2019t legalize our performance in iCasino since we launched Caesars Palace Online, we had pretty aggressive expectations and they\u2019ve exceeded those and it continues to accelerate. Obviously, I didn\u2019t foresee the Penn/ESPN transaction which allowed us to terminate an agreement that wasn\u2019t profitable for us. So those are kind of big picture what\u2019s changed since we first started this. Stephen Grambling : And where do you think structural hold should be in the online sports betting business as we think about longer term? Eric Hession : Yes. We\u2019ve said around 7.5% to 8% for us. We do have a lot of larger players that we know from the casino side that straight bets that kind of bring down that average. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our percentage of parlays and the percentage of legs per parlay do continue to be growing. We grew hold by about 100 basis points this year and it was fairly consistent throughout adjusting for kind of one off variances. Stephen Grambling : So just to be clear though, the 7.5% to 8% would be you have to get there through increased parlay mix from here that wouldn\u2019t be additive? Eric Hession : Yes. In order to get there, we\u2019re going to need to continue to increase our parlay mix or change the number of legs for people that are already betting existing parlays. Combination of those two should drive us up to that 7.5% to 8%. Stephen Grambling : Great, thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Julie Hoover with Bank of America. You may proceed. Shaun Kelley : Hi, everyone. It\u2019s Shaun Kelley on for Julie. Just two questions, if I could. First on the regional side, Tom, you\u2019ve been calling out for a while just some extra competition in a handful of markets. And as we screen the data that seems to be in markets that are particularly overlap with Caesars properties. So just kind of curious, has that settled down at all? Is that something that you kind of lap and expect to not deteriorate further? Just how do you underwrite that? Because it is a little different than the stability we\u2019ve seen, I think, more broadly across regional landscape. But again, we do see it in the numbers. Tom Reeg : Yes. The biggest impact that we saw last year was in Tunica, the property that opened closer to Memphis in Arkansas. We\u2019ve lapped that. So we don\u2019t expect to see continued \u2013 obviously you\u2019re continuing to compete with them, but we\u2019re fairly steady state now and can build back. Chicago had quite a few additions in the last 12 months. There\u2019s more to come. You got the Forge Creek [ph] property in the south suburbs, but we\u2019ve managed that pretty well in terms of exposure. You had the Spectacle property in Gary moving to the highway. We\u2019ve lapped that as well in Hammond that impacted Hammond. And then Nebraska we have the Lincoln properties online. The Omaha properties are expected to come online toward the end of this year. So there's still impact in the Council Bluffs market to come. But from, in terms of what we've been referencing, the bulk of that we've lapped at this point. Shaun Kelley : Great. Thank you very much. And then as my follow-up for you or for Eric, just how should we think about, let's call it EBITDA flow through as we think about sort of the change in revenue to the change in EBITDA moving forward in digital? I think traditionally when we talk to some of the other operators, we think anywhere in the range of 40% to 60% depending on the state, depending upon whether or not it's hold related or not. But there's still a decent amount of variable cost. The question is can that \u2013 is that the right formula for Caesars? Can it be any better than that as some of those marketing agreements roll-off and as \u2013 and as the flows are any different, especially in the iCasino side. Eric Hession : So good rule of thumb for us is 50% flow through as we sit here today, if iCasino continues to gain momentum you should expect to see that improve the runoff of the contracts will be helpful, but that's fairly lumpy. So I would expect we'd be at the midpoint of your number toward the higher end as some of these things happen. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question goes from John Decree with CBRE. You may proceed. John Decree : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to go back to the regional markets, Tom, I apologize if I missed, and I think you may have answered it with your growth commentary about the 1Q. But absent the weather or after the weather in January, what you've seen in February was a typical resume to normal. Is that fair? Tom Reeg : That's fair. John Decree : Thanks. And then I guess one other kind of housekeeping item and Vegas, the room disruptions that you cited in the 4Q, are they both complete and are there any kind of notable disruptions that we should think about in 2024 particularly in Las Vegas? I think you talked about some of the bigger ones in the regional market, so really just Las Vegas? Tom Reeg : No, those rooms are back online. We're building a bridge that connects that tower to the old Horseshoe to Paris, but that shouldn't have any disruption. John Decree : Right. Okay, that's it for me, just those housekeeping ones. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. You may proceed. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to the North Carolina launch, this one seems kind of as fair as it gets. You have a database with the Cherokee property and it sounds like Eric, all the features are pretty much almost there. So how should we think know what an expectation should be for you guys, whether it's market share or profitability or customer acquisition, should this look different in terms of share versus other states? Thanks. Tom Reeg : No, is the short answer. I'd look at what Michigan just reported. I think our peers were 3 to 4x our promo to handle. I'd expect that to look similar in North Carolina. Chad Beynon : Thank you, Tom. And then a follow-up to the last question, just in terms of the Vegas portfolio. So following the Versailles Tower and some of these F&B refreshers that you're doing, I know there's nothing else near-term, but how are you thinking about other, maybe transformative or kind of larger projects in Vegas? And how does the outcome of the Oakland A's [ph] situation change, what you're thinking from a timing standpoint? Thanks. Tom Reeg : I would for the second question the outcome of the Oakland A's [ph] situation doesn't impact what we'll be pursuing at all. What we're doing this year in addition to finishing the Versailles connector, is work at Flamingo in terms of improving the strip frontage. There's a number of outlets that are subpar and substandard in terms of what they generate relative to other similarly positioned spaces on the Strip. These are not huge dollar numbers, but they should help transform that property. Should be very high ROI, but you should be thinking about in Vegas, capital projects are $10 million $20 million, $25 million for a couple of things that we're doing in a building, not $100 million like Versailles. Chad Beynon : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. You may proceed. Daniel Guglielmo : Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just around labor at the properties. You guys have a good advantage of kind of the U.S. with the portfolio makeup has turnover. From a labor perspective, has it been similar this year to last year? Is there anything you're seeing within the different regions that would be helpful? Tom Reeg : Yes, I would say nothing particularly informative. The period post reopening after COVID was about as chaotic from an employment turnover standpoint as we've seen. That stabilized kind of in 2023, and it's been stable for a little while now. So it feels more like pre-pandemic in that area than it had immediately post opening. Daniel Guglielmo : Okay, great. Thank you. And then we've talked a lot about the capital flexibility in 2025 and just thinking about the VICI option for the Centaur [ph] properties outside of the share repurchases. And then I think you had said debt focus. Is there anything else you're kind of gearing up forward looking at when thinking out two years? Tom Reeg : No. Obviously, VICI has that option that expires at the end of 2024. They've indicated an intention to exercise it, and there's regulatory process that they need to go through. And \u2013 you should not expect us to exercise our option, but we do anticipate that they'd like to exercise theirs. Daniel Guglielmo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. You may proceed. Jordan Bender : Great. Thanks for taking my question. With the new app, you mentioned a shift into more slot play and not that hold shouldn\u2019t move much for iGaming. But is there any upside to iGaming hold as you shift away from some of the lower margin table play? Tom Reeg : Yes, that's been a big lift for us in iGaming. That table dominant player that we had is typically 100 to 150 basis points lower in hold than the slot dominant player that we find in Caesars Palace Online. So that's helped us in our momentum as well. Jordan Bender : Okay, and then just to follow-up, I assume you pick up the Wynn database in the state as well. How should we just think about that customer mix versus what you currently have in that state? Thank you. Bret Yunker : Yes, we do pick up the database, and we'll work closely with Wynn as we transition to move the customers over, so that they can trial our app. The database is different from ours, but in terms of the customers, but it's very similar in terms of what we're trying to accomplish with the apps that we're launching. So it's a slot \u2013centric customer at a slightly higher end, and then from a table perspective, it's also on a slightly higher end from what we normally have in our database. So we're excited to introduce those customers to the product that we have. Jordan Bender : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Reeg for any closing remarks. Tom Reeg : Thanks, everybody for your time, and we'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brian Agnew : Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our first quarter 2024 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the period ended March 31, 2024. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. As usual, joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our CEO; Anthony Carano, our President and COO; Bret Yunker, our CFO; Eric Hession, President, Caesars Sports & Online Gaming; and my colleague, Charise Crumbley, Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and these statements may or may not come true. Also, during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. Please visit our press releases located under our Investor Relations website for a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure. I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. During the first quarter, consolidated net revenues of $2.7 billion declined 1% and total adjusted [ EBITDA ] of $853 million declined 10% year-over-year. We faced several transitory issues during the quarter, including low table hold in our Las Vegas segment and inclement winter weather in our regional segment, plus a loss on the launch of Sports Betting in North Carolina. Despite these transitory issues, there were several bright spots during the quarter, including record Q1 occupancy in Las Vegas, driven by strong visitation, 23% OSB net gaming revenue growth and 54% iCasino net gaming revenue growth in our Digital segment and sequential improvement in operating results in our Regional segment each month during Q1. Despite the hold related headwinds in Las Vegas during the quarter, our Las Vegas segment delivered $440 million of adjusted [ EBITDA, ] which is the second best Q1 on record. Occupancy in Q1 reached 97.6%, a new Q1 record, which also drove a record for Q1 cash hotel and food and beverage revenues during the quarter. In our Regional segment in Q1, we delivered $433 million of adjusted [ EBITDA ] down 3% versus last year, driven by unfavorable winter weather during the first 6 weeks of the quarter. Regional trends improved each month throughout the quarter with March delivering positive revenue and [ EBITDA ] growth. Similar to prior quarters, outside of the negative weather impacts, we continue to face new competition in a few markets and construction disruption in New Orleans, which was partially offset by our new temporary facilities in Danville, Virginia and Columbus, Nebraska. Turning to CapEx. In 2024, we will finish several construction projects that we expect to generate strong returns and will complete an elevated CapEx cycle for the company. The permanent facility in Columbus, Nebraska will open on May 13. Construction in New Orleans should finish by Labor Day and the permanent facility in Danville is expected to open by year-end. All 3 of these projects will deliver strong returns on capital to drive growth in Regional segment. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work so far in 2024. Our strong results are a reflection of their dedication to delivering exceptional guest service. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric Hession for some insights on the first quarter performance in our Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. Caesars Digital delivered $282 million in net revenues, up 19% year-over-year and generated $5 million of adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Results in our Digital segment were driven by strong momentum in both online Sports Betting and iCasino during the quarter. As Anthony mentioned, Online Sports Betting net revenues grew 23% and iCasino delivered 54% net revenue growth. The strong performance in these 2 verticals was offset slightly by declines in our Retail and Other segments. In our Online Sports Betting segment during the quarter, hold increased roughly 80 basis points year-over-year. However, despite the increase, it was at the lower end of our expected range due to less favorable results around Super Bowl and March Madness. Despite the unfavorable large event outcomes, Parlay mix improved approximately 400 basis points year-over-year during the quarter, driven by our improved user interface and pricing uptime. Higher parlay mix gives us confidence in our ability to continue to improve holds throughout 2024 and beyond. iGaming set new quarterly records for active customers, volume, GGR and net gaming revenue driven by the success of our New Caesars Palace Online App, which despite only launching roughly 7 months ago, now makes up more than 50% of the net gaming revenues in this segment. Customers continue to respond favorably to the product interface, game content and improved loyalty marketing. iCasino remains a critical component of our Digital growth strategy for 2024 and beyond. During the quarter, we also successfully launched Mobile Sports Wagering in North Carolina. We're encouraged by the early results and have signed up new customers at a faster pace than prior state launches, translating into a higher initial market share. We remain focused on several key priorities for the remainder of the year. On the Sports Betting side, work continues on our proprietary TAM, which will enable shared wallet across state lines. We expect to deliver this important functionality across all the jurisdictions in which we operate by the middle of 2025. We will also continue to improve our product on the Sports Betting side, enhancing our same-game parlay, live wagering and internal pricing. On the iCasino side, we will continue to add additional game content and functionality and are on track to launch our new iCasino brand in the second half of 2024. We now offer Sports Betting in 31 North America jurisdictions, 26 of which offer mobile wagering. I'm very pleased with the project -- progress we made this first quarter. Excluding the effects from new state launches, our net revenue flow-through to EBITDA was over 50%, consistent with our expectations and setting the stage for continued profitable growth in the years ahead. Now I'll turn it over to Bret. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. We had an active first quarter on the capital markets side, refinancing $4.4 billion of parent-level debt, eliminating the CRC credit entity and extending debt maturities to 2031 and beyond. On April 26, we closed on a new $425 million bank financing at the joint venture level for our Danville property. This facility will be used to cover all remaining CapEx requirements for the permanent casino that is expected to open in December. 2024 CapEx, excluding our Danville JV is expected to be $800 million. We look forward to using strong free cash flow generation to continue to repay debt and reduce leverage towards our stated goals. Over to Tom. Thomas Reeg : Thanks, Bret. We're not in the habit of delivering quarters that look like this. So I want to go through detail on how we got there and want to talk about whether anything fundamental has changed in the business. This is the kind of --  kind of answer the questions I would have if I was in your seat. If you look at the biggest buckets that this was kind of a kitchen sink type quarter for us, everything that could go wrong did for us. The biggest pieces are hold in Las Vegas, weather across the country that was well understood and you've seen with others and then losses around the launch of North Carolina in Digital. There's others that I'll touch on that are more minor, but there's well over $75 million of what's clearly onetime negatives for us in the quarter. So if I look at kind of the -- where we came out of the quarter and the way the business was operating fundamentally during the quarter, it looks more in my estimation, like a flattish quarter, notwithstanding the EBITDA that we posted. Starting in Vegas, our typical hold is a range of 20% to 23% tables in Vegas. We were 15% for the quarter. So 500 to 800 basis points below normal range. Midpoint of that is 650, and that's on $850 million of drop. So you can see that's in a very, very large piece of the shortfall in the quarter. This is -- table hold is a typical bell curve, we were certainly in the second standard deviation to the negative. We are completely comfortable that this reverses over time. You'll have quarters that were -- are the reverse. I'm sure you -- as you're listening, you can think of some -- in recent history that were 2 standard deviations to the positive, unfortunately not for us, but our time will come. This was not an instance of a few players beating us. This was kind of a repeated b kicking broadly based throughout the quarter. If you look at our volumes, slots were about flat. As Anthony said, Hotel and F&B hit set first quarter records and both Hotel and F&B overcame -- the revenue overcame the increases in union costs to deliver more profitability to us. So volumes were great. People are still here. We just didn't hold. And if you think about running these properties at over 97% occupancy, you're fully staffed. There is no opportunity to make uphold. So it's particularly negative on the operating leverage side when you don't hold. We have the additional impact of Adele in Colosseum, shifted dates from March into the fourth quarter that impacts this quarter, but that's revenue and EBITDA that we will pick up in the fourth quarter with the rescheduled dates, so largely a nonevent other than in this quarter's numbers. If we look at forward, as we sit here today, I'm looking at April, May, June, each month is forecast at 98% occupancy in the market. Our cash rates are depending on the month, up 8% to 14%. So Vegas remains very, very strong. I'm not a guy who likes to talk about hold. So I'm hoping this is the last time I talk about it this year. But if you presume normal hold and what we see in front of us on a forward basis, I would expect Vegas to grow for each of the last 3 quarters of the year. We're in about a $70 million -- a little over $70 million hold out of the first quarter. I don't know that we'll make up that entire $70 million that probably needs hold benefit on the right side of the range, but I'd expect we're eating at that throughout each quarter the rest of the year. Moving to Regionals. We were down 3%. As I said, weather was a significant impact that everybody knows about. Absent weather, Regionals would have been up year-over-year for us. We are particularly optimistic about the rest of the year, particularly the second half, continue to believe that Regionals will grow on a full year basis for us. Anthony talked about New Orleans and Danville coming online to give you an addition to Columbus, Nebraska, which will start cash flowing in the next couple of weeks. So that's dollars we've spent that has no EBITDA attached to it until it opens 2 weeks from now. But if you start in Danville, that's a property that's operating in a temporary structure at the highest win per unit numbers in our entire system, which reflects unmet demand. We almost double our capacity when we opened the permanent facility at the end of the year. That's -- that will be dilutive to margins because the permanent facilities -- I'm sorry, the temporary facility is operating excess of 60% margins, but it's accretive to overall EBITDA. And then if you think about New Orleans, as that opens Labor Day and you think about returns, recall that the way New Orleans runs its gaming tax regime in the City of New Orleans. There's a flat tax until you reach a certain level of gaming revenue. As we sit here today on an LTM basis, we're about $75 million below where that property moves to a variable rate versus a flat tax. So if you think about it in terms of returns on the project, the first $75 million of incremental gaming revenue generated has no incremental gaming tax to us. So obviously, as extraordinarily high flow-through. So that's Regionals in Vegas. One more thing on Regionals. If you think about trajectory, Regional EBITDA in January for us was down more than 20%, in February it was down about 4% and in March was up about 10%. And if you look at this quarter, it's hard to talk much about April in terms of predictive effect since Aprils' the least important month of the second quarter, but what we feel good about the quarter and the rest of the year. Digitals, an exciting story for us -- I may be repeating some of Eric's numbers, but if you look at Digital, North Carolina for us was a much more successful launch in terms of customer acquisition than we were anticipating. And then what we have seen in recent states, we didn't make any change to how we promoted into it. It's really a comment on the strength of our database in North Carolina. But our first month market share was almost 9% of the market, which is about 3x what we've been doing in other new launch states. So as a result, North Carolina was negative [ 11 ] of net revenue in the quarter and negative $20 million of EBITDA. So if you strip out that launch, we were $25 million of EBITDA. OSB revenue was up 33% and iCasino, as Eric said, which was not impacted by North Carolina was up 54%. So tremendous momentum in Digital for us in the quarter, and that was despite, as others have talked about. March Madness, Super Bowl were not great from a whole perspective, our hold was up. Our Parlay percentage was up over 20% versus the same quarter last year. So our efforts to increase our hold our bearing fruit. As you can see, we are almost 100 basis points better in the queue despite poor sports outcomes. On the Caesars Palaces' online launch, as Eric said, we're now in our 7th month post launch, and that business is already doing more than 50% of our revenue. In iCasino, it's doing exactly what we anticipated in terms of creating an iGaming customer base that looks like our database, looks like our physical floors, SKUs females, SKUs to slots, you should expect us to continue to build on that momentum. We'd anticipate launching a second brand very similar to the first before the end of the year that should allow us to continue that momentum. There's been a lot of talk for a lot of quarters about, \" Gee, can you get to $500 million\"? I've talked about the legs of the stool that get us there. If we look at it in a different way, in terms of what I see as I look at how we build this business, we did $1 billion of net revenue in Digital in 2023. We reported $40 million of EBITDA on a hold-adjusted basis, fourth quarter, that'd be [ $60 million, ] whether you use [ $40 million or $60 million ] start there. The industry growing at 30% this year. We're growing -- we should be growing at least at that given our iGaming is growing considerably faster than the market. As Eric said, our flow-through was in excess of 50% in this quarter. So if you take the $1 billion, you have us grow at the market level and you flow that through. It's very easy for you to do that math. If you do that again, in 2025, that should get you to something like $1.7 billion of revenue and something over $400 million in EBITDA. That does not include any benefit from the partnerships that roll off in the '24, '25 time frame. That's how I get to the $500 million target in '25 that very few of you believe that I see as really simple math and continuation of what's already happening in this business. If you want to quibble with me whether $500 million is a full year '25 number or we're run rating at that level in '25 and don't quite get to $500 million? I'm happy to have that discussion. I'd say that's certainly up for debate. But the idea that we're not going to do $500 million to me looks highly unlikely. And as I look at that target now, I look at that as a point in time, and we're going to continue to move past that. We are going to generate more than $500 million of Digital EBITDA. It's just a matter of when we're going to generate that. So we feel very, very, very good about what's going on in Digital and that it really matches the progress against markers that we laid out when there was no one in the space laying out any similar markers before we launched in August of '21. We laid out how much we spend, what we thought the return could be and we are right on that pace, if not ahead at this point. So feel fantastic about where digital is today. In terms of capital, we're spending a lot of capital this year. I've talked about on prior calls, we walked into a lot of capital spend when we did the Caesars merger. Caesars had already agreed to make the New Orleans investment that finishes Labor Day. They had already won the license in Danville. The permit, it opens at the end of the year. And New Jersey gently encouraged us to spend the $400 million in CapEx in New Jersey. That's in the rearview mirror at this point. So as we report this quarter, we are 1 quarter closer to the step-down in CapEx spend and the increase in free cash flow that I've talked about as our opportunity to move to offense, whether offense is buying in stock that in my estimation seems attractive or if we're in a different ZIP code potentially looking outside for growth opportunities. You're really -- as we sit here at the end of April, you're about 5 months away from that. So we -- you should expect a step down in gross CapEx in '25, that's in excess of $500 million. Bret told you we just closed on our Danville credit facility, so the funding from Danville doesn't come through our balance sheet this year. So we really feel good about where we're sitting, what the rest of the year looks like. But as I said, we're not in the habit of reporting quarters like this. I wanted to give everyone a sense of where I see the business and where I see what this quarter looked like. You'll all do with that what you will. But we anticipate getting back to quarters like we've been printing for the last 10 years, starting with the next one. And with that, I'll open it up to questions. *Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Tom, thank you for your remarks. I'm not going to get into the whole stuff. There was some stuff in there that I didn't entirely follow, but we can review it off-line. What I wanted to ask about though was kind of the -- what I see is kind of the widening gap between an implied Las Vegas GGR, and net casino revenue. And I want to understand maybe a little bit, is that a change in promotions? Does it have to do with the occupancies going up, maybe more comped rooms? And then as you mentioned, cash rates were up nicely on the coming months. But what percentage of the mix to the extent you could share? Should we think about as being cash rates going forward? Thomas Reeg : Cash rates for us versus comp rates? Say it again. Carlo Santarelli : Yes. Thomas Reeg : We're about 75% cash in Vegas, and that hasn't really changed. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. And then on the other point, just in terms of reinvestment, et cetera, acknowledging -- look, we don't have your slot hold, but if I were to just make assumptions that it's somewhat static, that gap seems to widen a little bit. And I was just wondering, is that some influence from the whole dynamics on the table side? Or is there -- has there been a little bit of a change in promotional strategy? Thomas Reeg : We have made 0 changes in promotional strategy. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Some of it perhaps -- Rio coming out. I imagine probably has some modest influence as well? Thomas Reeg : Correct. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff from JPM. Joseph Greff : Sticking with Las Vegas here, the Q has -- your table game drop was down 10% year-over-year. And slot handle down about 7% year-over-year. Last year's numbers include the Rio. What are those numbers, excluding the Rio? I'm presuming, I mean there wasn't that much net revenue from Rio last year. It was like $55 million in the first quarter. What's driving those declines excluding the Rio? Thomas Reeg : Slot handle was down 2%, Joe, net of the Rio and table drop was down 7%. So net revenue was down 4.5%. The bulk of everything that flowed through the quarter was table hold related. And recall, last year's first quarter was ginormous. Joseph Greff : Okay. Great. And then you mentioned CapEx coming down. Obviously, the numbers you're talking about from an operating perspective would suggest attractive free cash flow generation the last 3 quarters of this year and through next year and earmarked presumably for debt pay down. Outside of deploying excess free cash flow to debt paydown and EBITDA moving in the right direction to reduce your net leverage ratios. Can you talk about other potential avenues for you to reduce leverage? Thomas Reeg : Yes. Sure, Joe. We have a number of assets that produce very little or no cash flow that are noncore to the business, non-operating casinos that could potentially be monetized at attractive rates where you wouldn't have to change your model much. And without getting too forward-looking, you shouldn't be surprised if some of those types of things start to happen in 2024 that our leverage reduction is not limited to only free cash flow. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt Montour : Maybe over on Regionals looking at the margin performance that you guys reported in the 1Q. When I look at OpEx and imply it back on OpEx, it looks like OpEx actually was pretty similar to -- of 1Q '23 despite opening in two properties. I'm curious if there were onetime savings in there from the January weather or anything else that we can kind of think about to try and think about your operating OpEx per day going forward? Thomas Reeg : I'm sorry, can you repeat that, Brandt? Brandt Montour : Sure. So your OpEx was flat in regionals year-over-year, right? Ex gaming taxes. Thomas Reeg : Correct. Brandt Montour : And so we were just trying to figure out how you're able to keep costs so low given you opened 2 properties since last year? And if maybe there were some savings in January from the poor weather or if there was anything else onetime? Thomas Reeg : There was no -- there were no positives coming out of the weather. So there were no savings there. I mean you've known us long enough that we're constantly looking at how can we improve our margins. We're trying to not just be a cork in the ocean in terms of just being washed with where the economy goes. So we're always looking for efficiencies, and that's a testament to our team who has been together a very long time knowing we're in an environment that's generally inflationary, we're in both Vegas and Atlantic City, where our biggest union exposure is dealing with increased costs, and we don't tend to just eat that. We intend to improve the business from an operating perspective, become more efficient and deliver growth. And that's our expectation as we move forward. Brandt Montour : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on Digital. You gave -- Tom, you gave Digital ex North Carolina. I was just curious if you could give us or Eric, if you could give us the theoretical hold with the new -- with the Bumped up Parlay mix ex sport outcomes in March, so we can kind of think about the new normal here going forward? Eric Hession : Yes. We haven't disclosed our current structural hold, but we've set the target at 8.5%, and we're well on the way there. Tom had referenced the increase in the Parlays. But on top of that, we also have increased of the people making Parlays. They're making more legs, which has a compounding effect. And so we're very pleased with the progress we're making. And as we mentioned, absent those 2 large event outcomes, we would have seen even a larger increase year-over-year than what we did. What we were able to achieve. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski from Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : So Tom, can you help me with some of the numbers that you listed out in your prepared remarks. I got somewhat confused. So -- and that's not difficult to do. But I thought you said $75 million kind of total in terms of weather-hold losses around North Carolina. But then I thought I heard you say Vegas was kind of tied to a $70 million hold the rest of the year. So just trying to reconcile what that -- make sure I have that $75 million total impact, right? And then maybe how that broke down a little more between Vegas-Regionals-Digital? Thomas Reeg : Yes. I told you the big ones. The three big ones. Hold Weather and North Carolina launch were more than $75 million. I mentioned other things like Adele moving that are smaller stuff that gets us to, if I'm looking at true non-onetime performance. I'm getting back to pretty close to even versus last year, which would include an increase in Digital if you're losing the $20 million North Carolina loss, an increase in Regional. But Vegas is probably still a little short to the record first quarter last year. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. That's perfect. That makes sense. And then Tom, you indicated you guys will start to go on the offensive as or on offense as your CapEx is reduced. And you mentioned that, that means you could look at external growth opportunities. So I guess the simple question is what do you consider a growth opportunity these days? Thomas Reeg : I think the most attractive opportunity I have for free cash flow, if I'm living in the current neighborhood is my own stock. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel Politzer : I wanted to touch on Las Vegas a little bit on the non-gaming side. I know you mentioned that occupancy was up a couple of hundred basis points year-over-year. But if we look at even the nongaming revenues, even adjusting for Rio, it seems like it's lagging the market I mean, can you maybe zoom in a little bit there and give us color? Is it low end versus high end? I know there was disruptions during the quarter, but is there anything else, I guess, under the surface that we should just kind of be aware of? Thomas Reeg : I don't have anybody else's numbers yet in terms of the quarter. Our hotel revenues are up. Our food and beverage revenue was up about 14%. I'll be surprised if that's lagging the market. Daniel Politzer : That's ex Rio, I assume? Thomas Reeg : Correct. Daniel Politzer : Okay. And then I guess for my follow-up, on the noncash flow producing assets you mentioned, I mean you've kind of pivoted to more of a floating rate structure on your capital in terms of your balance sheet. How do you think about where interest rates are and some of those assets? I mean, is Centaur coming back into the mix as a potential option? Or when you talk about those noncash flow producing assets, is it completely -- is that in Regional, strip real estate? Any incremental detail or clues would be helpful. Thomas Reeg : I'm not going to help you on the clues. I'll tell you, Centaur is -- would certainly not be described as a nonoperating casino generating cash flow. So that's not part of it. But there's a lot of assets in this company that don't make it into your sum of the parts that have real value that we can realize and you shouldn't be surprised if we start to put some of them on the board in '24. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas from Truist Securities. Barry Jonas : I want to dig a little more into what you're seeing with the consumer and the Regionals in Vegas. And maybe just touch on visitation as opposed to spend per visit trends? Thomas Reeg : Yes. Look, I've tried to make clear all of our volume indicators were healthy in the quarter. Vegas number -- obviously, we lost CON/AGG, we picked up Super Bowl. So you had a big group that didn't show up in a big group that wasn't part of last year. But you can see it in our hotel occupancy, our hotel revenue, our food and beverage, all of those numbers remain healthy. The fact that regional ex January would have grown year-over-year should tell you that the consumer on -- that we see on balance continues to remain healthy and spending is robust. Barry Jonas : Got it. Got it. And then just curious, what are your expectations today around VICI exercising its call option for Centaur? Thomas Reeg : I mean you guys are closer to accretion dilution math for them. I suspect that's what ultimately makes the decision. We are operating under the assumption that they intend to exercise, which is what they've told us in the past, but they've also said they won't do a dilutive deal. And as I understand, it's pretty close as it sits here today. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. David Katz : Appreciate all the detail. I just wanted to drill down a little further on the Digital discussion. If I sort of start off with notionally $50 million and I worked through the math, as I think you've laid it out, what it appears to imply is that the business grows to something just under $400 million of EBITDA? And is the inference that those deals that are rolling off are that significant that there are that they're in the 9-figure neighborhood in terms of the cost that goes away? Or is -- if you can sort of help me sort of dial in my mistake if I've made one? Thomas Reeg : The partnership roll-off is significant and material. I'm giving you -- we grow like the market grows. We're growing in excess of that. And that's where I said we can argue about is $500 million the full year of '25? Or are we just short of it and we surpassed it early in '26? I would say the jury is out there. The argument that we're not going to get to $500 million. The math does not support that at this point. David Katz : Understood. So there may be just a little bit more growth in the market in there and the timing of how that rolls in and the partnerships, et cetera. But the partnerships are pretty material? Thomas Reeg : Yes, they are chunky and kind of roll off in that -- the bulk of them in that '25 time frame. But also note, again, whether that's a full year of '25 or its beginning of '26, it's a point in time, and we're going to continue growing beyond that. David Katz : Understood. $100 million is -- when a $100 million is chunky, that's pretty good. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : You mentioned a few times that looking across, whether it's the regions or Vegas, your expectations ex one-timers are effectively consistent. But what KPIs are you watching to assess whether it makes sense to perhaps start playing defense as it relates to costs? And as a related follow-up, what are the biggest levers if things were to erode and how should investors generally think about operating leverage as it seems like the market is back to worrying a little bit about the consumer here, and you've been able to be nimble in the past? Thomas Reeg : Yes, Stephen, I'd say we're always on defense on costs. And we are -- you should presume in a quarter like this, after the run that these businesses have had that we would be going to our local leaders and saying show me how we can tighten further, either by generating more revenue or more or fewer costs so that it's EBITDA additive. I'm not in the habit of coming up with a pithy name for that type of program. And laying out what those targets would be. But you should expect that we have initiatives in place that are well into 9 figures that we would anticipate flowing through the business by the end of this year. And that's partly just that's what we do, but it's also -- we recognized that growth is going to be not as easy to come by in the brick-and-mortar as it's been coming out of COVID. And we intend to continue to grow. So you should expect that's ongoing. I don't have a good acronym for it, but expect that you're going to see that flowing through in the coming quarters. Stephen Grambling : Got it. And maybe just not put words in your mouth, but to make sure this is clear. I guess, if things were to erode, you're already taking action so you would help mitigate any kind of operating deleverage? But on the flip side, if things reaccelerate, we could actually anticipate greater flow-through? Thomas Reeg : Correct. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : I wanted to just dig in on -- or go back to digital for a second. Some of the numbers given in the prepared remarks on both OSB growth and iGaming are obviously super compelling. They don't totally tie out some of the disclosures in the 10-Q. I think some of this has to do with what you're seeing in maybe the brick-and-mortar side of the Sports book business or maybe the way that some of that played through with Super Bowl. Could you help us square some of those because, again, like I think some of the sports betting numbers, in particular, that were quoted -- on the OSB side, we're up very, very strongly. But we see in the disclosure, at least actual volumes were on Sports Betting handle were slightly down. So could you help us with that a little bit? Thomas Reeg : So you've got North Carolina is a piece of it. But yes, Retail Sports was negative from a hold perspective in the quarter. And that hit revenue and flows through, that's where you're most acute flow-through of both Super Bowl and March Madness hints. Shaun Kelley : And Tom, just to clarify that Retail Sports Book hold was actually negative for the entire quarter? Was there the outlook for that... Thomas Reeg : No, it was down materially from last year's first quarter. Shaun Kelley : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then look, I know this one may be a little bit of the dead horse. But just to go back to the Las Vegas volumes. I mean, I think the bottom line here, Tom, is when you see the numbers that you see and you strip out or adjust for the Rio, it really sounds like you don't believe there's much of a volume or a consumer challenge or change here at the margin. And I just kind of wanted to A, double check that and B, just get your thoughts on kind of broader market share because it does feel like what we see just mostly through industry statistics, is share gains particularly consolidating it like the top end or some of the luxury and more Baccarat focused properties on the market. How are you kind of adjusting or moving around the portfolio to compete or to hold share in this environment today? Thomas Reeg : Yes, Look, I'm looking at EBITDA. I'm not looking at GGR share. That's what you move with promo. Our international business was as high as it's been since going back to '19 in the quarter, our high -- our VVIP volumes were quite strong, we didn't hold. If you look at -- is it March has been reported already? Somebody is going to tell you they held because it wasn't us. And Baccarat held in the quarter or in the month. So we're really not seeing much in the way of share shifts that we need to respond to. If you look at the quarter, I would say January didn't feel great on a year-over-year basis. February and March did feel great, and the net result was volumes ended up about the same for the quarter against the biggest first quarter we've ever had. So I suspect when you hear others you might hear January didn't start that great, but that was very short-lived and February and March up much better. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John DeCree from CBRE. John DeCree : Maybe two. The first one back on Las Vegas. I'm not sure if I missed in the prepared remarks, if we already touched on it, I apologize. But I know Tom -- gave some color on 2Q, but curious if you guys have any stats in front of you about the balance of the year beyond that, perhaps where you have some visibility in Vegas like group bookings or mix group pacing or rate pacing? Just give us a sense of what the back half might look like? Brian Agnew : John, same comments on group and convention as we talked about on the last call. For the year, we would expect group and convention to be up in '24 versus '23. That segment set records in 2022 and 2023. In the first quarter, we were down a little bit as a percentage of occupied room nights. We were at 19% this year versus 21% last due to CON/AGG. But the pace for the remaining quarters 2Q, 3Q and 4Q looks very good. John DeCree : Great. Thanks Brian. And Tom, maybe one for you on external use of capital. I think your response to a prior question is pretty clear about where you see the stock. But given the kind of explosive growth we've seen in costs across the industry in the U.S. and your team's track record of operating efficiency, does domestic M&A as a way of perhaps finding more EBITDA growth than your peers? Or is there opportunities in the domestic market that might look interesting given your kind of abilities and your team's abilities relative to the cost growth that we've seen? Thomas Reeg : Short answer, John, is yes, we think there are but those that are of -- those that make a difference in terms of talking about in terms of scale would require equity as a piece of a transaction and in the current neighborhood, I'm certainly not a seller of my equity for any reason. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad Beynon : On the Digital side, can you just remind us or kind of help us think about what's additive versus cannibalization after you launched your casino brand? And could this just be kind of a step forward for another thing? How many brands do you think makes the most sense in your consumer data? Thomas Reeg : Well, ultimately, you're limited by how many skins that you have. So you saw the transaction that we did with Wynn in Michigan that allows us hopefully, before too long to have another skin in that state. So we have two available in each iCasino jurisdiction and that should allow us to launch a second brand, and then we'll -- obviously, we'll see what happens after that and where we can get to from a skin perspective, it's different by state, but we have enough at this point to launch in every iCasino state. Chad Beynon : And then coming back to margins. I know before you've said in some of the markets you need to grow revs, I believe, 5% to hold margins. Does that broad statement hold true? Or could you grow slightly lower than that and still keep margins flat on a year-over-year basis? Thomas Reeg : Yes, I'd say yes to slightly lower, but I'd use 5% as a target. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Guglielmo from Capital One Securities. Daniel Guglielmo : The Harrah's in Pompano has continued to perform well after the expansion and rebrand outside of the current pipeline. Do you all have any similar near-term projects for properties that may be dealing with some of the competitive pressures that were mentioned in the opening remarks? Thomas Reeg : So the only place we have a similar undeveloped real estate piece is Scioto Downs in Columbus, which could be a longer-term opportunity, but that Pompano development has been, what, 5 plus years in the making at this point. Slow developing, but it's gratifying to see what it's doing for both revenue and EBITDA at that property. Daniel Guglielmo : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just around expenses. So the negotiations and the expense accruals have been pushed through and the contracts give some predictability for the next few years? But are there any surprises or dynamics you all are thinking through on the expense side this year into 2025? Thomas Reeg : No, not really, other than what I've discussed in terms of opportunities on both revenues and expenses that we are targeting based on the list we put together at the beginning of the year. There's nothing. It's a lot of small stuff that adds up to a big number that we need to go block and tackle, and that's what we intend to do. Operator : And due to time constraints, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Tom Reeg for any further remarks. Thomas Reeg : Thanks, everybody. We'll talk to you next time. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Agnew, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Treasury, and Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Brian Agnew : Thank you, Tawanda, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our second quarter 2024 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the period ended June 30, 2024. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. As usual, joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our Chief Executive Officer; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bret Yunker, our Chief Financial Officer; Eric Hession, President Caesars Sports and Online Gaming, and Charise Crumbley in Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and these statements may or may not come true. Also, during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. Please visit our press releases located on our Investor Relations website for a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure. With that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our second quarter delivered consolidated net revenues of $2.8 billion and total adjusted EBITDAR of $1 billion, both flat versus prior year. Our Las Vegas segment delivered a same-store second quarter net revenue record of $1.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDAR of $514 million beat the prior year by 1.2%. These results were driven by continued growth in hotel cash revenue as a result of higher year-over-year occupancy and ADRs and record performance from our food and beverage. Recent room renovations at our newly rebranded Versailles Tower at Paris and Colosseum Tower at Caesars Palace are driving above-plan returns on investment driven by strong gains in cash ADRs. The group and convention segment also delivered an increase in occupied room night makes year-over-year and recent forward pace for 2025 has strengthened. Las Vegas EBITDAR margins of 46.6% were down only 40 basis points year-over-year despite increases in labor. We remain encouraged for operating trends in Las Vegas segment based on our forward expectations for continued strong occupancy and hotel pricing trends coupled with the decrease in room inventory on the Las Vegas Strip. In our regional segment, adjusted EBITDAR for the quarter was $469 million, down 8% year-over-year. Results were driven by a combination of competitive pressures in certain markets, construction disruption, principally in New Orleans, and a difficult comparison in Reno due to a large group event last year, offset by performance from our Danville and Nebraska properties. Despite revenue declines, EBITDA margins in our regional segment were down only 100 basis points, reflecting strong cost discipline. During the quarter, we celebrated the opening of Paris, Nebraska's permanent facility on May 17th, the company's first property in the state, which is off to a strong start. We look forward to the completion of our newly rebranded Caesars property in New Orleans in October and the opening of the Danville permanent facility in December. Our elevated capital investment cycle is coming to an end which will drive strong returns for the regional segment looking ahead. Our team members continue to deliver exceptional guest experiences as a result of their continued hard work and dedication. I want to thank all of our team members for their contributions to our strong results, which are a product of their commitment to excellence. With that I will now turn the call over to Eric for some detail on the second quarter results in our Caesars Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony Caesars Digital delivered second quarter net revenues of $276 million up 28% year-over-year and set a quarterly adjusted EBITDA record of $40 million versus $11 million in the year ago period. Including this quarter, we have now generated trailing 12 months EBITDA of $76 million. Our net revenue flow through EBITDA in the quarter remained within our 50% range. Net revenues in our sports betting segment increased 19% year-over-year, driven by flat handle and hold of 7.2% which improved 80 basis points versus last year. Our product on the sports side continues to improve and our customers are reacting positively to our increasing mix of parlay and in-game offerings. We continue to drive growth in our parlay wagers with the percentage of that type of wager growing 380 basis points year-over-year, consistent with the trends we've observed throughout the year. In July, we closed on the acquisition of ZeroFlucs a leading sports betting technology company based in Australia. ZeroFlucs team has already started contributing to the product innovation and driving hold improvements and customer engagement. In our eye gaming segment net revenues grew 50% for the second consecutive quarter driven by a 33% increase in volume and a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement in hold. Caesars Palace Online continues to grow as a percentage of our total iCasino revenues. We're actively enhancing the product offerings by adding new and exciting game content including exclusively designed Caesars Themed Games. We successfully completed the acquisition of WynnBet's operations in Michigan in June which sets the stage for the introduction of our new iGaming app, which will be branded the Horseshoe in early Q3. As we head to the back half of the year, we continue to be optimistic about the progress we're making in both sports and iCasino and I believe we are well set up for a strong finish to the year. We now offer sports betting in 32 North American jurisdictions 26 of which offer mobile wagering. I'll now pass the call back to Bret for some comments on the balance sheet. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. Strong free cash flow generation of over $100 million in Q2 was applied to permanently reduce our 2030 Term Loan B. Our refinancing activity over the past two years has significantly extended our maturity profile with our nearest maturity now three years away. We continue to monitor the capital markets to opportunistically lower our cost of debt. As Anthony noted previously our elevated capital investment cycle is nearing completion and we expect to see CapEx coming down by roughly $200 million in 2025 setting the stage for increasing free cash flow. Over to Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks. To dig a little more deeply into numbers starting in regional. April was a terrible month for us when we last talked to you. We were obviously in April, you had the Easter calendar shift, it wasn't clear how the month would shake out. But if you look at the decline in regional year-over-year April was more than a 100% of that May and June both were up year-over-year. If you look at Caesars-specific items in the quarter New Orleans were at peak Construction disruption in the center of the casino right now, that's going to continue for the next month or so, so that hits us in this quarter as well. Reno those of you have followed us a long time know that, one of the biggest groups in Reno are the bowlers. This year's bowling group is about 20% of the size of last year. So we're missing well over 40,000 direct room nights from them and likely more as they book through other channels. The combination of those two Items in the quarter cost us over $25 million of EBITDA and those will continue into the third quarter, given the bowlers left end of July last year, New Orleans construction will complete Labor Day. In addition, Churchill's Terre Haute property impacted Indianapolis in the quarter. And we anniversaried the temporary opening in Virginia for about half of the quarter. So as I look forward, I'd expect third quarter looks something like this. Fourth quarter, we get the benefit of a full quarter of New Orleans rolling out its new product. Recall that we've got about $80 million there of incremental gaming revenue, that the way taxes work in New Orleans would be without casino tax to us, and then expect Virginia to open before the end of the year. So I would expect we'd be a grower in the fourth quarter, third quarter probably looks similar to this. And then we feel good about 25 in regional. In Vegas, very pleased with the quarter. Keep in mind we had about $20 million of headwinds between union contract raises plus employees in venues that weren't open last year, so restaurants that were under construction and opened subsequent to second quarter last year. So to fade that 20 and grow, I'm particularly heartened that hold was a non-event in the quarter. We were in our range and the difference quarter-over-quarter was less than the increase in EBITDA. Obviously, we held margins well. Anthony mentioned the two hotel remodels that we did, Coliseum performing quite well. Versailles has knocked the cover off the ball for us. That's Versailles rooms are up $65 in ADR year-over-year, that's almost 60% lift. And that's before the rooms with the balconies came online. Just recently and the connector should open in this quarter that should have further tailwinds on that tower, that's been our most successful hotel renovation in possibly the history of Caesars, certainly since we've been involved. So excited about that. Rest of the year looks strong. Expect Vegas to post growth. I know that that's not what's been reflected in estimates, but we feel very good about the rest of the year into \u201825. Eric talked about digital. Another quarter of nearly 30% net revenue growth, 50% flow through, which is what we've told you that we expect to deliver. July's off to a fantastic start. Growth is in excess of that target. So we feel good about third quarter and then we'll get into, by the end of this quarter, we'll be into football. So feel very good about where digital's headed. Expect that the Horseshoe brand, the second brand in iCasino can help us build on the gains that we've had since we rolled out Caesars Palace online. So momentum in digital is quite strong for us and all of the targets that we've laid out in the past still seem well within our grasp. So feel very good about that. And then as Bret and Anthony both hit on, we will roll out, we'll finish our CapEx cycle that we entered into when we closed the merger in 2020 with the opening of Virginia by the end of the year. That'll bring that CapEx down a couple hundred million gross CapEx, over $500 million. And coupled with what's going on in digital and the brick and mortar portfolio, we're going to see a significant lift in free cash flow. As we stated, you should expect us to be looking for what we'll do with that free cash flow. We continue to plan to reduce debt, to reduce leverage at current levels in the stock. I wouldn't be surprised, you shouldn't be surprised if you see us become a buyer of stock as we get to that inflection point. And with that, I will turn it back for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Greff, with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. I want to start with a question on Las Vegas. Obviously the results were nicely ahead of what we in the industry were forecasting and margins of knocking on 47%, nothing to sneeze at there. Going through some of the various Vegas KPIs that you put in the queue. If I make certain assumptions for slot wins, it looks like the contra gaming revenue, or at least the relationship between casino revenue and gross gaming revenue was very favorable. I mean, the best it's been in four or five, six quarters here. Can you talk about maybe what's driving that and maybe the sustainability of that? And obviously that would lead to a continuation of pretty good margins. Tom Reeg : So Joe, I'd say, from our standpoint, our approach to promotions in Vegas has not changed at all. I'm not looking at my queue, so I don't know what numbers that you're looking at. But what we found is we have pricing power in Las Vegas. We've known that for quite some time. We've got a great team here that has continued to raise the bar. If you look back to the second quarter of \u201822 was our all-time EBITDA record. So two years ago was our all-time EBITDA record. That was State Farm that was a lot of international business coming and paying back. That was pre-union contract. There's about $76 million of headwinds since that quarter. So two years ago, you had $76 million of stuff, whether it was lower expenses or revenue like the State Farm that doesn't recur every year. And our EBITDA is down a little under $30 million from that quarter. So that speaks to our team. We've been able to -- despite %76 million of headwinds, we've eaten through 50 of that. I think that's a testament to how our guys operate out here and we're pretty proud of that. Joe Greff : Great. Then my second question is for you, Tom, or for Eric in digital. Clearly, you're doing a good job on the iCasino side of things. And I'm presuming that has a much higher margin than the OFB revenues. And I know you have a target out there of $500 million in EBITDAR and if you look at the next couple of years and in consensus numbers, no one's sort of forecasting that. But it looks like this year you could be patient to do or knock on a couple of hundred million of EBITDAR in this segment. Is that close to how you're thinking about it internally? Obviously, taking into account what you're forecasting within a couple of quarters. Tom Reeg : Yeah, so a couple of things. I agree with you that iCasino is going to be more profitable from a margin perspective than sports as you look at ultimately more states legalizing. But if you look at the states that are legal now and their tax rate, the delta between margin and iCasino and sports betting is not as large as you would suspect. Last quarter I laid out, we were a $1 billion of net revenue last year. We were about 50 of EBITDA, a little less than that. And talked about growing 30% on the top-line, 50% flow through that should get you in the neighborhood of $200 million. And we're well on our way there this year. So feel good about that. You know, the key will be, can we do it again next year? And then we get the roll off of the partnership contracts that also will flow to the bottom line, and that's how we get to the same 500 we've been talking about for three years now, you'll believe it at some point. Joe Greff : Great. Appreciate the comments. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Carlo Santarelli : Hey, Tom, everybody, Anthony, Bret. I just had two questions, both of which more or less relate to kind of the back half of the year in Las Vegas. The first one, and I just want to make sure I understand this properly. Tom, you talked a little bit about the $20 million of incremental costs, some of which are -- the bulk of which related to the culinary union contract. That contract, if I'm not mistaken, and this is where I'm looking for clarity, will see its next escalator in October, which means that in the 3Q, presumably the only increase you should see from that would relate to whatever you might have under-accrued in the 3Q last year, so relatively minimal. Is my understanding of that correct? Tom Reeg : That's accurate, Carlo. Carlo Santarelli : Okay. Thank you. And then the second one, obviously, World Series of Poker is happening right now. You guys kind of have obviously had that in the properties and has historically been a pretty good cash generator for you, not just for the tournament itself, but gaming play in general. Could you comment a little bit about kind of the holistic impact that brand is having across the assets at present? Tom Reeg : Yeah, so I'll talk about the holistic. Eric can talk about specifics of actual World Series. This was our best World Series ever from a financial perspective. It fills a lot of rooms on the east side of the strip at a time when it can be, as we've noticed recently, almost 120 degrees here, so a good time to have a significant group of gamblers in-house. We see benefits in our hotel. We see benefits in table games. We see benefits in slot play and in our food and beverage that's all ancillary. And hard to quantify, but Eric can talk about the actual economics of the event for us. Eric Hession : Yeah, Carlo, it shows up in our P&L on that other line. It's basically the World Series of Poker plus the skin revenues that we receive from renting our skins in other states. As Tom mentioned, we had a record World Series of Poker here at the venue in Las Vegas. From an economic perspective, it's actually very consistent. The online poker does okay, but doesn't make a huge amount of money, and then the royalty streams and the land-based casinos where the economics are, it makes between $20 million and $25 million for the year as a whole. That's an EBITDA number, and then the balance is going to be the skins that you see there in that other line. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, guys. Then if I could, just one quick follow-up. Anthony, you mentioned 25 group pace for Las Vegas had strengthened in the period. Could you kind of give some parameters, i.e., what's booked, what you expect mix could be, pace, things of that nature? Anthony Carano : Yeah, Carlo, I think we'll see about mid-single digits above this year and going up into the mid-teens of mix for the market, so a tick up there as well. The team's been doing a great job in future bookings and has really, as I said, come in very strong in the last couple of months for \u201825. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open. Brandt Montour : Hi, everybody. Good afternoon or good evening, and thanks for taking my question. I first want to talk about the hotel room rate. If we back into room rates out of the queue, at least from what we can see, it seems like a nice acceleration of room rate in Las Vegas quarter over quarter. I was curious, Tom, if you want to speculate on how much of that -- well, there's some from obviously from Reno leaving. Also, you mentioned the dynamics of hotel supply coming out of the strip, and maybe there's just incremental compression that you're finding and you're able to yield up your assets here sequentially. How do you think about that, and how do you feel about the sustainability of that into the rest of the year? Tom Reeg : Yeah, Brandt, we've not seen a lot of elasticity when it comes to pricing in Vegas, so we have continued to take price kind of across the board, not just rooms, restaurants, ATM fees, pool cabanas. There's just a massive amount of demand for Vegas, and that has continued. And if you look at where we're driving, we're driving a lot of it through non-gaming, and gaming is holding up well. And so that leads to more EBITDA overall, which is great. Brandt Montour : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Eric over in digital, hoping you could talk a little bit about the dynamic with handle looking flat again year-over-year in this quarter. And I know we talked about this last quarter, and you're getting a lot of growth from parlay mix and stepped up Hold there. How long can that dynamic carry you in terms of your getting overall OSB revenue growth to compound to the longer-term EBITDA -- to get to the longer-term EBITDA targets that you guys have laid out? Is that sustainable, or do you need to go back and start growing player counts and volumes again here over the medium term? Eric Hession : Yeah, it's a good question, and it's been a couple quarters that we've had, basically flat volume and increased hold, and thus increased revenues on the sports betting side. We've taken some actions from a reinvestment perspective, and then also from a wagering perspective that have impacted the volumes. And one way to think about it is, as I mentioned on the previous quarter, we had just recently been able to launch our new marketing system that allows us to provide segmented marketing, trigger-based marketing, and a much more customized approach. Prior to that, we were investing with a much more peanut butter spread approach, and it caused us to be over-investing in some of the lower end of the database. So, we've reduced that, and as you'd expect, the volumes have dropped off, but the profitability has gone up. And so, the business that we are getting isn't really business that you'd be too concerned about losing because it was unprofitable. I think that what you'll start to see is revenue growth start this quarter, and it'll accelerate as we start to lap some of the actions that we took. So, I do think you'll see solid volume growth starting, and the hold will continue to grow. And so that should compound as we head into the back half of the year. Brandt Montour : Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Dan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First on regionals, Tom, you mentioned that most of the decline in the quarter was coming from April, and that June was actually up. As we look at the gross gaming revenues for what's reportable, it looks to tell a different story. So, when you mention that, are you talking about net revenues, and how do we kind of reconcile this? Is there a dynamic with promotions going on that is also worth maybe talking about? Tom Reeg : Dan, we've known each other a long time. I only talk about EBITDA. So, whatever's going on in gross gaming revenue, I'm not paying attention to. We have not changed our promotional profile in any piece of our business. We were off, what, 30 something for the quarter, and 25 plus of that was New Orleans and Reno, as I described. So, the regional business as a whole continues to bump along. Obviously, as we've seen, you've got months that are not as strong and others that are stronger. April, for us is as I said was more than a 100% of the decline. Both May and June grew in EBITDA, but there's nothing we're doing in promotions nor are there anything we see others doing that we need to respond to in that segment. Dan Politzer : Got that's helpful. And then in terms of the M&A environment there's obviously been a lot in the headlines lately. Do you view your stock price here as a limiting factor to getting involved or are there opportunities that you could see notwithstanding where your stock is trading just given some of the headlines that we've seen out there? Tom Reeg : I'd say we're just reading the same headlines you are. We're not even tangentially involved in whatever's happening at Penn [ph] which I know that's where your questions going. In terms of what we'll do and we I've said before that we are mindful that we've generated a lot of shareholder value through M&A through external opportunities. The M&A that we've driven value through in the greatest form have used stock as a significant portion of our payment for those assets. I'm not an issuer of stock at $36 wherever it was today. We're going to be a significant even more significant free cash flow producer as these as the project spend runs down. So that will open up a leg of shareholder returns so you should expect us to start buying in some of our stock. If the stock moves to a different neighborhood that can change. I think all things equal will drive more value if we continue to execute external opportunities but I'm not going to give our stock away so that's where we sit today. Dan Politzer : Got it and then if I could just sneak in one quick clarification. You mentioned for the regionals in the third quarter it will look similar to the second quarter. I'm assuming that was you know a declining by a similar amount year-over-year correct? Tom Reeg : Yeah we have the same. We're dealing with all three that impacted us in the second quarter in the third quarter. So New Orleans peak disruption till Labor Day, Terre Haute obviously we're going through I guess the second quarter -- second full quarter since opening. And then the Reno group impact extended into July last year. So all three will be headwinds this quarter. I think you start to flip toward the end of the quarter as New Orleans opens and then as you get to fourth quarter and Virginia opens, I'd expect we're growing in that segment again. Recall that the win per position in the temporary in Virginia is the highest in the entire enterprise and will be about doubling gaming capacity when we move to the permanent. So that should be a strong driver. And I've already hit on the way the New Orleans casino revenue will flow through in the initial stages. Dan Politzer : Got it. Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from one of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Your line is open. Steven Wieczynski : Yeah guys good afternoon. Tom, another quick clarification here. When you were talking about Vegas for the second half of this year, were you basically saying that you think you can grow EBITDA for the full year year-over-year in Vegas? Did I hear that right? Tom Reeg : You did not. I'd expect Vegas to grow in the second half of the year both third and fourth quarter. We would as -- I said on last quarter's call we would need a swing in hold that offsets our hold impact from first quarter to be a grower for the year. Steven Wieczynski : Okay thank you for that. And then in the -- just going through the queue and I know you don't have it in front of you, but there was comment in the regional segment, which basically said -- you saw a little bit of decline in your gaming volumes, which was basically a mix shift. Basically, your rated play remains steady with some growth but the unrated play had some reduction there. And I was just wondering if that unrated play reduction, is that pretty much across the entire portfolio? Or are there certain geographies where you're seeing a little bit more pressure on that unrated play? Tom Reeg : I would say there's always variability in a portfolio of our size. You feel it more in unrated and rated, where unrated is worse off than, call it, the average regional property. It's due to a competitive opening in the same geography. So if you think about how does Terre Haute affect us, we had people that were coming from a couple of hours away from Indianapolis to the West. And now you've got -- you've lost some of them for good because Terre Haute much more convenient and then you're going to have a battle around somewhere in between you like you have at other properties. And if I'm looking at unrated versus rated, it's like -- it's more unrated and the decline in unrated in that property would be more than our typical regional because of that competition. Steven Wieczynski : Okay, got you. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Brian Agnew : In the interest of time for the remaining participants asking questions, can we please limit it to one question and then we'll try to take some follow-ups. So we've got a bunch of people in the queue that we want to get to. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just in the spirit of time, Eric, I wanted to go back to sort of the CAC or promotional environment a little bit and just in terms of what you're seeing in digital. Obviously, 50% flow-through in the quarter is great. Have you seen any environment -- environmental change and especially as you're thinking about ramping or seeing ramping volumes on the OSB side? Because I think there's some increasing trepidation about flow-through rates as we start to look into the third and fourth quarter. And obviously, I think there's a lot of expected competition in new products expected to be rolled out, particularly around the NFL season opener. Thanks. Eric Hession : Yeah, sure. I would say that over the last kind of two to three months, we've seen the cost of acquisition drop fairly significantly on the sports betting side. It's kind of across the board, both on paid search, paid social. The affiliates are contractually based, but even there to a little bit degree. So from the sports betting side, I would say that the intensity has dropped from acquiring customers. On the casino side, I would say that the costs have remained pretty constant for us throughout the year. On the casino side, we definitely target a certain CAC for each of the channels. And then we don't go above that. And certainly, instances, we're not able to satisfy the amount of money we would have spent otherwise because the demand is not there and it does drop off in the summer to some degree. So I would expect that our spend would go up just in aggregate dollars as we head into the third and fourth quarter, particularly in late August and September as everybody signs up for football. But in terms of the cost per acquisition, I'm seeing nothing at this point that would indicate a real change from the trends in the last few months. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the -- Brian Agnew : Hello? Operator : Stephen, your line is open. Check if you're on mute. Unidentified Analyst : I couldn't hear that was my name, if it [Indiscernible] for a second. Can you hear me? Brian Agnew : Yeah, you're good. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah. So one other on digital, given the strong flow through and as you open up Horseshoe Casino, should we anticipate any kind of investment behind that, that could reverse some of the operating leverage we've seen? And is there any thoughts that you can provide on how quickly you think that brand launch could build from here? Tom Reeg : No on launch costs eating into flow through. You saw us launch Caesars Palace online with generating this kind of flow through. I'd expect nothing different here. Eric, do you want to speak on expectations if that was built. Eric Hession : Yeah. We're launching it slightly differently than we did with Caesars Palace, where we're going to do effectively one state at a time. So pending regulatory approvals, we're going to launch in Michigan in September time frame. And then we'll roll out into the other states throughout the year, ending in Ontario in Q1. So from that standpoint, it will be a little bit different. I also would tamper the expectations just Horseshoe is a great brand, and it really -- we feel like it's going to resonate with a lot of customers. But Caesars is even a better brand. And quite frankly, that's going to be the flagship app that we have, and it's got a year's lead over the Horseshoe. So I would expect the Horseshoe to perform very strongly, but I don't think it will command the market share that Caesars as well. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Barry Jonas : Illinois recently raised its OSB tax rate. Curious if there are ways you can talk about maybe to offset that higher tax and at the same time, does that graduated tax system in the state offer you maybe an opportunity to gain share? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yeah. Because of the graduated tax, I think we're not in favor of tax increases at all but the graduated tax is certainly favorable, I think, to a flat tax, the impact to us is under $5 million a year. We're not planning to change our behavior based on that change. If some of the others that are impacted more changed their reinvestment levels or their odds or some other type of action that they take in the state. It's potentially beneficial to us. But at this point, I haven't really seen anything that would indicate that that's happening. Barry Jonas : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John DeCree with CBRE. Your line is open. John DeCree : Thanks, everyone. Maybe one more on the M&A front, Tom. I think your views on the buy side are pretty clear. Curious if you speak to your strategy or any thoughts on possibly selling some stuff or culling the portfolio on the non-core side that might not maybe fit the overall enterprise at this point? Tom Reeg : Yeah, John, how do you like Agnew laying down the hammer? But John, on sales, you shouldn't expect that we're going to sell any operating casino assets. As I said previously, there are non-core, non-operating casino assets in the portfolio that I think could trade at a significantly accretive multiple for us, and you should expect us to try to take advantage of those opportunities. So no change there. John DeCree : Thank you. I'll get out of the queue quickly to avoid the hammer. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open. David Katz : After, everyone. One more for Eric. As we get to that 500, can you paint a picture for us as to what the mix looks like between iGaming and sports betting, how much of each? Anything qualitative would help us. Thank you. Eric Hession : Sure. I think that the growth rates -- the relative growth rates of the two sports betting and iCasino are going to continue. As we mentioned, the Caesars Palace online app continues to grow as a percentage of our iCasino business. So it's accelerating at a faster than 50% pace obviously, it's just over a year old. And then I think that the Horseshoe app will be incremental to that. And so you'll see the iCasino app continue to grow at a significantly faster pace than the sports betting side. From the sports betting side, we do feel like there's still going to be solid growth there, but it's probably going to be more like you're seeing now where it's in the 20% range. And so over time, the relative revenues from those two will converge. And as Tom mentioned, we do have a slightly higher blended tax rate on the casino side. So the flow through is a little bit lower on that incremental revenue. But eventually, I think that the iCasino will be more profitable than the sports betting in total dollars. David Katz : Helpful. Thank you. Hammer avoided. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open. Chad Beynon : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of Vegas, Tom, first off, thanks for the commentary in terms of growth in the back half of '24. With respect to Q2, did you see any major difference in terms of the tiers of the property -- and then, I guess, more importantly, since we've seen some capacity come out, should we expect that there's a rising boat effect? Or does that actually help some of your mid-end properties given what's come out of the market? Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yeah, Chad. So I've seen the rhetoric around maybe the non-luxury properties are underperforming luxury. That's not what we're finding in our portfolio, all of our properties are performing in a similar fashion. Obviously, Caesars Palace has the bulk of our highest end business. So it's the most volatile from a table games perspective, but in terms of visitation, pricing power growth, they all look pretty similar for us. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Tom Reeg : And then I'm sorry, on closing the Mirage, I think that's a mixed bag for us. I think it's helpful in terms of -- there's less rooms in the market, we'll get our share of those rooms. But given its proximity to our existing properties, we think that it served as a feeder theaters to our other assets that you state at Mirage and if you went walking, you probably ended up at one of our properties. So I really don't think that's going to be a material driver in either direction. I think we'll benefit from a little more occupancy be able to yield a little bit better, but we lose that 3,000-plus rooms in the neighborhood that would have you feed each other. Chad Beynon : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathon Novaretti [ph] with TD Cowen. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Tom, in the third quarter of '22, you said that VICI has been clear with Caesars that they had the intention to exercise the option on the sensor assets. I know it's been a lot since then, but has the current regional performance changed this? Or do you still expect to get around -- but I think you mentioned $2.5 billion in gross proceeds. And just if you were to get those $2.5 billion or whatever it ends up being in net proceeds, would all of that be earmarked to repay that? Or can we expect some capital return as well? Thank you. Tom Reeg : Yes. Thanks for the question. VICI you'd have to ask them that is their option in terms of calling the real estate under the Indianapolis assets by the end of the year. We have a put option that we will not exercise. We've been pretty clear on that since we have this option became into existence. The proceeds are formulaic, so 1.3 times coverage, 13 times EBITDA. The last I check that gets to like $2.2 billion, something like that. If we were to get those proceeds that -- the bulk of those, you should expect would pay down debt. But yeah, you should also expect that there would be some return of capital element as well. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Your line is open. Jordan Bender : Good afternoon, everyone. In your Q, you give sports sponsorship obligations. That number has increased pretty substantially in the last several years, which I assume is just driven by the online business. My question is, in the event that we face some consumer weakness across really any part of your portfolio. Do you have the flexibility to reduce your exposure to some of that? Tom Reeg : Yeah. So those sports sponsorship deals were all signed as we launched the Caesars Sports app in 2021, they had varying terms. So some have rolled off already ESPN being the big one that rolled off as they launched ESPN. But we have still significant pieces that roll off or mature in a bulk of them in early '26 and we expect to see significant savings there that will flow directly to bottom line. Brian Agnew : Jordan, just to be clear, those contractual obligations have been declining on a go-forward basis in the Q. We can go through it offline afterwards. Jordan Bender : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Daniel Guglielmo : Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. For each segment, it looks like you all found expense efficiencies this quarter versus last quarter. Is there anything specific across the company that you all can point to there? And can we expect those margin levels remain -- to hold through the second half, understanding there's some seasonality there? Tom Reeg : Yeah. I really can't point to an overarching big one. It's a lot of little stuff. Like if you looked at our Vegas quarterly review, there's a full page of things that both on the revenue or expense side added a few hundred thousand dollars or maybe $1 million or $2 million. It's just -- this is kind of who we've been since we've become a public company in terms of constantly trying to run more efficiently, and that's what you're seeing as a result of that, I would expect margins save for seasonality to hold up. Well, obviously, we've held up in the face of a significant lift in labor costs in Vegas. We're not going to see anything in any of our segments, that's nearly that impactful. And as we talked about in Carlo's earlier question, we're through year 1, the subsequent lifts in Vegas are much smaller than the year one lift was. Daniel Guglielmo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Please standby for our next question. We have a follow-up question from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open. Your line is open, David, check to see if you're on mute. David Katz : Sorry about that. I just wanted to follow up on the comment, Tom, about regionals. I think what you're referencing for 3Q is a similar decline of down 8%, not a similar number of 469 of EBITDA, correct? Tom Reeg : Yeah. And I don't even know that I'm pointing to 8%. I'm telling you, we're facing the same headwinds that we faced in the second quarter. So I would expect third quarter regional to fall short of 2023. Don't take that as I'm telling you it's 8%. I'm just telling you we're facing the same step. David Katz : Yeah, got. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Reeg for closing remarks. Tom Reeg : All right. Thanks everybody. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, Treasury and Investor Relations, Brian Agnew. Brian Agnew : Well, thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Welcome to our conference call to discuss our third quarter 2024 earnings. This afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the period ending September 30, 2024. A copy of the press release is available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.caesars.com. Additionally, we announced two press releases, one for the completion of the World Series of Poker sale and then we just a late press release just hit for the sale of the LINQ Promenade, which Tom Reeg will discuss in more detail during his remarks. Joining me on the call today are Tom Reeg, our CEO; Anthony Carano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bret Yunker, our CFO; Eric Hession, President, Caesars Sports and Online Gaming; and Charise Crumbley, Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Anthony, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements under safe harbor federal securities laws, and these statements may or may not come true. Also during today's call, the company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Reg G. Please visit our Press Releases located on our Investor Relations website for a reconciliation of the differences between each non-GAAP financial measure and the comparable GAAP financial measure. I will now turn the call over to Anthony. Anthony Carano : Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Our third quarter delivered same-store consolidated net revenues of $2.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion. Results were driven by record non-gaming performance in Las Vegas and an all-time quarterly EBITDA record in our Digital segment, offset by new competition, construction disruption, and tough year-over-year comparisons in our Regional segment. Consolidated EBITDA margins of 35% for the quarter were flat to the prior year. In Las Vegas, our team delivered same-store net revenue of a billion dollars and adjusted EBITDA of $472 million, down 2% versus last year. Las Vegas segment results were driven by another record performance in hotel and F&B cash revenue, driven by strong ADRs and occupancy of 97.1%. Our Group and Convention segment continues to deliver strong operating results and pace into 2025 has recently accelerated. Las Vegas segment EBITDAR margins of 44.4% were roughly flat year-over-year, driven by lower same-store operating expenses, a testament to our focus on driving efficiencies. Looking forward, we remain optimistic regarding operating trends as we look to the fourth quarter and into next year, driven by strong occupancy and ADR trends. In our Regional segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $498 million, down 13% year-over-year. This quarter was met with tough comparisons to the prior year, especially in Reno, competitive pressures in certain markets, and peak construction disruption in New Orleans. On October 22, we celebrated the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Caesars New Orleans, a $435 million capital project. The completely renovated and rebranded property added a new 340-room hotel, remodeled casino floor, and several high-profile F&B outlets for many of our celebrity chef partners, including Emeril, Nina Compton, Bobby Flay, and Nobu. Additionally, we are looking forward to the opening of our permanent facility in Danville, Virginia in December. The openings in Danville and New Orleans will complete the elevated CapEx cycle for the company as we now turn to harvesting the investment we made in these flagship destinations. Our team members continued to deliver exceptional guest experiences as a result of their continued hard work and dedication. I want to thank all of our team members for their contributions to our strong results. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric for some detail on the third quarter results in our Caesars Digital segment. Eric Hession : Thanks, Anthony. Caesars Digital delivered third quarter net revenues of $303 million, up 41% year-over-year, which drove an all-time quarterly adjusted EBITDA record of $52 million versus just $2 million a year ago. With this performance, we have now generated trailing 12-months EBITDA of $126 million. Our net revenue flow through to EBITDA in the quarter was slightly above our planned 50% range. In our iGaming segment, our net revenue growth rate accelerated in the quarter to 83%, driven by a 55% increase in volume and a 40 basis point increase in year-over-year hold. Our standalone Caesars Palace app continues to grow as a percentage of our total iCasino revenues. Subsequent to quarter-end, we launched the Horseshoe Casino brand in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia with plans for Ontario and New Jersey by year end. In our Sports Betting segment, our net revenue growth also accelerated in the quarter to 36% year-over-year, driven primarily based by increased hold of 8.6% versus 6.5% last year. Enhancements we've made to the app drove higher parlay and cash-out mix, which helped drive structural hold improvements during the quarter. Given our roadmap and our customers' receptivity to the enhanced parlay options, we now believe that achieving structural hold above 10% threshold is achievable over the next few years. As a result, you should expect to see consistently increasing structural hold as we are working off a relatively low baseline. In both iCasino and Sports, we're starting to see improved retention as a result of our segmented marketing campaigns. If you recall, we started constructing and testing the campaigns in April of this year. We currently have 40 campaigns active and are optimistic that further refinement in this area will drive additional improvements as we head into 2025. We now offer sports betting in 32 North American jurisdictions, 26 of which offer mobile wagering. I'll now pass the call over to Bret for some comments on the balance sheet. Bret Yunker : Thanks, Eric. In October, we printed a $1.1 billion senior unsecured bond issuance at 6% with proceeds applied to our 08/08/2027 bond maturity. Our sale of the World Series of Poker brand closed today, yielding $250 million of upfront cash proceeds and $250 million five year note. We repaid our revolver balance in full and intend to use the bulk of incremental asset sale proceeds to further reduce debt. Reducing debt alongside reductions in our fixed and floating rate cost of debt will yield significant cash interest expense savings going forward. Our 2025 budgeted cash CapEx excluding our Danville JV is approximately $600 million. Go ahead, Tom. Tom Reeg : Thanks, Bret. To start with some general housekeeping in the quarter, there's $10 million-ish of expense in the corporate line-item this quarter that I would view as one-time but was not added back to EBITDA relating to lobbying efforts primarily in Missouri and adverse claims impact in our healthcare. Taking each segment one at a time, a reason I told you last quarter that what we were anticipating was continuation of what we saw in the second quarter where New Orleans would be significantly impaired on a year-over-year basis due to disruption. Reno would be impaired because of lack of a significant group that was in the business last year. Both of those came true. I didn't have -- our friends at Boyd opened their treasure chest moved to land base at a -- particularly fortuitous time relative to what was happening at our New Orleans property where the bulk of the gaming floor was under construction. So New Orleans had a particularly difficult quarter. If I look at regionals across the enterprise, we have significant properties that were -- continue to be impacted by incremental competition. We've got Horseshoe, Indianapolis with Terre Haute. We've got Tunica with Southland. We've got our three Chicago properties with the various Chicago market, Illinois openings and we've got Council Bluffs, which has been impacted by the [Racino] openings in Nebraska. We've really not had tailwinds to speak of within the portfolio in terms of things we were doing that would offset them. That changed in last week when we opened Caesars New Orleans, as we've talked about repeatedly, there's a significant opportunity for very high flow through incremental revenue there because of the way the tax structure is set up in New Orleans. The property turned out beautifully. Anthony went through the particulars of what we added, but the early reception has been tremendous. We're very, very optimistic about what happens in New Orleans. Also Virginia will open before the end of the year. That's a significant increase in gaming positions in a property that is our highest win-per-position property in the enterprise. So we're very excited about that as well. The last thing I'd say about regional in the quarter is, as you know, we have properties along the Gulf Coast and in Florida, and there was some weather impact from -- that hit those due to the storms during the quarter, hopeful that that's non-recurring. As you look toward '25, we sit here almost November 1, so we start to think about '25, we will have tailwinds in New Orleans and Virginia that start to offset some of these competitive impacts in Regional. So we feel very good about the way '25 looks versus the last two quarters in Regional for us. Looking to Vegas, what I told you last quarter is we'd expect to be flat to up for the third quarter. We ended up coming in down about $10 million in EBITDA. If you look at the specifics of that, that's all table-hold related. So our non-gaming revenue and cash flow were records. Our slot handle and wind was flat, it was table-hold that was the laggard. It was not poor table-hold. It was within our range of expectations, just not as strong as last year. As you look to Vegas moving forward, feel good about the fourth quarter where we've got Versailles Tower online where it was not online last year. Early returns there are quite strong. We also had the catch-up accrual for the union contract in the fourth quarter that will not recur. And then you look into -- and I also want to touch on -- I know there's been a lot of chatter on F1 in and fourth quarter generally in the market. For us, recall, F1 was about $17 million, $18 million lift last year in EBITDA versus the same quarter, the same weekend in '22. If I were looking at '23 for that -- for the race in particular, I would say flat-to-down a couple of million dollars versus last year, but highly dependent on hold given that say high-end business. So really from an investment perspective, from where -- what it's doing to our cash flow on a -- versus last year basis, it's not worth mentioning except that you've had all this chatter in the market. Our cash room revenue for the quarter, I know that you see rate surveys that are muddied by all that went on with F1 last year. I'd expect our cash room revenue to be up year-over-year slightly for the fourth quarter. So really nothing to read into Vegas other than continued strength. As we look into '25, again, first quarter was a difficult quarter for us hold-wise. You were kind of the left-side to standard deviations in terms of where our hold would normally be. So we would expect that we recoup some of that in the first quarter. And then I'd say you're looking at flat to slightly up as you look out through the rest of the year. The Convention segment, the group business for next year was stronger in '24 than '23 and will be stronger in '25 than '24. And then if we go to digital, it tremendously pleased with the way digital has been coming together. Eric talked about over 40% top-line growth in aggregate, 83% in iGaming, which is extraordinary. We had been outpacing our peers in growth by about 2 times coming into the quarter. I'd expect we're closer to 3 times in the third quarter and that was without the rollout of the Horseshoe brand. Feel very good about the rollout of that brand. We've got data on Michigan. We've kind of got a full month or so now in Michigan where that was the -- that's how we migrated the WynnBet customers that we acquired over into our -- onto our Horseshoe brand. And not only did we not have friction where we lost customers, we actually grew that business versus where it was when it was Wynn. We've recently launched Pennsylvania and West Virginia and expect that to be a further building block in iCasino after a 83% growth in the quarter. This month is still growing on a sequential basis month-over-month. So feel very, very good about what's happening there. All of the targets that we've laid out, I know that we talk about this all the time. There's really no change to our expectations. We'd expect to have a strong fourth quarter, notwithstanding October has been not the best sporting outcomes but you got a lot of the quarter left and a lot of heavy sports calendar for the next 60 days where we feel we can start to clot some of that back, but I'd expect a very good fourth quarter and then into next year, expect continued strong growth as Eric said, structural hold continues to increase in our business. You can see that in our results and coupled with what's going on in iGaming, I think the future is very bright for our digital business. I think that business is going to end up generating a hell of a lot more than the $500 million target that everybody has been ringing their hands about for the last three years. So we feel very good about that. Stepping over to kind of strategic and financial. We announced the sale of the Promenade retail lease portfolio to retail and F&B lease portfolio today. The multiple on that trade is about 14 times. So you can do that math, that EBITDA will come out. That was all in the Vegas segment. So that comes out next year. We announced -- we executed $140 million share buyback in the third quarter, you should expect that as we -- we've talked about --we've gotten to our inflection point from a capital spending standpoint with Virginia opening, you should expect CapEx down year-on -- next year to be running on a gross basis $600 million to $650 million. So significantly below where we've been the last couple of years. By the end of this year, we'll have paid back -- we will have reduced debt by 25% in absolute numbers since we closed the Caesars transaction. Debt reduction remains our number one priority, but we did execute the $140 million share buyback. We've got another $500 million authorized. You should not expect a programmatic use of this authorization. It's not going to be X amount per quarter as far as the eye can see, we're going to be looking at returns in the various possibilities in terms of our capital spending, debt reduction, and share repurchase. Debt reduction will remain our number one focus. But if we can continue to buy our stock in the mid-teens or better free cash flow yield, you should expect us to be active there as free cash flow comes in and cash flow from our asset sales comes in. So you should expect a piece of this Promenade sale does get used during the quarter for repurchase. In terms of future asset sale activity, we have discussions around non-core assets that are ongoing, but I would tell you that World Series and Promenade were the two easiest ones to execute on, although Brian, who spearheaded Promenade might dispute that Promenade was an easy one. But these were the two simplest ones for us to execute. So you should believe that we're still working down that path, but that the stuff that we're working on has longer tail and/or lower probability than the two that were executed. But as we look into '25, Bret talked about our refinancing. Every 100 basis points of rate reduction from the Fed is $60 million of incremental free-cash flow for us. So they're 50 basis-point first move is $30 million a year for us. The unsecured note offering that Bret just executed in the quarter is another $20 million. So you've got $50 million incremental annual coming in. You've got a much lower lease step-up this year just because of the mechanics of the leases and you've got a significant step-down in capital expenditures. So our free cash flow is going to increase dramatically as we move forward. So we think we can continue to reduce debt and we can buy back stock responsibly. And that's our plan as we move forward. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli : Hi, thanks. Eric, if I could start with you, it looks like in the digital side, if reading through the queue that you guys seem to take about 300 basis-points out of your promotional investment. With the launch of the second brand on the iCasino side, should we expect that to kind of continue to -- I guess, continue to reduce or do you have to put a little bit more reinvestment into that in the near term? And could you talk a little bit about -- I don't know how much you'd be able to go into detail on it, but the sports reinvestment strategy versus the iCasino promotional reinvestment strategy from here? Eric Hession : Yes, I'm glad you brought that last point up because there is a different strategy between the two. On the Sports side, you'll notice in the states that report the reinvestment levels, were generally about half of what the market average is. And we feel that that's an appropriate strategy through our segmented marketing that may have the opportunity to come down even further. But that -- on the Sports side, we're definitely on the lower end of reinvestment and we're able to keep our share roughly constant. On the Casino side, we're very much in line with the market, we believe. That's a bit of a different strategy on that strategy as you've seen, we believe that because of the brand, because of the app that we have because of our database, and because of the opportunities that we have from the brick-and-mortar side, we think that there's a real opportunity to grow that business and grow share significantly as we've been doing this year and this quarter. And so we are investing at a higher rate kind of right in line with the market. I wouldn't anticipate that changing with the launch of the Horseshoe. We're going to invest again kind of consistently with the market on that product as well. I do think that our higher hold that we had in September through good sporting outcomes drove down the reinvestment that's reported in the quarter a bit. But broadly speaking, it should be in this range of around 20%, 22%. Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you. And then, Tom, just for a follow-up, or Anthony, whoever wants to take this one, but you guys talked about kind of the outlook for Las Vegas and feeling fairly good about what 2025 looks like. Just in terms of visibility on the Group side, are there any kind of metrics you could provide? And additionally, is there anything from a citywide perspective that might be somewhat underappreciated at this point? Anthony Carano : Carlo, I don't think anything from a citywide perspective is underappreciated. I think the Group and Convention segment continues to do a really good job filling out the forum and the rest of the space within the enterprise. But at a super high level, we would expect occupied room nights and rate to drive higher group total revenues and EBITDA in '25. So it's pacing to set another new record for the segment. So that's a good way to be thinking about it now. Carlo Santarelli : Yes. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Joe Greff : Good afternoon, everybody. Tom, I was originally going to ask you a question about how you view your priorities in '25 and deploying excess free cash flow, but I think you kind of fleshed that out. The only kind of related question I have to that is, after closing on the World Series of Poker sale and then announcing today the LINQ Promenade sale and you mentioned you have some other non-core asset sales that you're working on. Is it fair to assume that the other non-core asset sales are smaller in size and scale than these two that you've announced and closed on? Tom Reeg : No, I'd just say they're more complex and much longer tail to come together. So in terms of chunkiness, we've got assets that are -- if you're thinking about a 275 to 500 at either ends 275 being prominent and 500 being World Series, I'd be thinking about in terms of in between those numbers. But again, complexity, timeline, probability are different than the ones that we've already executed. Joe Greff : Great. Thank you for that. Eric, going to you on the iCasino side. I know it's been a month or less than a month in terms of launching Horseshoe. Can you talk about sort of the early launch and what you're seeing, particularly as you go from mono-brand to multi-brand? What you're seeing on the existing Caesars Palace online performance? And then, Tom, you referenced again the $500 million of annual EBITDA in digital at some point in the future. When you sit here now and you think about what you've been doing in iCasino as well as what you've been executing on in OSB, how much -- how do you break out between the $500 million related to iCasino? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yes. So to take your first question, Joe, it is very early. We have turned on maybe half our avenue -- marketing avenues at this point. The one thing that I would say is we did convert over the Wynn customers since we took over their skin and they converted over very well. They're playing well and they are contributing the majority of the business right now. We're obviously signing up customers daily, and so that percentage will go down over time in Michigan, but we got a nice jump start by having those customers already active and convert them over. So I think what you'll see in the next month or so as we ramp up a little bit more of the advertising and marketing, particularly in now that we have three states live, then we'll be able to get a better feel for the actual growth rate. But everything we're seeing is positive. Customers like the app, they're staying on the app. I would say that the average worth of the customer is slightly higher so far than on the Caesars app, but it is early to draw any conclusions from that. Tom Reeg : And Joe, on your question of Sports versus iGaming, in our 500, the expectation is that would be fairly well 50-50, give or take a few points. Obviously, that means iGaming on a per-state basis moves the needle dramatically more than Sports Betting. So if and when there are additional iGaming states as we move forward, those would be more impactful than a new Sports Betting state for us. And also keep in mind, what we're doing in iGaming is after we were very late to the game. Recall, in the prior, William Hill didn't have any real iCasino business developed to speak of. So we had to build the app, the brand, actually two brands and roll them out into a market where our peers had already been operating for multiple years. So we're pretty excited. If you look forward and there are future iCasino states, as Eric said, we operate from a marketing standpoint in iGaming pretty similarly to our peers. So we're curious in the future to see a state rollout in our new form with our new brands. Joe Greff : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brandt Montour with Barclays. Brandt Montour : Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So first question is on OSB. Tom, you mentioned October, we've all been watching with bated breath here. I know you haven't even closed the books on the month, but maybe you could compare and contrast how October OSB is faring versus last November? And if the structural hold, Eric, that you've mentioned and that lift is acting as a cushion versus those adverse sport outcomes? Tom Reeg : Short answer is no. The -- so two weekends ago was the -- single worst combination of Sports Betting outcomes we've seen since we started the business. The week before last was not good, but not as bad as two weeks ago. The other two weeks in October were kind of normal. But your shift to -- the shift to parlays cuts against you when you have sporting outcomes like that where our parlay percentage is much higher than it was last November. And so when -- what was it every favorite but one won that week, that's a tough set of outcomes. So yes, so October is not going to look great for anybody relative to what they were expecting, but this is just part of the business that you're in. I don't think it makes any difference to the structural story for us or for anybody else in this space. Brandt Montour : That's very clear. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up still on digital. The hold that you saw in iGaming year-over-year, the lift. Just curious how we should think about that if there's structural things going on or if it's just something that will sort of oscillate around these levels from here. Tom Reeg : I mean, I'd say a big piece of it is more slots versus tables. So the launch of Caesars Palace online, remember the idea was our existing Liberty-based iGaming business was table heavy since you were coming through the sports app. That's a lower hold more volatile business than the predictability of slots and that's really what you saw roll through our numbers in the quarter. Brandt Montour : Great. Thanks, everyone. Tom Reeg : So that should continue. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Dan Politzer : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I think that there was a cash inflow or distribution from Pompano in the quarter, or maybe $40 million or so. Is that something we should think about coming in on a continual basis or could you give additional context there? And along with -- along those lines, maybe if you could shed some light on how we should think about maybe the parameters through which we should look at free cash flow for next year as it relates to interest expense or cash taxes in addition to some of the items you gave earlier. Thanks. Tom Reeg : Yes. So I'll flip to Bret on the cash flow question. In terms of Pompano, yes, as it turns out, the way that we're developing the project with Cordish, it's heavy on outright sales of land to entities that are building the various pieces. So we started to distribute cash as a partnership during the second quarter and your number is pretty close to where we were. And yes, you should expect there are some future distributions of that size in the coming quarters as additional pieces of that project get underway. Bret Yunker : Dan, on the free cash flow bridge for '25, we're looking at rents going up just under 2%. So you should be right at around $1.35 billion on the rent number. On cash CapEx, we already talked about $600 million to $650 million depending on if you're picking up Danville or not. Cash interest expense depends on the pace of the Fed, but we're looking at $650 million to $750 million on cash interest expense. And then you can pick your EBITDA, but when you get down to free cash flow, your cash taxes will be roughly 15% to 20% of the free cash flow number. Dan Politzer : Got it. And then just turning to Danville. Obviously, that property is running at a high level right now. I think slots 550 to 600 win per unit per day and tables are doing well too. So as you think about kind of adding those gaming positions, broad strokes, is there any kind of directional -- directional guidance or expectation as you kind of expand that property? And then any kind of color on how we should think about margins relative to a full property versus a temporary property. Tom Reeg : Yes. So that will be margin-dilutive certainly. That's running in the neighborhood of 60% EBITDA margins out of the tent, you should be looking at something more like our other regionals kind of mid-30s or better going forward. You've talked about the win per position per day, the actual win per position per day, I've told you, it's the largest in our system. It will be dilutive to that as well, but you're looking at almost double the position. So if you think about it, you're going to generate significantly more revenue, but you're going to have significantly more expense. So if you think about the total piece of the total view of EBITDA, I would say, just cuffing it two-thirds to 70% of the total EBITDA was already being generated by the temporary property, but it's a meaningful lift to our regional segment to get the permanent. Dan Politzer : That's helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. Steven Wieczynski : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So just in the interest of time here, I'll just ask one question. So Tom, if we kind of take a step back and think about how -- a couple of years ago, you talked about how there was a potential chance to sell an asset along the strip, and all that went away obviously due to the rate environment. But if we fast-forward to today, and obviously, we're starting to get a much better rate environment out there. I guess, my question is, are you starting to see the demand come back in terms of inbound interest for some of your assets? And I'm not sitting here trying to say you're doing anything, or you're not doing anything. I just want to know more if that interest level is as strong as it's ever been. Tom Reeg : Yes, Steve. So to be 100% clear, we have no asset sale processes of actual casinos ongoing as we speak. But to your point, if I just break the year into the 90 days between these conference calls, the biggest change that I've seen in the last 90 days is the amount of incoming activity you've got from people calling us up and saying, what do you think about this asset, what do you think about that asset? And as you know, we're economic animals. So if it ultimately makes sense that the best way to drive value is we transact, that's a possibility. But again, there's nothing active ongoing, but there is a whole lot more inbound activity post the first Fed move. Steven Wieczynski : Okay. Got you. That's perfect. Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David Katz : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for working me in. I wanted to just double back on kind of the Danville transition, right, and just make sure we have the cadence right for the next couple of quarters in general terms. If you could just talk about if we're pulling out the temporary facility, which is, to your point, is highly productive, and starting off with a new permanent facility. Should we be thinking about maybe some EBITDA dislocation for a quarter or two or three or more while that new property ramps, or is it really just more of a margin conversation? Tom Reeg : Yes, it's the latter, David. So we have a tent that right now sits in a parking lot of the permanent. That tent will operate until the moment that we open the permanent. So it's pretty seamless. There isn't a -- you shut it down and you go through testing, that sort of thing, you do all that while the temporary is still open. So it should just be as if the temporary just became dramatically larger from one day to the next. And if I were -- in terms of how you would model it, I would say you probably consider the -- view it as if the temporary is opening or is operating until the middle of December and you get a couple of weeks this year from the permanent. That probably shifts a few days in either direction, but that's a good thing. Anthony Carano : And David, this is Anthony. We're really excited because it opens up a whole another segment of our database on that Eastern Seaboard, someone that may not come and just travel for the day, but we're going to have a beautiful new 340-room hotel, great restaurants with some celebrity chefs. And so it attracts a whole new clientele that may not be coming to the temporary facility today as well. David Katz : Got it. I've been to see it. And just quickly with respect to Vegas and any competitive or promotional changes, anything going on in the marketplace that we should be aware of, or is the promotional environment kind of status quo? Tom Reeg : I would say the market has been remarkably stable. I know there's been, the mania on the investment side of things are changing rapidly in the wrong direction that we're not seeing -- we are seeing zero evidence of that on the ground. The business has been -- you're running in the high-90s. Occupancy rates a little better as you move to Group business, Group business helps your non-gaming grow and then it's a matter of how did you do in the table business versus last year. That's a good setup for us in the first quarter. And then we've got Versailles online this year versus last year. So we don't see a big change in either direction in this business as we sit out here today. David Katz : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Barry Jonas with Truist Securities. Barry Jonas : Hi, guys. For digital, can you give us an update on some of the key functionalities you're working on, maybe like shared wallet to help bridge any product gaps with the market leaders? Thanks. Eric Hession : Yes. I would say the biggest one that we have right now is the shared wallet that you raised. We're currently in nine states or jurisdictions. We're rolling it out. We're trying to do a little bit more than one a month. And so we're targeting kind of the midpoint of next year before we're completely switched over to our own PAM. But currently, if you're in any of those nine states and you go to another state that's the same on the PAM, then it will automatically have your wallet shared. So it's just not connected to Nevada and some of the other key states right now, but that's progressing very well. In terms of the efforts that we've had to improve our parlay mix, this quarter on a year-over-year basis, our parlay mix grew the fastest that it's grown and it's hit an all-time high. And then you see the results in the hold percentage. So we're pleased with that. There are still some products that we're missing. A lot of the live same-game parlay on some of the non-main markets, our products still lacks the -- what some of the others offer. But overall, I feel like we've made a lot of progress in the last year and really close the gap. And so -- and I think you can see that in the fact that we're able to reinvest at much lower levels and still retain the customers. Barry Jonas : Great. Thanks, Eric. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Tom, I want to go back to just the regional outlook for a second. If we think about some of the puts and takes, obviously, a lot more tailwinds as we turn the page, but there's still some of this competitive stuff that's popping up. And obviously, I think we're familiar with your formula, which is being quite disciplined on how you react when those -- when that competition comes into the market. So the question is, as we put through the puts and takes and I'm keeping an eye on like South suburbs and Chicago in particular, as we see still some incremental headwinds from places like that, are we in a place where you feel really confident that regional gaming grows next year? Do we end up flat? I mean, obviously, the headwind is going to be a lot less, but there still seems like there's going to be some. So just if you could help us think about that high-level. Tom Reeg : Yes, there are still -- there's still more headwinds than tailwinds for us. I think you're looking at a year that's down slightly to flat as my regional expectation for next year. You've got the Poarch Creek product that opens November 11. Yes. So in a couple of weeks in the Chicago market will be impactful to both Jolie Ed and Hammond. We do have the opportunity -- so as these properties open, our philosophy is you don't really get in the way of the trial from your customers. Your customers are going to go try the new product regardless of what you do. But in a number of these properties, you're looking at, they've been operating for a few quarters now and now we can go back into those battlegrounds and fight for those customers. And that's really the swing factor in terms of does '25 end up being a growth year for regional or not is the effectiveness of our ability to fight in those markets like in Indiana and Chicago and Mississippi and Iowa that have already been impacted by competition. So we haven't anniversaried a lot of those, there are some that go continue well into '25, but it should be a much different picture in '25 for us than it was in '24. Shaun Kelley : Understood. Thank you for that. And then just a question sort of high-level on the legal side actually as it relates to sports-betting. Obviously, you talked about some of the possible expenses or expenses related to Missouri. And I think some people have been watching that market. And just wondering how -- just big picture as a company, how Caesars is looking today at the expansion of OSB broadly? Have you kind of changed a little bit in your outlook for the OSB pros and cons? And sort of how do you think about that versus iGaming? Are those separate or overall, you're taking a little bit of a new course as it relates to digital expansion from here? Tom Reeg : We'd like to see OSB and iGaming in every jurisdiction of the United States. We think it's important that it's done in a manner that makes sense for the operators and for the state. And you've got a well-established path of legalizing and licensing through the operators that have invested substantial amounts of capital, employed thousands of people, and paid hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in taxes. We think it's important that it continues on that path. But we would like to see OSB and iGaming in every jurisdiction that we possibly can. Shaun Kelley : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Grambling : Hi, thank you. As you've seen the handle share improving in iGaming and more engagement, are you seeing any change in the types of customers playing as we think about either new customers to the entire system cross-sell from OSB and/or overlap with brick-and-mortar? Eric Hession : I would say that the -- on the iCasino side, the main shift that we've seen is on the -- with the introduction of the Caesars Palace Online standalone app, we've seen a lot more slot players move over. And we are seeing more crossover between the brick-and-mortar and that app as you'd expect. I do think there's a lot more opportunity there. However, we're really becoming more-and-more integrated into the brick-and-mortar process through the host, through the PD teams, through the marketing activities that go on at the properties. So we're optimistic that the percentage of crossover will continue to grow. And then we know of course, that the customers that play with us on brick-and-mortar and also play with us online, we get a much higher percentage of their wallet and it gets consolidated to us. And so as a result, we see a higher-value from those customers. Stephen Grambling : And as a follow-up, this may be an opportunity for Tom to pull a lot of the earlier questions together, but in the past, I think you had walked from, call it, $4 billion to $5 billion in EBITDA with a couple of building blocks. How would you characterize that walk now thinking through all the puts and takes from dispositions, new assets, some of the trends and then the path on digital? Tom Reeg : Yes. So, Shaun, we're -- I don't know what -- this is a number of quarters in a row where we're in the neighborhood of $1 billion of EBITDA. So call it a $4 billion enterprise with very little contribution from digital to date in terms of EBITDA, but inflecting as we speak, and obviously just posted a couple of good quarters in a row. So I think that going to 500 and beyond is still the same kind of roadmap we've talked about now for three-plus years. The brick-and-mortar side, we see returns from the investments in regional continued growth in Las Vegas that gets us hundreds of millions of incremental EBITDA if you're looking out over the next couple of years. So that gets you to the right side of that $4 billion to $5 billion range seems in our minds to still be a very clear path that we're headed down. So it was -- it's an enormous -- it was an enormous task to integrate the Caesars acquisition to stand up a digital business and to complete these major project spends and we're toward the backside of each. And you're going to see that roll through the way EBITDA and free cash flow can work in this business as we move forward. So we think the future is very bright here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DeCree with CBRE. John DeCree : Hi, guys. Two questions. Tom, you just spoke a question or two ago briefly about your thoughts on legalization of Online Sports Betting and iGaming, but I wanted to ask specifically about Florida, if you've had any discussions, or if you think there's an inroad there. I think a lawsuit against the Tribe has recently been settled. And so it looks like the path for you guys might be partnering with the Tribe. So curious if the size of that market, if you've had any meaningful discussion or a view on whether you might be able to enter Florida anytime soon? Tom Reeg : Yes. I would say, John, I'm not as optimistic that we or any of the other non-seminal entities will enter Florida soon. I saw the same remarks or heard the same remarks from Jim Allen that you did a G2E that kind of cracked open the door, but I don't think that happens in the near term. John DeCree : Thanks, Tom. I appreciated that. And one, maybe housekeeping on CapEx, Tom, maybe for you or Bret. So obviously, CapEx is stepping down next year, but curious if you could give us kind of an update on what steady-state CapEx should be for you guys maintenance and if there's any routine kind of project CapEx that you're thinking about. So as we look beyond '26 and you look at the capital product budget, do we expect CapEx to kind of keep shrinking after '25, or does it kind of level-off at a certain point? Bret Yunker : 400 area of maintenance CapEx is a good number and $200 million to $250 million of growth in other CapEx is a steady state going forward. John DeCree : Great. Thanks, Bret. Appreciate it. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Chad Beynon : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, on your business, the iGaming business, the flow through 57% this quarter was ahead of that targeted 50% and as a result of better revenue growth, obviously, the EBITDA came in ahead of expectations. So I know that you have a lot of things rolling off in '25, so maybe flow through isn't the right way to think about it. But can you maybe help us just more in the near term if hold is normal? Should this 50% still make sense, maybe absent some of the bigger roll-offs of expenses? Just trying to figure out how this ramps maybe over the next four to eight quarters here. Thanks. Eric Hession : Yes. I think when we provided that rough expectation that we should be able to flow through at 50%, it was pretty broad-based and overtime. So there are certain factors that are going to contribute to that this year that aren't going to be there next year and there are some next year that we aren't experiencing this year. In a quarter like this where we had record iCasino growth and then extremely strong sports growth, we were able to achieve better than the 50% target. As I mentioned, I think on the last call, I would expect it to bounce around a little bit, sometimes it will be a little lower and sometimes a little higher, but we still think the 50% is a reasonable expectation for the flow through on the incremental revenue for certainly next year. And then as we head into '26, we get additional roll-offs of some of the marketing. So I would expect it to continue at that level as well. Chad Beynon : Okay. Perfect. And then on the Regional side, if you're able to somehow split out or separate the competition, weather, et cetera from just normal consumer business. Did you see any more deterioration in that lowest tier in the unrated part of the business in your Regional segment in Q3? Tom Reeg : I wouldn't say we saw more deterioration. There is a segment of the customer base that's been challenged by where pricing has gone in recent history and that's remain the case. I don't see anything alarming in the Regional business. I think most of what we're seeing is competitive impact from -- you're talking about substantial properties that have opened in multiple markets and we've lacked the -- once we lapped the opening of the temporary in Virginia, we've lacked tailwinds behind us and that started to change last week with New Orleans. Chad Beynon : Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Bender with Citizens JMP. Jordan Bender : Good afternoon, everyone. You've given a lot of good info on the Online segment. But as we think through and broad strokes, the 30% online revenue growth that you've talked about in the last couple of quarters, can you maybe help us understand how much of that is coming from just pure player growth versus maybe expanding your ARPU? And then the second part of that is, how much dry powder do you think you have left in the omnichannel that's going to help you grow iGaming revenue next year and in '26? Thank you. Eric Hession : Yes. I think you have to look at the two kind of lines separately, the Casino and the Sportsbook. The Casino business is growing users and daily actives at a very rapid pace. So Tom referenced, we measure things in month-over-month performance and our users continue to grow, our actives continue to grow, the volume continues to grow. And then as we're seeing the hold ticks up a bit. So that business is very consistent and very strong. On the Sports side, it's a little bit different. As you've seen, the volumes are somewhat flat right now. That's due to some reductions in very high-end wagers that we were getting. Last year that didn't translate into profitability. And then through the segmented marketing that I talked about as well, we're seeing some lower-end unprofitable customers not returning. And so what we are seeing though is many more bets per user. The average bet size is coming down as you'd expect. And as a result, the volumes are flat or so, but they're being more than made up by the improvement in the hold percentage. So from our standpoint, they're very different behaviors. The average worth of the customer on the Sports side is going up significantly as the volume stays the same and the hold improves. Jordan Bender : Great. And then just on the follow-up. In the Regional segment, if I look at your hotel revenue, is it fair to assume that some of that underperformance is just New Orleans and we should expect you to recoup that next year? Tom Reeg : Yes. Jordan Bender : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Guglielmo with Capital One Securities. Daniel Guglielmo : Hello, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. You all mentioned tailwinds related to the renovations at the Las Vegas and New Orleans properties and peers have had some success with renovation projects as well. Are there any other renovation growth projects that you all are eyeing within the Casino portfolio? Tom Reeg : The most substantial one that we have ongoing is Harveys Lake Tahoe. That's a multiyear $160 million project that's already begun. We opened the Wolf restaurant with Lisa Vanderpump up there this summer. We're redoing the entire casino floor. We're doing a room tower. We're doing the suites across the street kind of leaning into that property being on Lake Tahoe and you can't replicate that. What we've got there given its location on the lake and where regulations are now. So that's a substantial EBITDA producer for us that we're -- that we see significant return on that investment. That's the biggest one. There's always across the street from Caesars at Flamingo, we've got -- we've got the Vanderpump's Pinky's opens in a couple of weeks as does Gordon Ramsay Burger, that was front the strip. Within Caesars, we will have opened our high-limit slots area in a -- completely redesigned in a couple of weeks, high-limit table -- another high-limit table area will open before the end of the year. So we're always doing projects that will move the needle for us, but they're far less substantial than from a dollar spent standpoint than what we've had in the last four years since we closed. Daniel Guglielmo : Great. And that's really helpful color there. And then just quick on the Las Vegas segment. Slot handle was stronger than we expected, but table game drop was softer. Can you just talk about -- was there anything you saw there that this quarter, was it a different mix of players coming into the properties or just kind of different betting behavior? Thank you. Tom Reeg : It was a handful of large players that moved their trips versus it showed up last year, last quarter, and showed up at different times this year and last year we beat them. Daniel Guglielmo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now hand the call back over to CEO, Tom Reeg for any closing remarks. Tom Reeg : All right, Andrew, thanks. Thanks, everybody. Happy holidays. Our next call is in February. We'll see you there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program and you may now disconnect.",
