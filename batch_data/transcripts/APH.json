[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin. Diana Reardon : Thank you. My name's Diana Reardon, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call 2014. Q1 results were released this morning. I'll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.246 billion and EPS of $0.99 before one-time items, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies compared to Q1 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding those acquisition and translation impacts, sales in Q1 2014 were up 7% over last year. Sequentially, sales were flat in U.S. dollars and down 5% organically from Q4 of 2013.  Breaking down our sales into the two major components, our cable business which comprised 7% of our sales, was up 4% from last year. Our interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up a strong 16% from last year resulting from the dual benefit of good organic growth and the impact of our acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.  Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased $234 million from $207 million last year. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was in line with our guidance at 18.8%, down about 40 basis points from last year. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the advanced sensor business acquired in December of 2013.  As discussed on our last call, this acquisition is accretive on an earnings-per-share basis, so it [ph] reduces the company\u2019s overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We\u2019re very excited about the potential of the acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and Amphenol\u2019s strong operating discipline.  From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment margins were 12.2% equal to last quarter and down from 13.8% last year, primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21%, down from 21.4% last year. The year-over-year interconnect operating margin decline reflects the acquisition impact I just discussed.  We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement and continue to believe that the company\u2019s entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment. Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remained fully committed to driving enhanced performance.  As we indicated in our January earnings call and as is required under US GAAP, the company has recorded a one-time acquisition related charge of $2 million or $0.01 per share in Q1 of 2014 relating to the amortization of the value associated with acquired [ph] backlog for the Q4 2013 acquisition.  Our interest expense for the quarter was $19.1 million compared to $15.5 million last year. The increase over last year is due primarily to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback program.  Other income was $4.1 million in the quarter, up from $2.8million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, was 26.5% in Q1 2014 and approximately 26.8% in Q1 2013.  On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.4% this quarter compared to 21% in last year\u2019s quarter. As previously disclosed, Q1 2013 tax provision included income tax benefits of approximately $11 million or $0.07 per share resulting from the delay by the US government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012. Such tax provisions were reinstated in early 2013 and under US GAAP related benefit to the company was reported at that time.  Net income, excluding onetime items, was approximately 13% of sales in the quarter and earnings per share, excluding one-time items, increased a strong 14% to $0.99, up from $0.87 last year. On an as reported basis, earnings-per-share was $0.98 and $0.94 in the first quarter of 2014 and \u201913 respectively and included the one-time items previously discussed relating to acquisition charges in 2014 and income tax benefits in 2013. Bookings for the quarter were strong at $1.310 billion resulting in the book to bill ratio of approximately 1.05 to 1 for the quarter. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations in the quarter was $203 million or 127% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From working capital perspective, both inventory and accounts receivable declined about 3% from year end and stood at $773 million and $972 million at the March. Accounts payable was $480 million at the end of March down about 13% from year end.  Cash flow from operations of $203 million along with net proceeds for the January bond offering of $743 million, a reduction in short-term investments of $24 million and proceeds from stock option exercise of $60 million were used primarily to repay outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility of $658 million to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares of the company's common stock for $121 million to fund $54 million of net capital expenditures and $9 million of payments related to 2013 acquisition. Cash on hand increased approximately $136 million in the quarter. At the end of March, cash and short-term investments were just under $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside the US. At the end of the quarter, the company had 4.3 million shares remaining under its 10 million shares stock repurchase program which expires in January of 2015. And as we previously announced in January of this year, the company completed a 750 million, 5 year senior note offering. The notes were issued at 99.846% of their face value and have an interest rate of 2.55%. The company incurred fees of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the sale.  Debt at the end of March was $2.2 billion and net debt was approximately $924 million. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $270 million and $1.2 billion respectively. The company\u2019s leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.9 and 17 times respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $286 million. From a financial perspective, it was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. R. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Diana and I'd like to offer also my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. As is customary, I'm going to spend some time to highlight our achievements in the first quarter. I will then discuss our trends and the progress across our various served markets and then finally I will make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full-year of 2014, and we will certainly leave some time at the end for question-and-answers.  So Diana just detailed, we're very pleased to report that the company exceeded the high-end of our guidance in both sales and EPS and achieved a new record in orders. Revenues in the quarter increased a very strong 15% from prior year and equaled our fourth quarter record sales level of $1.246 billion.  Orders achieved this new record $1.310 billion which represents a book to bill of 1.05 to 1 and certainly bolsters our confidence for the future. And once again we generated industry-leading operating margins with first quarter return on sales of 18.8%. These results once again make me extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our agile and entrepreneurial organization continues to react quickly to capitalize on the many dynamic opportunities for growth and strong operating performance that are rising across the ever-changing landscape of electronics industry.  Before I turn to the specific markets, I just want to say that our management team\u2019s ongoing drive for diversification across the many end markets of the electronic industry has again created significant value for the company in the first quarter. In fact, we are truly proud of this great balance across our various end markets which expose us to every corner of the electronics industry while certainly insulating us from the risk of overexposure to any given market. Turning first to the military market, our sales in that market represented 11% of total Amphenol in the quarter. As we had expected, sales were down slightly from prior year and were essentially flat to prior quarter as stronger sales of our products incorporated into military airframe as well as engine were offset by a general moderation of purchasing activities by defense equipment manufacturers.  While there continue to be many uncertainties in the military spending plans of governments around the world, we are encouraged to see increasing indication of firming demand in this market. In particular, our customers are making continued investments in new electronic functionalities and military equipment and we are capitalizing on opportunities for growth that we see in certain developed geographies.  We expect demand in the military market to increase from these levels in the second quarter and we continue to expect moderate growth for the full-year of 2014. Importantly, regardless of overall spending pattern, we believe our technology leadership and broad program participation positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware.  Turning to the commercial aerospace market, this market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 4% sequentially, as aircraft manufacturers continue to raise their production levels of new airliners on which we have increased content. And as we benefitted as well from the sales contribution from last year\u2019s successful acquisition of Ionix. We remain very encouraged by our expanding presence in what is clearly a fast-growing commercial aerospace market and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the proliferation of electronics content on next-generation planes. In particular, these advanced electronics systems are requiring new higher technology interconnect solution to enhance fuel efficiency and improve passenger experience all of which creates excellent opportunities for Amphenol. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase further in the second quarter as production levels for existing and new aircraft continue to climb and remain optimistic for our overall growth prospects in the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to this very important market increased a significant 47% from prior year, as a result of contributions from the advanced sensor\u2019s acquisition as well as due to strong performance in the rail mass transit, instrumentation, heavy equipment and medical segments. Organically sales grew a very strong 11%. Sequentially our sales increased by 24% primarily related to the addition of advanced sensors in late December. We're very encouraged by our broad-based growth in the industrial market and it is really a clear confirmation of the company's progress in increasing our market penetration while also broadening our technology offering for the industrial market.  In addition, we are very excited by the future opportunities for cross-selling of sensors and interconnect products used to protect against harsh environment and to ensure high reliability, in particular in heavy equipment, medical and construction applications.  Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect further growth as we increase our penetration of new sensor and interconnect technologies across a wide array of exciting industrial segments. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased a very strong 47% from prior year and 23% sequentially as we benefited from the diverse range of new automotive products provided by Advanced Sensors and Tecvox.  We achieved strong 24% year-over-year organic growth driven by accelerating sales of our new products used in infotainment, emissions management and drive train control among another applications.  We\u2019re very excited to see the result of our expansion into these and other new high-technology automotive applications, as the benefits of our recent acquisitions combined with our long term organic product development efforts to create exciting new platforms of growth.  Automakers continue to incorporate advanced interconnect and sensor products into their electronic system in new areas of performance management, fuel-efficiency and passenger comfort and infotainment, all of which are creating great opportunities for Amphenol in this important market.  In fact, over the last five years, these trends have enabled the company to expand the automotive market from 6% of our total sales to 15% in this latest quarter. This is just an excellent example of our \u2013 of the Amphenol organization really reacting to expanding high-value opportunities that can arise with advances and changes in electronics technology.  We expect sales in the automotive market to increase further in the second quarter as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions as well as from the ongoing expansion of vehicle production and electronic content. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly from prior year and declined sequentially as we had expected by about 29%.  As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our sales of products incorporated into tablets moderated in the second half of 2013, as a result of the reduced content opportunity in certain Wi-Fi only and white box tablet devices, a dynamic which continues into 2014. Nevertheless we were encouraged to have experienced growth in the quarter in sales related to new high-performance smartphones and laptops which partially offset the slowdown in tablet sales.  In the second quarter, we expect some further moderation of demand as our OEM customers prepare for new product releases that are planned really for the second half of 2014. And while we continue to expect sales this year to be down in the mid-single digit range due to the dynamics we\u2019ve already discussed, we do look forward to a step up in sales in the second half of 2014, as we benefit from our strong technology position on a range of new devices. In addition, our highly agile organization remains poised to react to and capitalize upon any incremental growth opportunities that may materialize throughout the year.  The mobile networks market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and this is the market where we are very pleased to grow sales by a very strong 19% both from prior year as well as sequentially from prior quarter. In the first quarter we were able to react quickly to a pickup in demand from both base-station manufacturers as well as mobile operators.  While our year-over-year growth was particularly significant in Asia we actually grew strongly in all regions on a sequential basis. Based on our latest feedback from our mobile network customers we now have a more positive view of this market for 2014. As operators in many geographies have increased their spending on LTE and other next-generation networks, in order to accommodate higher data speeds and to relieve the gaps in coverage and capacity which exists across many wireless systems.  We are really encouraged now that the pent-up demand that we have talked about for quite some time for investment in mobile infrastructure is really now beginning to materialize. Based on this new outlook we now anticipate further sequential growth in the second quarter and expect our sales growth for the full-year to accelerate from the rate of prior year. In general, we look forward to further long-term strength driven by our broad design and position on a wide array of base station platforms as well as by our growing position with a diverse range of global wireless operators.  The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased in this market 6% from prior year which is really led by growth in our products that are incorporated into servers and storage equipment in particular. Sequentially sales declined as we had expected by 8% due to the normal first quarter seasonality that we see in the IT market. As our customers continue to strive for new levels of equipment performance in order to handle what is clearly a dramatic expansion of data traffic I can tell you that our pipeline of new design opportunities with our next-generation products has continued to strengthen. In addition we are accelerating our efforts at working directly with data center operators and IT service providers in addition to our traditional OEM customers. This is actually very important as demand patterns in the IT market are shifting with certain of such end customers increasingly developing tailor-made solutions to their interconnect architecture.  Looking towards the second quarter, while we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels in the seasonally lower first half we do remain confident that our technology position will enable Amphenol to continue to perform well into the future.  The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were essentially flat to prior year and prior quarter as increased demand by international cable operators was offset by a moderation in cable spending by customers in the US. While the market environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenging and competitive pricing environment in particular remains difficult as Diana mentioned, we are encouraged to see the emerging benefits of our product and our customer diversification, both which have enabled us to grow a range of broadband customers while offering a more complete interconnect product offering. Going into the second quarter, we expect our sales in the broadband market to increase from these levels and look forward to continuing our strong position in the broadband market.  So in summary, I can just tell you that I am extremely proud of our organization, we continue to execute well in what is no doubt still a challenging and certainly dynamic market environment. Our superior performance once again is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a very diverse and balanced range of markets, the worldwide presence really Amphenol being in all corners of the world, the lean and flexible cost structure and most importantly an agile and entrepreneurial management team, one that is poised all the time to react to opportunities and to certainly deal with any challenges that may come our way. Turning to the outlook, and based on constant exchange rate as well as normal seasonal pattern and in consideration of our strong first quarter performance as well as our current expectations for the remainder of the year, we're not increasing our guidance and expect in the second quarter and full-year 2014 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.285 billion and 5.110 billion to 5.2 billion respectively.  For EPS, we expect in the first quarter in the range of $1.03 to $1.06 and for the full-year $4.25 to $4.34 respectively. For the full-year this new guidance now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 11% to 13% and 10% to 13% respectively. Our entire team is very encouraged by the strengthening outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics in the global economy. The ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create for Amphenol tremendous opportunities and I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability and thereby ultimately to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol.  Thank you very much and operator at this time we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question Wamsi Mohan, Merrill Lynch, your line is open. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, on the guidance just wondering if there are any specific reasons for the sub-seasonal guide that's implying below what you guys have done historically? So just wanted to get some color on if you saw some particular trends that you might want to highlight aside from the ones you spoke about? R. Adam Norwitt : No, look, I think it\u2019s actually very strong guidance Wamsi, I haven't gone back and done a historical analysis of every Q2 compared to Q1, we think that this is actually quite strong guidance. I think that if you look at the beat that we had in the first quarter where we had expected the first quarter to be more things [ph] definitely down, I think this is an outstanding guidance that we have here for the second quarter and for the full year and we feel very good about it. That\u2019s about how I would really say. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : And Diana, a quick question on CapEx. Why are we seeing CapEx increasing so much versus last year? It was only $30 million last year and now it's $54 million, and $50 million-ish last quarter too. Anything that is changing that is driving the higher CapEx levels? Diana Reardon : Sure, in the near term here Wamsi, if you recall we had this flood back in 2011 in upstate New York and we are, I think as we had mentioned in the past replacing and resulting that manufacturing facility at a much higher piece of land, I would note, so there is some incremental spending that you see in Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year and then you also see some I think in Q2 as we complete the majority of the construction there. I think that the CapEx last year was about 3.5% of sales, I think it will be about 3.5% this year, so it's really \u2013 it\u2019s kind of still within our historical range but you are right that those two quarters have been somewhat spiky as will Q1 and then I would expect it to kind of go back down to somewhere 3% of sales, or so the spike really relates to the funding of the replacement of that manufacturing facility. Operator : Next question, : Jim Suva, Citi, your line is open. Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I had two questions. The first question is when we think about the integration of the Advanced Sensor business, that's a very attractive market, what is Amphenol doing as far as its efforts to increase the profitability of it? I think you were pretty clear on the prepared remarks it had the ability to be more profitable and contribute a lot more to Amphenol. Is it like raw material procurement, is it sharing of R&D, is it moving to low-cost consolidating plants, are you in similar locations? What are you kind of doing to help out with those margins because it sounds like you have a lot of confidence in visibility that is going to happen. If you can help us to understand that.  And then the second question is given the changes in the global raw material environment can you help us understand is that impacting your pricing some, is it helping your margins some, how should we think about the changes in raw materials and what your customers are giving feedback to you at Amphenol? Thank you. Diana Reardon : Jim, I would, just maybe talk about the second question first and then Adam can talk about Advanced Sensors. I think that certainly the environment relative to raw materials is a better environmental than what we had seen in a a while back, I think that as you know very well one individual item by itself isn\u2019t necessarily the answer relative to gross margin trends, it\u2019s really the balance between pricing dynamics in the market and input costs on a combined basis. And what I would say I think that we certainly like this environment better than environment we had a few years back, we really don't necessarily see it as a headwind, I mean as a tailwind from profitability perspective. I would also just point out that if you look at the guidance that we\u2019ve just given in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and you look at the sequential conversion margins that are incorporated and reflected in that guidance, they are quite strong, they are actually above our target of 25% which we have for the company. So I think the guidance that we\u2019ve given on profitability and how that profitability is going to trend, during 2014, off this new base level that we have established in the first quarter is really quite strong and I think it\u2019s fully reflective of all of the opportunities that we do see which would include perhaps in certain specific product areas of the business where there may be some small help from the prices [ph]. R. Adam Norwitt : Yeah relative to advance sensors, let me just say generally first that we are extremely happy with the acquisition so far. We have owned it just a few days over four months now. And as we have always said what is our first criteria for an acquisition, it\u2019s people and it\u2019s technology and we feel so good about both of those aspects of this company, now that we get to know them certainly more intimately than one does during the process of an acquisition. So from that standpoint the early return and our early impressions of the business are just fantastic. We have also great feedback from customers, together with the advanced sensors expertise across the sensor element and the new technology. And we still believe with a lot of conviction that that that will be through and we still remain very excited about being part of this new growth platform for the company.  Relative to the profitability we certainly talked about and Diana mentioned also in her remarks that this is a company that did come in at a somewhat lower level of profitability in which we have a conviction that over time we will get that up to the level of profitability of Amphenol. How does that happen? It starts really with a mindset, it\u2019s not bringing in people and kind of consultants and things like this, it starts really with the mindset of management to take pride in their products and then to execute on those product opportunities and on the production in a way that is lean and able to really make money. I mean ultimately we talked about profit is just selling price minus cost and so we will work really on both sides of selling of pricing for pride of the product and doing that in a cost-effective way. Diana has also mentioned and those of the company, those are all areas that the management team is looking at and it is really that management team, the existing management team in whom we have so much confidence, who is going to drive those things, are they going to be a consolidation with Amphenol, so it\u2019s sort of traditional synergies that maybe companies in many industries could talk about, you know that, that\u2019s really the way that we approach acquisition. We believe that there's tremendous value inside of this company, think that they have a fantastic technology and great people and no doubt about it we\u2019re working intimately with them to find ways to extract even more volume from the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question Sherri Scribner, Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Diana, I just wanted to ask, and Adam also, about the strength that you are expecting in the second half. If you look at the full-year guidance you took the range up to the higher end of that guidance and you seem to be very confident. I know that you mentioned the mobile devices business is part of the upside you expect in the second but wanted to get more detail and understand if there is some other pieces of the business that you think are going to see some upside in the second half. Thanks. Diana Reardon : Sure I think from a market standpoint it's really \u2013 in the first case some of those same markets that Adam talked about that we\u2019re strong, being strong for the full year and then being strong for Q1. I think the one other difference that we do expect in the second half which Adam mentioned is we do expect sort of a second half lift to some extent in the mobile device market based on the knowledge that, we have based on our operating in discussions with customers and so forth. There are more new product ramps that are expected in the second half, the Q3 and also Q4 from sequential improvement standpoint in that market does have some impact when you look at the full consolidated results on a first half second half basis. Sherri Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, so it sounds like it is primarily mobile devices and then just general strength overall. Maybe can I also ask about the mobile network piece of the business. You guys finally are a bit more confident that that is improving. Can we get a little bit more detail on what you are seeing there? I know you mentioned LTE and next-generation buildouts, but maybe a little more detail on that would be helpful and if you think that is also part of the second-half recovery. Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much. No, we\u2019re actually very pleased with the performance of the mobile networks market this quarter. it\u2019s been, last year we were pleased to finally see growth for the first time in I think the better part of three if not even four years in that market and we grew kind of mid single digits, I think 5% growth last year and we were very pleased to see that growth accelerating here in the first quarter. And as I said at the time of our fourth quarter call that we are cautious always at the outlook in that market because there can be volatility but at the same time we have done a great job over the recent three or four years to position ourselves, very strongly such that if the spending cycle would really kind of let loose to some extent, we would benefit from that, and I think right now what we are seeing in many geographies is that the operators are now finally figuring out how to charge for data and as they figure out how to charge for data, it allows them then to make the investments in the networks that are appropriate to make given this incredible proliferation of high data consumption devices that has been a dynamic that we have all been experiencing for the last half of a decade. So I think that economics of the market starts to work its way out and thereby embolden the service providers ultimately, will have to make investment decisions to make appropriate investment decision. And we are also very fortunate that in this market we have such a broad presence at the OEM really not leveraged to any OEMs, so whoever wins we are pretty agnostic to that, and at the same time we understand that more and more of the interconnect and the antenna get specified and decided directly by mobile operators on a worldwide basis and so we find ourselves in a very unique position of having those \u2013 that great channel directly to the operators together with the preferred supplier relationships across the board with OEMs wherever they may be. And I think in the quarter we really started to reap the benefits from that position together with \u2013 those favorable economics finally allowing operators to spend money. As I talked about we saw great growth in Asia and certainly the LTE build out in China has not been insignificant benefits but we saw strong really in every geography on a sequential basis, and that was something that traditionally you don't see in this market and of all the signs that make one feel a little more positive about the spending environment that that's one that I would really latch onto, because normally these markets work in kind of countercyclical fashion, there's sort of so much that goes on across the world and Asia builds a lot, North America doesn\u2019t build and vice versa. But in this case we really saw strong performance across the globe and I think of all the things that give me and us \u2013 and our team really the most confidence. Operator : Our next question from Shawn Harrison, Longbow Research. Shawn Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research : Two questions. The first is on the IT datacom business. It sounds from your comments, Adam, that market is slowing a bit and I know you guys have outperformed the market in 2012 and 2013. Maybe you could just comment on where you think growth rates are going over the next 12 to 18 months. And then the second question is just tied to liquidity and cash flow. You guys I think had one of the best operating cash flow quarters for first quarter that I can remember. You've got probably about $1.5 billion of liquidity. Are there bigger deals out there that are becoming available or is it going to be a number of smaller deals, maybe just your bandwidth to handle a lot of incoming deals as well as a management team? R. Adam Norwitt : Well, look Shawn, relative to the first question IT datacom, I think we feel very good about our performance on a year over year basis in the quarter, we grew 6% in the quarter last year, you may recall we grew that marketplace 7% in a market that arguably was really down last year. And I think when you look at the OEM results and other data points it\u2019s hard to say that that was a market that was up. On a sequential basis the first quarter is usually down and the second quarter usually is also not a strong seasonal quarter in the IT market, you tend to see a little bit more in the second half. I think there are a lot of dynamics in this market and it\u2019s a market where you got to really stay on your toes. When you look at who is really making decisions, where the spending is happening, what's happening to IT budgets, it is a very delicate market in that respect where some of the traditional spending patterns are really being turned on their heads. And that\u2019s why I talked, I made some mention of the fact that if one is really just going to sell through the old channel of OEMs, as one has done for a long long time in the past that can be a very very difficult market. And I think to our credit we have worked really in a number of different areas in the IT market, so we're not just focused only on the traditional OEMs, we\u2019re working directly with data centers, we\u2019re working directly with service providers where there is some shifting really of the balance of power and the decision-making around the electronics and the configuration of those electronics. What does that mean really for the rest of the year I think if this stage it's a little hard to predict and thus I think our outlook is a very prudent outlook saying that we have this kind of flat performance in the first half followed by a second half that will be up by some amount. Ultimately what that\u2019s going to leave the IT market for the year I think it\u2019s little too early to say, we wouldn't have the conviction about that, because I think we were able to develop around the wireless infrastructure. Relative to acquisitions and certainly let Diana speak to any liquidity questions specifically but relative to acquisitions and the scale thereof, we have always had an appetite for acquisitions regardless of size, and so as we look out at the universe of companies that one day may become available, we do not apply a criteria which is size of that company, we have made acquisitions that are very small and very productive, new platforms for the company and similarly we have made very significant acquisition like the Advanced Sensors, the one that we made last quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter which was really the second largest in the history of the company. So to that extent, there are good companies that are available in the industry, that are not available \u2013 but that are out there in the industry that may one day become available really of all different sizes and I don't think that there is really change today in the nature of the size and scope of the acquisition opportunities and our pipeline for acquisition remains very strong, we remain in great dialogue with a number of good companies and as I always say, we remain wholly unable to predict when those will come, which ones will come when. But what I can tell you is when they do as they did with us [indiscernible] fourth quarter we will be poised and ready to take advantage of those opportunities. Operator : Our next question, Amit Daryanani, your line is open with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on a nice quarter. Adam, I was wondering if you would just talk about some of the initial feedback or thoughts you have on the sensor portfolio after having it under the Amphenol umbrella for the last few months now. Are you seeing better cross-selling opportunities at this point and if so where do you think the cross-selling opportunities are more attractive, is that the industrial side or the automotive side? R. Adam Norwitt : Well I mentioned earlier on \u2013 I mean we have a very positive impression, again we've only on the company, they\u2019ve only been part of our team for four months and a few days here. So it is still early but we're extremely excited but with what we have seen so far and I think in particular we are excited from a technology standpoint. They just have outstanding technology and even more outstanding individuals supporting the development of that technology. So the interaction that happens and has happened really early on have been kind of our engineers to their engineers and I think I stayed there probably for the last time because they are just like our other engineers are. And I think we have seen good opportunities and I would say we have seen them across both of the end markets that you describe, obviously within the industrial market that\u2019s a lot of sub markets, everything from medical to heavy equipment, construction and many many other segments, and as well as in the automotive market, I think one of the premises, one of several premises that we had with this acquisition was that there is a value in the interconnect packaging of the sensor product and there\u2019s just no question about it. We do see that.  Now what does that generate in the short-term, one can never be too overconfident about changing things from a technology standpoint so quickly with customers but the early returns with those customers, the early dialogue that we are having and I personally have been involved in some of them that they are very very positive. And I'm very confident that long-term that will be a tremendous advantage that we have as we go about slowly over a long time period. You\u2019re building a new platform of growth with this sensor business. Amit Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : And I guess, Diana, when I look at the guidance that you guys have now especially with the next three quarters beyond the March 1, it looks like you are looking at convergent margins being sequentially being somewhere in the low to mid 30% range for Q2, Q3, Q4. Could you maybe just talk about what is driving this better conversion margin from the historical trend? I assume GE sensor integration has something to do with it, but maybe if you could talk about the couple of big levers that is driving that that would be helpful. Diana Reardon : Sure, I think that as you point out and I think as I said in response to another question, you are right, we get a higher conversion margin in those three quarters than our goal. I think that we have, if you go back historically especially in the Q2 kind of a timeframe had a conversion margins that were more in that range. So I think there is a combination of factors certainly, I know the sequential volume increases as we go along here with growth during the year is all factor, I think that the environment in general from a margin standpoint is probably slightly more supportive than it had been in the prior years and \u2013 that balance of pricing and cost. I think when you get into the second half of the year there is some contribution in there from some expected improvement in some of the acquisitions that have come in later in 2013, certainly not up to the average level of the company yet. But as we go through those quarters, there is some improvement that we are expecting. In addition, we have got a market or two in there that had been sort of flat to down for a few years is starting to come back. So I think in general, we\u2019ve got some positive trends in the business from an operating management standpoint, I think we\u2019ve got a high degree of confidence throughout the company in achieving these high levels of conversion margins and we actually feel pretty excited as a team to be able to now incorporate those into our guidance for the remainder of the year and really start to build back as we get into the second half of 2014 to levels, when you compare to the prior year that would be exactly where we would want them to be as a company as a whole. So those are I think the main factors Amit. Operator : Next question, Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping first you could elaborate a little bit more on the outlook in mobile devices. I understand there is some new wins. If you could help us understand what sorts of products those are in, if it's antennas or connector products. And then maybe related to that if you could talk about what the opportunity is in the consumer wearables market? R. Adam Norwitt : Well, Mark, thank you very much for the question. As I discussed, our outlook at this stage for the mobile device market would certainly be to have in the second half to pick up based largely on on some new programs, a wide number of new programs and as you can imagine I am not going to talk specifically about anything at this stage but let be said these new programs are really broad across the broad range of applications that we participate in and we participate in everything from smartphones to ultrabook to mobile computing devices which include things tablets and E-readers. So I am not going to comment about others specific but really not prudent given interaction with customers and the various confidentialities that there is. Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And then for my follow-up question, I was hoping to talk a little bit more on the Advanced Sensors business and really centers more broadly if you could talk about what you think the potential growth rate of that business is in terms of revenue growth? And then if there are other parts of the sensor market you'd like to expand in be it consumer or other types of the sensor end markets. R. Adam Norwitt : Look, I think as I have said we believe that this acquisition which is big for Amphenol but really small given the overall size of the broad sensor market, it is very exciting for us. I mean if you look at the broad sensor market what is the real number for it, but we\u2019ve heard numbers in the range of kind of $50 billion in size, roughly the same as the market for connectors and with our $225 million in sales, that puts us in a certainly small, for us significant but a small on a relative basis. So where is the growth going to come from for us, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunities for growth and is that going to be in what markets. Today we are stronger with the Advanced Sensors business in the industrial and automotive markets, we think there are tremendous opportunities for growth in those markets. One can imagine that we would be very interested in pursuing other markets where high reliability, harsh environment, the packaging of the products would be part of a very compelling sales proposition to customers. Are we going to end up getting into consumer sensors and other things? I think that would \u2013 that's not something that necessarily would be at the top of our list and it certainly wouldn't be for us a high priority at this stage but I am not going to close any doors long-term. We will see, we're still learning about the sensor market, it is a very exciting market and it\u2019s a market where I think I've mentioned before what excites us so much about it is the makeup of that market just reminds us so much of the connector market, took [ph] 15 or so years ago a market where you have just tremendous diversification, a market where you have you tremendous technology innovation, where you're making a product which ultimately as a small component in a broader more complex system but it\u2019s a component that is very critical whereby if that fails, things don\u2019t work in the overall system and thus you can embed inside that product in outstanding degrees of technology which ultimately allow you to realize strong returns and the kind of returns that we want to make as a company. Ultimately what\u2019s the growth rate going to be of that business, we wouldn\u2019t have bothered if we thought it wasn't going to grow and we have certainly strong targets of our own growth. We are achieving strong growth today and we don\u2019t hold any operation or division in Amphenol to a lower standard than we hold collectively to ourselves. So we would certainly expect and drive that organization to grow at least as fast as we can grow as a company and then long-term we look to grow organically, we look to grow inorganically, through acquisition. And we're going to be very opportunistic and very \u2013 on one side and very methodical on the other side to really get to know the market from our position of strength and expand ourselves. Just again \u2013 just as we have done in the interconnect market for the last decade and a half. And I think\u2026 that\u2019s the real opportunity across Advanced Sensors business long term. Operator : Our next question, Amitabh Passi, UBS. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS : Adam, I guess first question for you was book-to-bill, 1.05, most of your commentary on most of the end markets is quite constructive going to the second quarter yet you expressed a level of caution in the macro environment. I just wanted to see if you can flesh it out a bit more. Did you see or are you still seeing a lot of volatility order, week to week, in terms of incoming orders? Did things soften as the quarter progressed? Just any incremental insight in terms of why the sort of hesitation and the caution still. R. Adam Norwitt : Look, I think that we \u2013 first of all, to answer your question about the quarter, the quarter progressed actually very nicely throughout the quarter, there wasn't any incremental weakening, the end of the quarter was strong, the beginning of the quarter was strong and February included the Chinese new year, so you can imagine that you have a little bit of done well [ph] kind of a quarter there. And I think that was not abnormal and there was certainly no change in how we finished the quarter to drive. We feel that this is actually very strong guidance and if you look at the guidance across the course of the year, as we\u2019ve talked about it certainly does strengthen throughout the year. I think when we look at the book to bill which was extremely strong I would tell you that some of the bookings come in what I would term more of our longer cycle businesses, things like industrial and aerospace And military. And those don't always convert immediately within the 90 days following the quarter in which they were booked. And so that\u2019s about maybe the only thing I would say to add little more color to the timing of the orders. But I will just tell you we feel that this is actually very strong guidance and a very strong outlook going into the rest of the year. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS : Excellent and then just as a follow-up, Diana for you, with respect to OpEx and interest expense for the second quarter, can you give us maybe just incremental insight in terms of what you are assuming in terms of how OpEx trends and interest expense? Diana Reardon : Sure, interest expense will be somewhere around 20 million or so a quarter in Q2 and Q3 and then will come down in Q4 when our notes are retired. From a SG&A or OpEx standpoint, the lift that you see in the first is really that acquisition impact that I talked about on the operating income line. So that\u2019s sort of in reset as the kind of full quarter of consolidation for the acquisitions that have somewhat higher SG&A levels as I think Adam mentioned before and I think I mentioned on the last call. As we look into the remaining quarters of the year, we would expect I guess a normal Amphenol pattern as we look to more tightly control those expenses including those of the prior companies and I would expect, as a percentage that SG&A will start to come down, it would grow into slower space than the sales growth from a sequential perspective. Operator : Our next question, Mike Wood, Macquarie. Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Research : I saw one wireless carrier offering free 4G LTE data with the Wi-Fi service. Is that a sign that you're seeing the stability in the mix between Wi-Fi only tablets and 4G tablets. Can you comment on what you have seen there? R. Adam Norwitt : I am not close enough to know what carrier and how that is. But I think that if there is one thing that is happening is that carriers are looking if at all possible to offload this tidal wave of data from their cellular networks which are quite expensive to WiFi networks which certainly have much much lower operating expenses to them and so you will see some of the major carriers in North America who are really trying at all that they can do to bundle that kind of a Wi-Fi hotspot accessibility for free together with their more mobile broadband that really has to run over the over the wireless base station. So other than that I don't know that I would have any further insight to that specific offer that you mentioned. Again, what I would just reiterate is what we are seeing is that the conviction of the carriers broadly to spend money seems to be strengthening at this time and that then translates ultimately into their willingness to spend capital on a more aggressive schedule which ultimately we can enjoy some of the benefits of and I think part of that willingness is that they are figuring out how to charge. I mean I am a perfect case study or canary in the coal mine if you will on this. I had for so many years this wonderful grandfather unlimited data plan with my carrier who I have been a phenomenal customer for, for so many years. And then I got a device and I didn't actually have the option of mobile broadband and I wanted to tether it and here they said, well, if you want to tether it, you got to give up your unlimited data plan and there I am kind of stuck between the two mills on tier [ph] to make that decision and ultimately I did give up my unlimited data plan. And I think I'm not the only one that\u2019s been going through that kind of a calculus. They are being very, very astute, I think the operators are figuring out how to migrate people off this plan and thereby start to charge for the data at the same time as they are trying very hard to move people into different means of accessing that data.  And together that is a very favorable result I think for the overall market and one which we are able to [indiscernible] Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Research : Great color on that. Now that Advanced Sensors is part of the portfolio for four months is it too early to tell or are you seeing the deal pipeline grow now that you have this larger served market? R. Adam Norwitt : I think it\u2019s early, we\u2019re not going to comment specifically about which acquisitions or pipeline in which market. But it\u2019s certainly something that long-term we will keep our eyes open for, no question about it. Our ability to acquire company is really very special advantage of Amphenol, it\u2019s a real organic advantage of the company, in fact that because of our unique organizational structure we\u2019re able to bring companies in, in a very undisruptive fashion and because of our very lean approach to acquisitions we\u2019re able to do this very, very quickly, we\u2019re able to react when the opportunities are there and that ultimately does position us really an acquirer of choice, or the acquirer of choice in the industry. And I think as we expand our platform and start looking outside of the connector towards sensors, from an acquisition standpoint, those same benefits that we bring to bear over the last decade and a half in a very successful acquisition program, we see no reason to think that those same benefits cannot also pay dividends in the potential acquisition of sensor companies. Operator : Our next question, Steven Fox, Cross Research. Steven Fox \u2013 Cross Research : Just one question from me regarding the wireless infrastructure market. Adam, you talked about how some of the sales are coming closer to the carrier's decision. Is there a way to break that down in terms of how much of the cable assemblies that you may be doing are related to that decision process? And then what does that do from a lead time standpoint or visibility into your business as a whole in terms of looking at wireless infrastructure? Thanks R. Adam Norwitt : I'd rather not talk very specifically about how much of our sales to carriers and how much to OEMs. And that\u2019s something we like to keep in our knowledge and not in the pocket of our competition. But what I can tell you is that our growth in the market is actually very balanced between the OEMs and the installation and the carrier business and some of the installation business is working directly with carriers, some of that is working with really the sales teams of the OEMs, and no question about it, the requirements when you work with a service provider as opposed to an OEM, are very different and that's true if you\u2019re talking about wireless, it is true when you talk about broadband, it's true as we see that migration happening in the IT datacom market. Carriers have very, very different requirements and very different priorities than do OEMs. I mean ultimately an OEM has a job which is to run their factories as efficiently as possible and thereby be able to solve \u2013 to be able to support their customers and it\u2019s a somewhat more predictable business that they have, that when you're running factories, they don\u2019t want to have that massive volatility in their factories.  As opposed to a carrier, oftentimes what the carriers care most about is hey, the crew is ready and able to set it up, are the parts all there on time because if it\u2019s missing one bolt or nut or clamp, the crew can climb up on the tower to put everything back together again. And so there is certainly a premium put on responsiveness and on the agility of \u2013 the lots about the agility of our organization and how we\u2019re able to adapt very quickly to the different requirements of various markets and I think this is a perfect example of that where we have organizations who have been used to that sort of, more sort of steady drumbeat interaction that you would have with an OEM, who have really retooled themselves to interact with an operator and deal with the operator on their own terms, because you can't force them to deal with you on your terms very successfully, you got to adapt, you\u2019ve got to be agile, you got to react to the realities of the market that you're trying to be successful in. And I think that we have done that. So yes, a lead time sometimes shorter, is there a little more volatility in the installation market, you don\u2019t know, they have crew of four people going to a tower and one of them calls in sick, they don\u2019t go that day, they don\u2019t need the parts, or it shows and they don\u2019t need the parts, or there is a storm [ph], they need even more. So, but that is something that we've been doing for a very, very long time in Amphenol, you know that we have had our broadband, or cable business for a very long time, that has always been the service provider business. So many of the things that we know in dealing with service providers through the broadband market, we certainly are able to use methodologies and approaches in dealing in the wireless infrastructure market. And on a more recent basis in the IT market it\u2019s the same dynamics come about. Operator : Our next question, James Kisner, Jefferies. James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company : Thanks for squeezing me in there. Just regarding the conversion margin discussion and also just the improving materials cost environment, I'm just kind of wondering knowing you guys manage to a bottom line, but might you expect to see some of that improved contribution margin to come from improvement in gross margin? We've got a couple of years here where you have not hit 32%, more closer to 31% now, might we see some improvement in gross margin? Diana Reardon : Look, I think as you pointed out in your question, we really do manage to the bottom line and it\u2019s been a very successful strategy for us. We have a very diverse business and the components of that bottom-line whether it\u2019s gross margin or SG&A do vary some depending upon the particular type of product, the market, type of technology. And so I think over time we may see some positive conversion on both lines but from our perspective the most important thing is how the conversion looks on the bottom line and I think we will continue to manage the business that way and we do so by specifically to what gross margin or what SG&A are going to do in a particular quarter. I think I said in response to the SG&A question that we would expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to come down some as we move along and sales grow during the year. And we do expect to see very strong conversion margin on the bottom line as we move through 2014 and we\u2019re certainly very excited about that, but exactly where that\u2019s come down at the end of the day we can\u2019t really say at this point and we do believe we get the best performance by making sure that all costs are managed [indiscernible] conduct ourselves and talk about it in that fashion. James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company : This is a follow-up. Are there any particular financial hurdles you guys look at in acquisitions, return on investment capital or IRR? If you can't talk numerically perhaps just give us conceptually how you evaluate it if there's any kind of actual financial criteria other than just sort of strategic opportunity for revenue synergy. Anything you can do to help us out there would be great, thanks. Diana Reardon : I mean we look at a lot of things, I think Adam talked a little bit about acquisitions earlier on the call, I think we look to pay a fair price for a business that has a potential to perform the way that Amphenol does as a total company. And so we look for a business with good management, with technology that has the potential for what we would consider above average growth and above average profitability and we look to make the assessment as to whether or not we think the seeds for that are there when we go through our acquisition review process. We don't have hurdle rate for specific, sort of pinpoint financial metrics because this acquisition is really \u2013 it has its own potential and also has its particular place relative to financial performance criteria, some are better than our average, some are below our average and so each individual decision is really made as it\u2019s expensed [ph] for that particular opportunity. Operator : Our final question from William Stein, SunTrust. William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Two quick ones. First, if we can get an update on your view on organic growth for the year. I think previously you had a 1% to 4% view. I'm wondering if you are giving any update on that. And then Adam I have a follow-up on the wireless infrastructure business. Diana Reardon : So the organic growth was about 4 to 6% in the current guidance for the year. William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And then on the wireless infrastructure side, Adam, you have in the past talked about \u2013 you said a lot about this end market, some of which was different from what some of the other component companies in particular some semiconductor companies have been talking about for a while. One of the things that you highlighted is typically you don't get all regions working at once and now you're starting to see that in addition to this outside strength in China it sounds like. So this kind of begs the question, is this a peaking year and we should expect that in 2015 some of this business rolls off and we go to a more normalized level, or do you see it more as a new base off of which we are going to see still more growth in the future? How can we think about that growth going forward, please? R. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much for the question. I think it\u2019s really too early to talk here about, is this going to be \u2013 what will be the trends hat going into 2015 and beyond? I think we already feel pretty good that we\u2019re able to give a prognosis, the positive prognosis for what is usually quite a volatile market already for the next three quarters to say that we feel that, that is going to continue to have, a stronger position, a stronger growth rate than we had expected going into the year. So I wouldn't be able \u2013 in any position to be able to tell you what is 2015 going to be. What I can tell you though is this, as I said over the last 3 years we put a lot of effort into this market, even if it was a market that was not growing, architecturally that was not growing from an investment standpoint, we continued across the board to work to expand our position in the wireless market.  And I think part of the reason why we had such strong performance here in the first quarter and I don't know ultimately is the market growing at what rate, I think there have been maybe one data point earlier today which may have been slightly contrary to our result. But clearly our growth in the market is a very substantial one and I think that is really a realization of some of the benefit of those efforts that we made over the previous years to really again expand our position with OEMs, to broaden our technology, or the range of technologies on to these new forms of wireless base station and to expand the depth and the range of our penetration with wireless operators. And so I think regardless what happens in the market going forward, that position does not go away, it's not like we have a peek in terms of our position in the marketplace. Ultimately what\u2019s going to happen with the spending, only the, few people who are out there who make capital decisions in the wireless market, they are going to be the ones who are going to ultimately have to vote with their wallets here on what the trend is in spending. But our position in this market is extremely strong, stronger I would argue than it has ever been in the past. And with that, that gives us good confidence for this year and certainly I believe that going forward we will continue to have a very excellent position in that marketplace. William Stein \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Great, very helpful. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Will and I think that was our last questions. I will just take this final opportunity to thank all of you for your time and attention today, and to wish all of you a very happy and hopefully warm spring around the world. Thank you so much. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day.",

Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, the conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference for your host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Thank you, you may begin. Diana Reardon : Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon, and I\u2019m Amphenol's CFO. I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we would like to welcome you all for our second quarter earnings call. Our Q2 results were released this morning. I\u2019ll provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We\u2019ll then have a question-and-answer session. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.314 million and EPS of $9, exceeding the high end of the company\u2019s guidance and achieving new records of performance. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies compared to Q2 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding those acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in Q2 were up 7%. Sequentially, sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q1 of 2014. Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business which comprised 7% of our sales was up 2% from last year. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 17% from last year reflecting the benefit of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income increased $256 million from $224 million last year. Operating margin was 19.5% in the quarter compared to 19.7% last year and 18.8% last quarter. The decline in operating margin versus 2013 is primarily due to the lower profitability level of the advanced sensor business acquired in late 2013. As previously discussed, the acquisition is accretive on an earnings-per-share basis, but reduces the company\u2019s overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve overtime, based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. The sequential increase of 70 basis points in operating margins over the first quarter of 2014 represents a very good conversion margin on incremental sales of 32%. This strong performance resulted from an increase in operating margin in the interconnect business based on excellent operating execution and cost management on incremental sales volume. From a segment perspective, in the cable segment margins were 12.7% up from 12.2% last quarter and down from 13.8% last year, primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21%, up from 20.9% last quarter and down from 22% last year. We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement and we continue to believe that the company\u2019s entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control allows us to react in a fast and flexible manner, thereby constantly adjusting the business to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment. Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $20.1 million compared to $15.6 million last year. Due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. Other income was $4.3 million in the quarter, up from $3 million last year, primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% compared to 26.8% last year and net income was approximately 13% of sales in the quarter. Earnings per share increased 15% to a record $1.09 in Q2, up from $0.95 last year a very strong performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.320 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1-to-1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations in the quarter was $181 million or 102% of net income. For the six months ended June 30, operating cash flow was $383 million or 114% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventory with $805 million at the end of June up 4% from March. Inventory days were 81 days, consistent with March levels. Accounts receivable at the end of June was just over $1 billion up 6% from March and day sales outstanding declined one day to 70 days. Accounts payable increased 11% to $534 million at the end of June and payable days were up four days to 54-days. The cash flow from operations of a $181 million borrowing under the company\u2019s revolving credit facility of $120 million and $60 million of proceeds from stock option exercise were used primarily to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares of the company's stock for $129 million to fund capital expenditures of $52 million and acquisition of payments of $10 million in the quarter and for dividend payments of $31 million. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash investment of $144 million during the quarter. At the end of June, cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $1.4 billion the majority of which is held outside the US. Total debt was $2.3 billon bring net debt at the end of the quarter to $900 million. At quarter end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $290 million and $1.2 billion respectively. And EBITDA of Q2 was approximately $308 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had 2.9 million shares remaining under its 10 million stock of purchase program, which expires in January of 2015. And as mentioned in the earning release the company\u2019s Board of Directors has approved an increases in the quarterly dividend on the company\u2019s common stock from $0.20 to $0.25 per share increasing the yield to just over 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October. From a financial perspective this was an excellent performance. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. R. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Diana and I would also like to add my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. As Diana mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our second quarter achievements and in particular I\u2019ve planned to discuss the trends and the progress across our various served markets. Finally I will make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter and as well as for the full-year of 2014, and we\u2019ll certainly leave some time at the end for question. I\u2019m just very proud that in the second quarter Amphenol has set again new records in sales and earnings per share and exceeded the high end of our guidance. Diana mentioned sales increased 16% from prior year and 5% sequentially, establishing for the company a new record of $1,314 billion in sale. We are also very pleased that our order has reached also a new record of $1,320 billion with the book to bill up above one. And profitability as Diana mentioned was very robust in the quarter and we generated strong sequential conversion margin, which led to an expansion of our industry leading operating margins to 19.5%. And Finally, I would just like to note that with the Board of Directors approving the 25% increase in our company\u2019s quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.25, this is yet another very clear indication of the sustained financial strength of Amphenol. I\u2019m just very proud of our global team these record results reconfirm the strength of entrepreneurial culture. As the Amphenol management team has once again able to react quickly to the many, many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution all the electrocides in the consistent discipline and drive necessary to create outstanding operating performance. The strength of our strategy of market diversification also was very evident in the second quarter. The Amphenol business remains extremely balanced and broad with no single end market representing more than 17% of our total sales in the quarter. Turning to the trends and progress across those markets, the military market represent 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly from prior year and up slightly from prior quarter as growth in military vehicle, airframe as well as communications applications was offset by overall reduced demand in other segments of the military market. There is no question that the overall military market remains uncertain. But nevertheless we expect demand in the third quarter to grow slightly from these levels and we continue to expect this market to return to growth in the second half as volumes increased related to new programs on which we have higher content. We\u2019re very confident that our technology leadership and broad program participation positions us to benefit long-term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware as well as from growth in military hardware spending in emerging geographies. The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 4% sequentially, due essentially to increased jetliner production as well our expanded content on new airplane platforms. In addition we continue to benefit form the Ionix acquisition that we completed at the end of last year. While we do expect some normal seasonal moderation in demand in the third quarter we continue to maintain a very positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond. We simply have an excellent and expanding position in this exciting market and we continue to take advantage of the many new technology opportunities that are arising on new airplane platforms. In particular as our new interconnect technologies are able to resolve an increasing variety of challenges based by our customers who are designing and building next generation planes. We\u2019re confident that our position will continue to strengthen over time. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. We had extremely strong sales growth of 52%, which was supported by the Advanced Sensors acquisition completed at the end of 2014. We had also very strong organic growth of 16%, which was driven by gains in the medical, instrumentation, rail mass transit, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas segments. On a sequential basis sales increased 8% with growth in virtually all areas of the industrial market that we play in. We\u2019re especially encouraged by the breadth and balance of our industrial growth, which is a clear validation of our long standing strategy of diversification across the broad array of segments within this important market. In addition, I would like to note that we are very pleased to be seeing early in positive signs of the value of our newly acquired sensor portfolio to our industrial customers around the world. In the third quarter, we expect further growth despite what is a traditionally seasonally softer quarter. As we continue to make excellent progress broadening our technology offering, while increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth areas of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market also increased a very strong 42% from prior year and 18% organically. We continued to benefit from the diverse range of new sensor and infotainment automotive products that are provided by Advanced Sensors and Tecvox, the two acquisitions we made at the end of last year. And we also grew our sales organically with new products used in Telematics, in emissions management, as well drive train control application. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 3% in the automotive market. Automakers continue to incorporate advanced interconnect and sensor products into a wide array of vehicle electronic system, which is really creating great opportunities for our company. In addition, we\u2019re beginning to see interesting opportunities to leverage our interconnect and sensor product range together to create new solutions for automotive customers. Ultimately, we\u2019re confident that our broad high technology offering will enable us to continue to outperform the overall automotive market. Looking towards the third quarter, we expect the slight increase in sales and what is also typically a more seasonally moderate quarter. And we look forward to an excellent 2014 and beyond for expanding automotive business. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased stronger-than-expected 8% from prior year driven by higher demand for products used essentially in mobile computing devices including both tablets and laptops. Well we had expected some sequential decline in sales coming into the quarter in fact we were able achieve 6% growth over the first quarter, as we\u2019re able to quickly adjust our production resources in order to capitalize on higher levels of demand across the broad range of devices and customers. Looking ahead to the second half, we now anticipate a somewhat faster ramp-up of sales in the mobile device market and thus expect overall sales to grow in the range of low-single-digits for the full-year. This increase from our previous expectations of mid-to-high-single-digit decline relates to stronger than expected outlook on a range of existing programs together with some benefit from new product launches. The mobile device market remains no question extremely dynamic. It is really only through our leading technology offering together with our outstanding and extremely agile team, that we are able to continue to react quickly to capitalize on any opportunities that arise to drive growth in this important market. The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and we executed very well and what is just simply an excellent quarter in the mobile networks market. Our sales increased a very strong 26% over prior year and 16% sequentially. While this sales growth was strongest in Asia in fact our sales grew strongly in all our major geographies and was balanced across our wide range of both equipment manufacturers, as well as, our site materials sold direct to operators. While we continue to anticipate in the second half a somewhat lower level of demand, we maintain a very positive view of the mobile networks market for the full-year 2014. We\u2019re very encouraged that our long-term technology investments across the broadest array of interconnect and antenna products has positioned us strongly to capitalize on accelerating next-generation mobile network deployments and we look forward to continuing to build on this position in the long-term. The information technology and data communications market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter, as we\u2019d expected sales decreased by roughly 6% from prior year on primarily lower sales of networking related products. Sequentially sales did increase slightly as growth in servers and networks products were partially offset by a moderation of sales of products that are used in storage systems. Based on our latest input from customers in the IT market, we did not expect any significant increase of demand in the third quarter and accordingly we continue to anticipate that our sales will be flat to slightly down for the full-year in this market. There are clearly some market uncertainties in the IT market, but despite these uncertainties we remain very confident in our long-term position in the IT datacom market. Due to our leading technology offering, our preferred supplier relationships with a very wide array of OEMs as well as our fast growing presence with direct with datacenter operators and web service providers. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter, sales declined slightly from prior year on a moderation of spending in particular from U.S. cable operators an increase as we had expected by around 4% from the first quarter. While the market environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenged and while the competitive pricing environment remains difficult. We are encouraged to see still emerging benefits of our products and customer diversification, which has enabled us bother to grow our range of broadband customers while also offering, what is the more complete interconnect product range. Moving into the third quarter we expect sale in the broadband market to increase from these levels and we look forward to maintaining a strong position in the broadband market. Well looking back on the second quarter I can just say again that we are just extremely proud of the entire Amphenol organization who has continued to execute well in what remain very challenging and dynamic market environment. Our superior performance is a direct reflection of Amphenol\u2019s distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customer across the diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure, at end of the day the company\u2019s greatest strength continues to be Amphenol\u2019s high performance culture, which gets reinforced every single day by the company\u2019s agile and entrepreneurial management team. Turning towards our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, based on constant exchange rates as well as the assuming stable economic condition and in consideration of our strong second quarter performance, as well as current expectation for the reminder of the year we\u2019re very pleased to be able to increase our guidance. We now expect in the third quarter as well as in the full-year of 2014 the following result. We expect sale in the range of $1,320 billion to $1,350 billion and $5,210 billion to $5,270 billion respectively. And for EPS we expect for the quarter and the year in the range of $1.12 to $1.15 and $4.35 to $4.41 respectively. For the full-year, this guidance now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 13% to 14% and 13% 15% respectively a very strong guidance. We\u2019re very encouraged by our strengthening outlook in sales and earnings. Especially, given the many continuing dynamics across the global economy. Look, the ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create for us tremendous opportunities. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities, both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability. And thereby, to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol. Thank you very much. And at this time, operator we will be happy to take any questions that they maybe. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Hi, thank you, Adam and Diana. I wanted to just ask about what is driving the upside to the guidance. When you look at it, just looking through the segments, it seems like maybe mobile devices is driving some of that; you raised your outlook for the second half. I just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 is that the right way to think about it? Which areas are really driving the upside? R. Adam Norwitt :  Yes, Sherri, thank you very much. I think you put your finger on it mobile devices it certainly of all the markets to won that have the biggest change in terms of our outlook I think the other markets there some small puts and takes, but as I mentioned we certainly are pleased that not only were we able to react quickly to what was essentially some unexpected degree of demand in the second quarter, but we continue to believe that will translate into some higher levels and we had expected in the coming third quarter as well as through the year. And ultimately we go from having felt that market would have been it kind of a mid to high single-digit decline to low single-digit increased on the year-over-year basis. So that no doubt it all of them the most meaningful change in the guidance. Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.: Okay. And then, Adam, I was hoping to get your thoughts about the demand environment right now. I think in the press release you said there is still a lot of uncertainty, but just wanted to get the sense of \u2013 do you think that things have gotten better? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Yes, well, thank you very much. I mean I\u2019ve said many times before that I don\u2019t fancy myself at all a macroeconomist. We read the papers and there is no question that there remain still a lot of turbulence in the world no doubt about it some of our markets have a more fair wind behind them if you look at marketplace the automotive market and the industrial market, wireless infrastructure clearly these are markets commercial aerospace and other ones we\u2019re outperforming significantly we believe the end market but the overall markets are performing well. At the same time, you just have to look at a cross section of earnings releases from various OEMs in the electronics industry to know that not everything is going up into the right. There continues to be a lot of dynamics in the market from every corner and that\u2019s not to mention any kind of geopolitical things that happened or don\u2019t happen in time. Is the overall economy growing at a different pace of GDP? That I have no idea, we are not commissioning studies about this and I actually don\u2019t spend a lot of my time to look at what the GDP trends are that are half a point better or half a point worse. But we see a lot of opportunities ourselves to capitalize on that change, because at the end of the day when there is dynamics, the agility of how we run the company and the agility of the culture of Amphenol has just so much power to take an advantage of that change. Unexpected things that come from every corner of the electronics industry, these are the things that the Amphenol team is just so capable at taking advantage of and its not taking advantage up here at headquarters that Diana and I kind of directing traffic, it\u2019s more having our general managers around the world, really sensing out in real-time when those dynamics are coming and taking advantage of them. And I think this quarter was a great example of our ability to really find those areas of strength take advantage of them better than maybe others can do and thereby to drive the results that you have seen. Sherri A. Scribner \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.:  Thank you. Diana G. Reardon: Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt :  Thank you so much, Sherri. Operator :  Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research your line is open. Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.:  Hi, congrats on the quarter. Sorry to maybe take a negative tone toward the mobile devices business, but the past two years, as you had positive expectations heading into the back half of the year, some surprises came out. I guess, what is different this year? Is there more content per device that you are seeing? It sounds like you picked up a little bit of share during the second quarter, but maybe just flesh out why this year will be different than prior years? R. Adam Norwitt : Yes, no, Shawn it\u2019s not a negative, we don\u2019t take it negatively whatsoever. I think what we have always said is the mobile devices market is extremely dynamic. Just to Sherri\u2019s question, mentioned that we see a lot of dynamics around all the markets, but there is none that are more extreme than mobile devices and we certainly don\u2019t feel that we are oracles in that market in terms of being able to always predict perfectly what happened. At the same time, our team is just very reactive. And so in the second quarter it\u2019s true, whether that\u2019s picking up share I mean we were able to satisfy customers on a more expedient fashion than others were. And that can carryover going into the second half and we believe it will. We are always prudent in how we look at this market; we are not going to give forecast to the penny in terms of what every rosy outlook that you may reason to media would, so we are always very prudent in this market. I think when we look last year at the change there was a kind of a structural change in the technology of the products and that let us to have a second half that wasn\u2019t what we expected to be. We don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to repeated itself, as we talked about that was a one-time shift. And I think, looking at the second half today in the mobile devices market, we feel that there we have strong position whether it\u2019s a gaining share or not it\u2019s already a very strong position. We\u2019re able to satisfy customers on the ramps that they have around increased demand that they have and that\u2019s serves as well going into the second half. And we\u2019ll see how it goes. Again we \u2013 we\u2019re not perfect at picking where that market goes, but we\u2019re excellent at capitalizing on it regardless. Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.:  Very fair. Then, Diana, there is a $600 million piece of debt coming due in the middle of November. What are your expectations in terms of \u2013 will you refinance that? Will you pay it off with the credit facility? How should we think about that piece of debt coming due? Diana G. Reardon: Sure, I think we have options in that regard we did if you recall, do a debt offering in January of this year in anticipation of the fact that we had the maturity coming up in November and could take advantage of the rates at that time all the rates are still quite low now. So I think we have options, one option certainly would be, it\u2019s refinance it with another bond offering and another option is to use availability under our revolver and we certainly have plenty of room there and I think we\u2019ll make that these vision as we go along here in the next few months. Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.: But none of those accretive dynamics are included in guidance currently? Diana G. Reardon: I think the guidance would assume that we do some sort of refinancing sort of coincidence with the date of the maturity of the bonds offering, but I wouldn\u2019t expect that whatever we do would have a very substantial impact. Shawn M. Harrison \u2013 Longbow Research LLC.: Got you, thanks so much. Diana G. Reardon: Sure. R. Adam Norwitt :  Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Steven Fox from Cross Research, your line is open. Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC :  Thanks. Good afternoon. A couple of questions just on some of the comments you've made so far, Adam. First of all, in the mobile devices market, talking about satisfying your customers quicker than others, can you just expand on what you were referring to and what kind of capabilities you seem to have gained that are giving you that advantage? And then I have a follow-up. R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, I mean, look, it just comes down to \u2013 since it is such a volatile market Steve, that demand can go up and demand can go down very rapidly and dealing with that is not easy. I mean that can mean you got a higher lot of people or you got to do the opposite that can mean you have to be, you have to work in a way that selectable from a capital standpoint from how you setup production lines, I mean there is just a whole host of things and I can tell that I\u2019m not going to go into any detail here, because some of that what I would consider nice proprietary secret sauce about our success, but at the end of the day, it comes down to a mind set. The culture of Amphenol and organization is probably better than anyone here having covered the company for so long. We come down to general managers in the company, 85 of them are around the world who run these businesses in real-time and they have all the tool at their disposal to make changes without having to go through layers-upon-layers to say can I do this or I cannot do this? In that market in particular, the customer come to you at noon and they need an answer by 12.30 and if you have to go through some approval process to say \u201cwell I\u2019m going to go hire another 150 people or 500 people or I\u2019m going to buy this machine, I\u2019m going to do this\u201d you have already missed the opportunity, because someone else has given them that answer by 12.30 when they ask that question at noon. And it\u2019s that real-time ability to respond that is essentially in the DNA of our culture and how we are organized that serves us so well on that market. On the flip side obviously when there are downturn as we've experience in times past, it also serves you well, because you can make quick adjustment to your resources to preserve the bottom line of the company and thereby it makes that business sustainable, because if you get into a mobile device business where you go through these kind of convulsive ups and down with restructuring and plant closing and other things, you are never going to be prepared for when that up side comes, because you are now recovering from that kind of massive change that had to undergo at the last downturn and so because we are able to do that in real-time with general managers who make real decisions everyday, it just makes it a much, much more successful and it makes us more able to deal with that dynamic market. Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC :  Great. Thanks for that. Then just as a quick follow-up, with regard to the Sensor acquisition, I know you're not going to provide details in terms of financials; but you did mention a couple of times, when you talked about industrial and auto in particular, that you are already seeing opportunities to leverage that portfolio. I was hoping you can give us maybe some examples or just guide us in terms of what you mean and what kind of time frame that would be related to. Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt :  Sure. Thank you very much, its great question. I\u2019m not going to give specific product examples for obvious competitive reason, but I can just tell you I have personally been over the course of the last quarter to a quite a number of customers, because I wanted to sit in front of those customers and hear it from them how they felt about this and what they saw for the future and I can tell you it\u2019s really universal. They are so pleased to have us coming in as a company with tremendous resources with a tremendous history in particular and high reliability harsh environment product. I mean we invented most of these harsh environment high reliability products we have been the company for the better part of century who they recognized as that enterprise and then to come in and bringing together that core sensor technology become all the way from the sensor element to the ability to package it, that has been just such a wonderful story to tell and has received just a great reception these are customers in a wide variety of areas, in a wide variety of regions. Steven B. Fox \u2013 Cross Research LLC :  Great. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. R. Adam Norwitt : Thanks Steve. Operator : Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Yes, thanks. Hi, Adam and Diana. Question, Adam, regarding the mobile networks business, mobile infrastructure business, where you have had strength and you're talking about a moderation. Is that just based on what you are seeing in terms of programs? And there has been some semiconductor companies out there talking about some push-outs in orders because of a mismatch of components, where there are some component shortages which are gating production. Are you seeing any of that? Or what are some of the things you are seeing in terms of visibility there? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure, no, thank you very much for the question, I mean look mobile networks has been very positive market for this year and I think we\u2019ve been speaking consistently through the course of the year that we felt that there was probably more first half spending and second half. Now all that being said even with some moderation in our business in mobile networks in the second half that would still be up quite significantly on the year-over-year basis. The shortages as that you\u2019ve talked about these are directly impacting us I mean most of these shortages that are being talked about around the industry have to do more with semiconductor, but clearly they impact customers and their ability to procure all the components to make the sell-side equipment. And that can have an impact on our business as well and I think if you would ask me at the very beginning of the year I probably would have told you that the second half have a more pronounced downturn than the type of moderation that we\u2019re anticipating today. So I think there has been some of that stretching out that you mentioned I think that maybe somewhat more magnified in Asia where they\u2019ve just been a few very significant build out so it used a lot of components and some of those components aren\u2019t \u2013 no one can make half of them. None of those are our components we\u2019re doing a fabulous job to satisfy the increase in demand and we have had really no issue to support what are very significant increases in this business I mean if you think about it on the sequential basis in the mobile networks market of 16% increased that\u2019s pretty significant to deal with in a 90 day period and we\u2019ve had no problem to deal with that. We look forward and we feel very good about how that market is progressing this year. And one thing, I think I talked about it last quarter, but I just want to reemphasize. This was a very difficult market for the better part of two three years to mobile infrastructure market. It would have been very easy to throw in the towel and just say that is a bad place to be. Let\u2019s not invest, let\u2019s not spend the time, let\u2019s put our people elsewhere, let\u2019s forget about those customers. we didn\u2019t do that and we don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s not how we run our company. We knew that there was a pent-up demand in that one day, who knows when that one day would be, but that one day there would be a requirement to upgrade the networks and we wanted to make sure that we are well positioned for that. I think this year, we are really realizing the fruits of that confidence and that persistent that we had and continuing to work in that market, which for the better part of three years was not the most fun market to report upon. Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Okay. That's very helpful and just as a follow-up, regarding the mobile devices where you are seeing strength and I know you have got basically three customer segments there, Adam, with mobile computing and smartphones and tablets. And I know that dynamic has changed somewhat for you in terms of the breakdown. Could you give us an idea of where you are seeing the strength? Is it across all those three segments? And give us an idea of the breakdown within those segments of that business? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure and I unfortunately not going to give you the breakdown strictly and that\u2019s something that certainly we try to keep somewhat closer to our best, relative to customers and competitors, but I can tell you that the strength in the quarter as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we saw more coming out of mobile computing devices on a year-over-year basis coming really from mobile computing devices, which is a range of things, tablets, laptops, eReaders, Ultrabooks, you name it. On a sequential basis, we actually saw more strength coming out of smartphones and also some on laptops and maybe less out of things like tablet. And looking forward, I think we have a positive outlook really across the board for those on a sequential basis. We look at kind of the second half to the first half where we certainly have a strong expectation for sales growth. I think we would see that growth really across all the areas. Matt J. Sheerin \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks a lot Adam. R. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Matt. I appreciated it. Operator : Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Perfect, thanks a lot, good afternoon guys. Two questions for me maybe Adams just on the mobile devices side historically you\u2019ve had volatility that\u2019s typically been related to one customer. Do you think with the strength you are seeing, the ramps you are seeing is more than just one OEM are there multiple customer that you are excited about or is just one customer driven ramp? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure, thanks Amit for the question. I think, we have never said that volatility in that market is related to one customer, I think what I have always said is there are always different leaders in this market over history and we\u2019ve seen many companies cycle through the leadership position and we've dealt with that regardless of who and then we\u2019ve grown our business consistently regardless of that. As we look towards to strength in our business, I would tell you that it\u2019s certainly not just one customer, we are working with a lot of customers in that market, there is a lot of companies who are establishing what I would call unique niches of strength in various regions and we have great position with all of them. Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC:  Fair enough. Then just as a follow-up, Diana, your conversion margins were not 30% I think this quarter on a sequential basis; you are guiding for better than that I think in September. How much of that is being driven by maybe accretion or integration from the Sensors acquisition versus other tailwinds that you are seeing? And can you sustain this 30% conversion margin beyond June and September really? Diana G. Reardon: Sure, I think that we as you pointed out we did achieve good conversion margin in Q2, and I think just on a long-term basis the company has a very good track record of strong conversion margins and strong profitability achievement in a pretty diverse set of environments. This particular conversion margin in Q2 was inline with what we expected for the quarter and the guidance in the second half for Q3 and Q4 is also actually consistent with the guidance that we had last quarter, it just on now a higher level of sales. And the Q2 conversion margin, was largely attributable to just great operating execution in our interconnect business. in the second half of the year, there is some small contribution from, some expected improvement and some of the acquisitions from last year, but I would say largely the improvement in ROS and the stronger conversion margin is just coming out a very strong operation execution on the base business. And the drivers of that strong profitability are really an unrelenting focus on cost, the tension to the top line in terms of which new business we choose to participate in making sure we stay on the high end of technology and therefore can demand appropriate value from a pricing perspective. So while there is some small contribution, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year to have the acquisition reach what we would consider as full potential to be that would dwell beyond 2014. Amit J. Daryanani \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful and congrats on the good quarter guys. Diana G. Reardon: Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Amit. Operator : Thank you [technical difficulty]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on the M&A environment today and the pipeline and maybe also comment a little bit about product category that you will be going after and you recently acquired center business from GE and I wonder if that\u2019s going to be a particular focus going forward? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt :  Yes. No, thank you very much. Obviously M&A has always been for us a real core component of the company\u2019s expansion strategy and we been doing M&A for a long, long time \u2013 certainly well north of decade and decade and half. During that time period we acquired just so many fabulous company\u2019s and last year and if you take the last two years, we acquired 10 companies in two years and we continue to have just a very vibrant and strong pipeline and we continue to look at M&A not as well we are only going to go in one direction or we going go after this pace in technology but rather we believe there great M&A opportunities across the various markets that we serve. If you just look back over a two year period when we made those 10 acquisitions those 10 acquisitions were across that have been five or six of our end market. So there was not at all kind of doubling down on one or another one of our markets and one and other of our technologies.  At the end of the day what we look at from an acquisition as we look at, sort of three simple things number one, first and foremost is management. We look for company\u2019s that have great leadership. Leadership of people who want to continue with the business, and we want them to continue with the business who will operate in the Amphenol organization as the entrepreneurs just like our other 85 general managers do in such a effective passion. Next we look at technology we want company\u2019s that are really high technology providers people who solve problems for their customers and whatever space they maybe in. And then finally you obviously want company\u2019s who have a complementary market position to our own. And despite the size of Amphenol and the breadth that we operate and there is still just a wider ray of potential acquisition and potential company\u2019s that can fit those kind of three litmus test that we have. You notice what I didn\u2019t talk about is hurdle rates and things like this because that\u2019s not how we run our acquisition we pay fair prices for things. We certainly look for acquisitions to be accretive in the first year, but ultimately we believe that if you have the right people, and you have right technology and you are doing that in a complementary fashion to our own that\u2019s going to be very, very successful acquisition program. It shown to be such over many, many years and we believe for many years to come and we will continue to be great asset for the company. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks and congrats on the quarter. R. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much. Operator : Mike Wood, Macquarie Research. Your line is open. Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research : Hi, thank you. Also to follow up on the M&A question. How are you currently viewing making additional acquisitions in the sensor market? Do you need to first integrate Advance Sensors or do you have the capacity to make other acquisition in adjacent connect to a products and if you could also comment on the size of sensor opportunities out there in the market. R. Adam Norwitt :  Sure, thanks very much Mike. Look we have capacities to make a lot of acquisitions, I think we showed it last Q4, we made four acquisitions in a short time period and we didn\u2019t expand our little headquarters stuff here to do that so there is capacity to make the acquisitions is not a question, so we would not at all restrict ourselves from making another sensor acquisition given the fact that we just acquired GE business just over a half year ago. So we will continue to look for a companies across the board and interconnect and sensors and antennas and other things that we do and we\u2019re the confident that that will bear fruits overtime. The other thing you asked about size and I mentioned the various criteria that we use for acquisition, size is not one of those criteria. So we have the capacity and we have to wherewithal to buy companies really of any size subject to the fact that they fit in our other criteria of having good people and great technology and I think that we have a wonderful financial capacity to do those acquisitions and to the extensive there are companies of a greater size we would not shy away from pursuing them if they were the appropriate companies to buy. Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research :  Okay. Could you also comment on how much of your cable business is now the specialty growth that you were pursuing versus the more commoditized product and is that pricing pressure limited to certain areas of that cable business? R. Adam Norwitt : We don\u2019t break it down by product specifically, again competitive reasons are important to be sensitive to here, but what I can tell you is both with the Holland acquisition that we made a couple of years ago as well as our internal development efforts, we have a much broader array of products today beyond just cable and reels that we sold for so many years and one can imagine that the growth profile of the business would not be surprising for you to learn that those kind of products grow at somewhat faster rates than do the bulk cable product. Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Equity Research :  Okay, thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open. James D. Suva \u2013 Citigroup:  Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. I have one question for Adam and then one question for Diana. So just taking them in that order, Adam, great results, but when we do look at the details underneath it, I think there is still a few little areas of potential improvement and want to see if you are aware of them, or if you are seeing that there is the potential to improve on it, or what your course is. Not specifically regarding the cable products. I believe it is about 7% of your company, so not a big part. Most of the questions previously asked were on the other bigger parts. But on the cable parts, you are hitting multiyear high in sales levels, but your profitability is the opposite direction, not hitting multiyear highs. So is that more excess industry capacity? Is that more pricing by competitors? Is it product misplacement? Or how come we are not seeing, with you hitting multiyear high in sales there, not better profitability? Then for Diana, on the dividend increase, I believe and I personally feel that M&A and organic growth, I guess organic growth first and M&A second is the best use of cash. So to see your dividend increase, is that just simply you want to have a rule of thumb of a 1% dividend yield going forward? Or is that the M&A opportunities are less? Or how should we think about the increase in dividend? R. Adam Norwitt :  Yes, Jim, thank you for those obviously two excellent questions. Relative to cable, I mean I just talked about our strategy in cable, which is really to work to diversify our product types. I have spoken many times about the fact the cable environment, the pricing environment has been a very challenging environment for a quite sometime it continues to be a very challenging environment. We continue to be a company that is very disciplined and we will remain disciplined in our cable pricing. But when you have a market which is so concentrated, we are also not just going to let the market totally fall through our fingers. So, we will always let the leaders in that market set the price and we will follow that. As I have always said, by the time the sun has set we don\u2019t let a price increase fall through our fingers. But at the same time you mentioned it very well, it has become a much smaller portion of the business it\u2019s important part of the business to be in the broadband market per say. Because, we have our cable product segment, but the broadband market remains one of the most important areas in terms of delivering high speed data to customers home. And so we remain very committed to that market even if the cable products, margins are certainly lower than we would like and you can bet that our team will continue to work towards getting those margins up. Diana G. Reardon: And in terms of the second question, Jim, I think that there certainly has been no change relative to the company strategy regarding capital deployment. And we had a very consistent strategy for many years now. And from a prioritization perspective, certainly while we do prioritize the acquisition program in terms of using the financial strength, we also feel that a flexible and balanced approach is equally important. And I think if you would look at the historical pattern for the company, whether you look at 2013 or you look at back over the last five years. We\u2019ve typically about half of our free cash flow and I think we just generated something along $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion over the last five years and free cash flow about half of that is going to fund the acquisition program, which has been a very successful program and added a lot of value for the company and about in the other of that about is gone back to shareholders. And that return of capital to shareholders has been a balance of stock buyback and the dividend which really didn\u2019t get 20 real amount until 2013. So the dividend is very much a part of the strategy of having flexible and balanced approach on increase that we announce, brings yield up to about a 1% yield. In the context of the approach that we have for that balance, we think that that is an appropriate level for the company, but the prioritization of the capital deployment has not changed. And certainly the acquisition program is still, from our perspective as a management team, the best source of long-term growth and profitability enhancement for the company. James D. Suva \u2013 Citigroup:  Thank you. Congratulations again to you and your team at Amphenol. Diana G. Reardon: Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much Jim. Operator : Thank you. James Kisner from Jefferies. Your line is open. James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick clarification. Did you guys buy any companies in the quarter? I just saw on your cash flow statement you spent $10 million on an acquisition. I don't think I heard you say anything about that. Maybe that is a prior announced acquisition. Diana G. Reardon: We had a couple of payments that related to some previous acquisitions and we had a very small acquisition \u2013 I call more of a vertical integration of a very small company that didn't rise to a level that we would be talking about. James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Great. And separately, just on the military piece, I am not sure if I heard you guys right that you said you are seeing some growth on hardware spend in emerging geographies. I guess I had always thought of this business as pretty much a domestic and Western business. I just want to understand your exposures there and what particular geographies you might be \u2013 you maybe exposed to in military, other than the U.S.. I guess I am just wondering longer-term, if there's conflicts around the world, could you potentially see some benefit from that? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt :  Well, thank you very much, look we\u2019re not trying to capitalize on world instability, so let me say that very much at the frontend here, we certainly hope that our conflicts around the world and we do our little piece to make sure that\u2019s not the case. But relative to emerging geographies, I have talked about this actually for quite some time. When we go back to the military market as the various U.S. and European driven conflicts we are winding down. I have talked a lot about the fact that we continue to see an offset to that overall reduction in the military spending environment from two areas. One is the expansion of electronics in the military. And we see that very much so, much more electronic content even if it\u2019s among a lower pool of spending and then in the second is those are merging geographies who continue to invest and continue to spend money on upgrading their military. Obviously as an American company, we are not going to do business with certain geographies they are places like China and Iran and obviously as the U.S. company you don\u2019t participate with those are all hand off, but there are a lot of countries around the world were you do work and you do work with them and we have worked with them for many, many, many years. I mean we have been in India for the better part of 43-years as the leader in the Indian military hardware. We have been in Israel for around essentially the history of Israel and history of Amphenol, places like Brazil, places like Malaysia, Singapore you name it, there are many, many places around the world who are actually increasing their degree of military spending and at the same time increasing the electronic component of that through \u2013 in order to modernize their militaries and that\u2019s something that we continue to see, we continue to have excellent presence in many of those place. Many of those are also working through U.S. manufactures of equipment or European manufactures of equipment. So we get some benefit just through the traditional U.S. and European defense manufactures, but we also have a lot of presence direct with indigenous companies in all of those regions. And I think the repetition that we have as really the world leader in this space. The technology trends that are in this space also serves us very, very well as we looked to capitalize on whatever growth opportunities there can be from these emerging geographies. James M. Kisner \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.:  Great thank you go much. R. Adam Norwitt :  Thank you Operator : [Technical difficult] Amitabh Passi from UBS. Your line is open. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS:  Hi, thank you. Adam, I had a couple of questions on a couple of your key markets. First one, automotive, 18% year-over-year organic growth. I think unit production growth is probably in the low, maybe mid single-digits. I think we all understand the content with story, but I wanted to understand : are there other factors that play here? Maybe you are seeing a firmer pricing environment, maybe you are gaining share. Or do you think we have hit an inflection on just the rate at which content is growing in automotives that continues to propel this segment at a pretty stable rate, particularly over the past few quarters? R. Adam Norwitt :  Yes. It\u2019s a great question Amithab I mean we\u2019re just very proud of the progress that we've made in the automotive market. We just take historical perspective for Amphenol you may recall if we go back in a five, five and half years ago automotive was I think Q1 of 2009 it was like 6% of our sales and now here it is 15% of our sale and that growth has come really from two parallel initiatives. One is to develop new products that can capitalize on the expansion of electronic functionality in the car. And so we've done that just so well getting in front of exhaust management, drive a train, onboard electronics, Telematics, infotainment, you name it, where we work very carefully and very closely with customers at all tiers in the automotive world to really help them to enable new systems. It wasn\u2019t necessarily that were taking share out of someone else\u2019s hand, it was that we were helping to enable new functionalities in the car with our existing capabilities to make strong interconnect products. And sometimes these weren\u2019t even just simple piece-part components, but they were complex interconnect systems and that something from organic standpoint that we just done an outstanding job of.  And then in parallel, we made some excellent acquisitions over that same time period, where we have really broadened the range of products that we sell into cars around the world. And then, once we make those acquisitions but they don\u2019t just joined the company and sort of stay in the static position forever, we work with them to cross sell into customers, to work with them to help to enable next-generation systems bringing together the technologies within our automotive group. And I think those efforts all collectively have resulted in us achieving the results that you\u2019ve seen for several years running and including this quarter I think 18% growth, no matter how you slice it, is outperforming the market organically by probably quite a wide margin. And we believe that we have just laid a great platform here. We are clearly not the leader in this space, nor do we aspire to be the leader in this space. But we want to be a stronger participant who works very much in those high value, high technology in new electronics application. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS:  And then just as a quick follow-up on your IT datacom segment. I think for the past couple of quarters, you had also started to talk about trying to diversify your customer base, maybe serving some of the cloud service providers directly. Where are we in that process? When do you think it starts to move the needle and maybe serve as an offset to some of the pressure you are seeing with your existing OEM customer base? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, it\u2019s an excellent question and certainly this has been a big initiative for us for a quite some time. I can tell you we have in our company a lot of operations who work with, what I would call service providers. And that is a really unique asset that we have in the company understanding how service providers work as opposed to how OEMs work. They are extremely different in what they care about, what their priorities are, what the predictability of their spending patterns are. But I think we have a great head start on that because of our kind of cultural awareness how to work with those companies and our ability to kind of tack differently and work with those customers when we have been so accustomed to working with the OEMs. The IT market is very dynamic space. You just got to look at few of the earnings releases that have come out recently and then you compare that to some of the earnings releases of service providers and look at the capital that they are spending there is a massive disconnect that is happening in that market. And so there is no question that the success in the future is going to be tied very much to our success in broadening the customer base. And I can tell you that we are doing a fabulous job of that so far. It\u2019s early days because I think the market is in flux somewhat. So is that transition happened how the service providers, to what degree do they take control of certain things? To what degree do they cede control to the traditional OEMs that whole lay of the land, if you will, is still very much in flux. But however it shakes out, we are going to be well positioned for the long-term. Amitabh Passi \u2013 UBS: Okay, excellent. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.:  Thanks very much. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. On mobile devices, can you talk about to what extent you have been able to capitalize on strong growth of 4G handsets in emerging markets? R. Adam Norwitt : No, no, that\u2019s an excellent question. I think we don\u2019t talk specifically about individual products, but no doubt that next-generation whether that\u2019s called 3G, 4G, LTE, TD-LTE, I am sure there\u2019s other acronyms that I am missing here. Those are clearly driving some of the growth in the overall space. I think we \u2013 I mentioned in the past many times that when we working the mobile device market, we work there with a very simple framework, which is we are going to participate in those devices where there is value in our product and usually that translates into where there is value in the hardware. I think what we have started to see. In handsets in particular is certain companies who have realized that it is just not enough to put either an Android or a Windows operating system in your phone and sell it kind of in the blank box. And that there is differentiation happening, competitive differentiation happening among certain customers and that includes customers in less developed or emerging markets. China is one place. Whether China is emerging anymore, I don\u2019t know, but certainly that one place where there is a lot of competition happening and where there are kind of domestic companies not the global name brands, who are competing on the performance, the functionality, the use of the product relative to hardware not just the software. And those are areas, which have to potential at least to create for us an opportunity to expand our position. So I think from that standpoint, long-winded answer to the question, I would say : Yes, that\u2019s create an opportunity. Whether it is just 4G that I wouldn\u2019t be so sure of. But if there are new devices with new functionality, then no doubt about it that can create for us an opportunity. Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.: Understood. Thank you for that. For a follow-up question, I am hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on some of the order trends. You were already discussing the mobile networks, and if you could discuss any differences you are seeing there between connectors and antennas, and then what some of the underlying drivers of the trends are between units, pricing, or increased content per system. R. Adam Norwitt :  Sure. No, I mean, I\u2019m not going to get into specifics about the various products that we sell into that market, but I can tell you that we have a very broad offering, and I think, I mentioned in my early remarks that we\u2019re very pleased with the growth across-the-board, whether that is our direct sales of interconnect products to OEMs, our sales to operators the both interconnect products as well as antennas. We are very pleased with the contributions from all of those, and I think we have a very balanced business across both the products as well as the channel, the ultimate channel through which we sell our product and I think we have stronger order trends across-the-board. The thing that is unique this year in the mobile infrastructure market, besides just that the overall capital spending seems to be more favorable than it has been in several years past, is that the fact that you are seeing growth and not insignificant growth on a global basis. Not just concentrated in one or another of the various geographies. And I think that is something that is unique. I personally believe it is just because of consumer pressure, that they want those devices to have fast video with no latency. Now that they have TVs sitting in their hands, they want to able to use this TVs that are in their hands; and that is putting a lot of pressure on operators on a global basis to be competitive. And when you have one operator in one place just as well now I got the fastest LTE or 4G or whatever you call it, immediately the other ones got to react or else they are going to start to lose customers and its expenses for them when they lose this customers. So, I think that has been a real tipping point with prevalence of the devices that now drives overall those investments. And as it comes back to just our position, we have just an outstanding and very broad technology position on interconnect products, on antennas, on cable assemblies, on connectors, RF, fiber optics, high speed you name it, the full range of products that are used in these very advanced new system. Mark Delaney \u2013 Goldman Sachs Inc.: Thank you very much. Diana G. Reardon:  Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, you mentioned last quarter that you expected sequential ramps in the back half in mobile devices. Clearly that is proving out to be a lot stronger now. So would you characterize that the upside is coming from upside demand forecasts from programs that you were prior expected to drive that sequential strength? Or would you say these are completely new wins in products that you did not expect 90 days ago? And I have a follow-up. R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, thank you very much for the question, Wamsi. I just very simply would say it comes from a combination of all of that I think that we have better demand on existing, and we have better expectations for some new product. And that\u2019s I think a very simple answer to the question. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks, Adam. Can you remind us how much of your revenue goes through distribution now? And is there a plan to change your go-to-market for the sensor products? Are the system designers and buyers the same for the interconnect and sensor products or you need to built some infrastructure and change go-to-market for that? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt :  Sure. No, it\u2019s an excellent question. First, relative to distribution, it is about 12% of our sales goes through distribution. We have no tops-down initiative to say. Well, now we got to change all of our channels relative to sensors or we got that take full advantage of whatever strength that we have. Obviously, to the extent that we have some customers or distributors who are interested now in the sensor products that we can offer simply because they are now part of Amphenol. We are not going to led those opportunities go by the wayside. So we will take advantage of them. Relative to your question about inside the customers, whether that is always the same person, as I mentioned earlier, I have gone to a number of customers since we have made the acquisition strong customers that we had previously as well as customers with whom the Advanced Sensors business is strong. And I would tell you that it depends. I think there are some customers where it is not at all the same people. And I think in general the engineers are not the same people, but ultimately from a procurement and strategic procurement standpoint, it usually all ends up at one top of a pyramid. The thing that I have seen and alluded to it earlier is even those engineers who, let\u2019s say are just sensor engineer or conversely are just an interconnect engineer, it appears from my conversations with them that one of the greatest frustration those individual engineers have is the challenges that they face with the sort of corresponding technology. So in other words you have an interconnect engineer who is having to design things for a system that incorporates a sensor, he doesn\u2019t really understand that sensor. Now that you can come in as a company like we now can and sell that together with our sensors engineer, our interconnect engineer, you can really solve the big problem for that person because interestingly, a lot of our customer are really big companies and they don\u2019t necessarily communicate internally as well as we can necessarily communicate internally. So you can help to actually bridge some of the gap in those challenges across the two portfolios. We have seen the same in years past. Antenna engineers don\u2019t tend to be connector engineers and vice versa, and that has served us extremely well as we have gone to customers to be able to solve that the comprehensive system problem that they face. Wamsi Mohan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch :  Thanks a lot Adam. R. Adam Norwitt :  Well, thank you very much, Wamsi, and I think we have no further questions. So I would like to just take this opportunity to thank you all again for spending your time with us here today and hope it is not too late to wish that you have at least some degree of rest this summer for all of you on the phone today. And we look forward to talking to you again here in about 3 months. Diana G. Reardon: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day.",

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma'am, you may begin. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon and I am Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we would like to welcome you all to our third quarter earnings call, Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question and answer session. Please note that all the share and per share amounts that we'll discuss today have been adjusted to reflect the company's 2-for-1 stock split that was effective earlier this month. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $1.359 billion and EPS, excluding onetime items of $0.58, achieving strong growth and new records of performance in both sales and earnings per share. Sales were up 18% in US dollars and local currencies compared to Q3 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the quarter were up 11%. Sequentially sales were up 3% in both US dollars and organically from Q2 of 2014, breaking down sales into our two major components. Our cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was flat with last year. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 19% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company's successful acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income, excluding onetime items increased to $270 million in the quarter. Operating margin excluding onetime items, increased to 19.9% compared to 19.7% last year and 19.5% last quarter. The sequential increase of 40 basis points in operating margins over the second quarter represents an excellent conversion margin on incremental sales of over 30%. This strong performance resulted from an increase in operating margins in the interconnect business based on excellent operating execution and cost management on incremental sales volume. From a segment perspective, in the cable business margins were 12.5% down from 12.7% last quarter and 13.8% last year primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In the interconnect business, margins were 22.1%, up from 21.6% last quarter and 22% last year. We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control are a significant contributor to the company's excellent operating performance, ensuring that the company's resources and cost structure are appropriately and quickly adjusted to maximize profitability in what continues to be a dynamic environment. Through the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. The company has recorded acquisition costs in both the current quarter and in last year's third quarter of approximately $2.5 million or $0.01 per share. These costs include professional fees, transaction taxes and other expenses relating to the acquisitions closed in the respective quarters. In accordance with current accounting rules, these costs are expensed as incurred. In addition at this point, we do anticipate approximately $6 million in onetime acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter relating to the valuation of the acquired backlog of the Casco business as is required under U.S. GAAP. These onetime charges will be separately disclosed as is our practice and are not included in our guidance. Interest expense for the quarter was $21 million compared to $16 million last year due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. Other income was $4.7 million in the quarter, up from $3.6 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income on higher levels of cash and short term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% compared to 25.5% last year both excluding onetime items. On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.8% this quarter and approximately 23.9% in last year's third quarter. The 2013 rate included the impact of a net benefit of $3.6 million relating primarily to the completion of prior-year audits. Net income excluding onetime items was approximately 14% of sales in Q3 and EPS before onetime items increased 18% from last year, a very strong performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.342 billion up 17% from last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio in the quarter of approximately 0.99 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and had strong cash flow in the quarter of $224 million or approximately 122% of net income. For the nine months, operating cash flow was $607 million or 117% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventory was $848 million at the end of September, up 2% from June excluding the impact from the Casco acquisition which was closed at the end of the quarter. Inventory days also excluding the acquisition impact, were 80 days down one day from June levels. Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of September, up 3% from June, excluding acquisition impacts. Days sales outstanding was 70 days and consistent with June levels, accounts payable was $600 million at the end of the quarter, up 8% from June levels excluding acquisition impacts and payable days were 56 days, up two days compared to June. The cash flow from operations along with our net proceeds from our senior note offerings of $745 million, cash on hand of $192 million, $41 million in proceeds from stock option exercises were used to purchase 3 million shares of the company's stock during the quarter for $151 million to fund net capital expenditures of $57 million. We funded acquisition payments of $449 million in the quarter relating to the Casco acquisition and repaid $469 million under our revolving credit facility. We also made $71 million in dividend payments during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had 2.9 million shares remaining under its 20 million share stock repurchase program which expires in January of 2015. As previously announced in September, the company completed a $750 million note offering of three and seven-year notes. The notes were issued at 99.9% of their respective face values and have interest rates of 1.55% and 3 1/8% respectively. The company incurred fees of approximately $5 million in connection with the sale. The notes were issued in anticipation of the company's upcoming debt maturity of its $600 million 4.75% notes, which are due in mid-November. At the end of September, our cash and short term investments balance stood at $1.245 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Debt at the end of September was $2.6 billion, bringing net debt to $1.35 billion. At quarter-end, borrowings and availability under the company's $1.5 billion revolving credit facility were $22 million and $1.48 billion respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was $307 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a few comments relative to the guidance. As noted in the press release, we have increased our 2014 guidance by $50 million in sales and $0.03 in earnings at the low end and $30 million in sales and $0.02 in earnings at the high end. The increase in guidance reflects the net positive impact of the addition of the Casco acquisition and a slight increase in organic sales which is partially offset by the translation impact of the significantly stronger dollar. The Casco acquisition that closed at the end of the quarter adds about $55 million in sales and $0.02 in earnings. The negative translation impact caused by the significant strengthening of the dollar towards the end of Q3 in relation to the euro and certain other currencies has the impact of reducing 2014 sales guidance by just under $30 million in sales and a $0.01 in earnings per share. In addition, organic revenue is up about $5 million versus prior guidance with stronger operating execution adding about $0.01 of earnings in the second half versus our prior guidance with Q3 slightly up and Q4 slightly below the prior expectations. Our guidance for 2014 reflects a strong organic growth rate for the year of 7%. I would also just note relative to the Q4 guidance that, from a sequential standpoint at the high end of guidance, sales are up 2% with the Casco acquisition increasing sales by 3% and the negative translation impact from the stronger dollar reducing sales by 1%. From an organic standpoint, Q4 sales are expected to be relatively flat which is down slightly from our prior guidance for Q4 but slightly better, as I mentioned, for the totality of the second half of 2014. The flat sequential organic performance in Q4 results primarily from an expected 18% or so decline sequentially in the mobile network market based on an expected pause in spending in this market in both China and North America after a somewhat stronger than expected Q3. The expected pause in spending in this market in the second half of 2014 is consistent with our prior expectations. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Diana and let me also add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. I'm going to spend a few moments to highlight our achievements in the third quarter. As Diana mentioned, I will then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets and I will just make some short comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. With respect to the third quarter, I can just tell you that we're very pleased to have reported new records in sales and EPS, both of which exceeded the high end of our prior guidance. Sales increased 18% from prior year and 3% sequentially establishing a new record for the company of $1.359 billion in sales. As Diana mentioned, orders also reached a new record of $1.342 billion. We're very proud of our profitability in the quarter, which was very strong as we generated excellent sequential conversion margins leading to an expansion of our already industry-leading operating margin to 19.9%. And with our successful third quarter bond offering, we once again reaffirmed the financial strength of Amphenol. I can just tell you that I'm extremely proud of our global team who once again in the third quarter was able to react quickly to the many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution while continuing to exercise the discipline and drive necessary to achieve outstanding operating performance. Our record results in this third quarter clearly demonstrate the benefits of Amphenol's entrepreneurial culture. As we already announced early in the quarter, we're very pleased to have completed at the end of the quarter the previously announced acquisition of Casco Automotive Group which was completed at the very end of the third quarter. Casco is a global manufacturer of highly engineered, data connectivity, power charging and sensor products to the worldwide automotive market with annual sales of approximately $220 million, a very significant acquisition for us and really one of the three largest that we've made in our history. Importantly, Casco represents a significant new platform for future expansion for the company; in particular as we now have a leading position in automobile in-cabin data and power interconnect as well as an expanded range of sensor products. We are very excited to welcome the outstanding Casco team to Amphenol and we look forward to continuing to create value in the future with our very successful acquisition program. Now turning to the trends in our served markets, I just want to mention that once again, we're very pleased that our balanced and broad end-market diversification supported very clearly the company's strong performance in the third quarter. We're particularly pleased that no single market represented more than 17% of our total sales in the quarter, a great confirmation of the balance across markets that we participate in. Now turning to the individual markets, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased 7% from prior year and 3% from prior quarter on stronger sales of products into military aircraft engine, communications, ordinance and avionics. We're especially encouraged that after essentially six quarters of year-over-year declines in the military market in the third quarter. We were able to deliver strong performance despite continuing downward pressure on overall military budgets. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect demand to continue to grow somewhat from these levels on increased volumes of new programs on which we have higher content. While military budgets overall are clearly not expanding, our technology leadership and broad program participation has enabled us to realize the growth that we experienced in the third quarter and has allowed us to benefit long term from the expanding adoption of electronics and military hardware as well as from stronger spending trends that we see in emerging geographies. The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, sales increased a strong 16% from prior year and declined seasonally as we had expected by roughly 6%. Our year-over-year growth was driven by benefits from last year's Ionix acquisition together with our increasing content on new programs which continue to ramp towards volume production. For the fourth quarter, we expect demand to essentially remain at these levels and we retain a positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2014 and beyond. We're very pleased that we're now realizing the benefits from our long standing efforts to gain position on the latest generation of airliners. As airlines continue to demand planes that are more fuel efficient and that create a better flying experience for the traveling public, aircraft manufacturers are adopting complex, new technologies on their next-generation airliners. This is creating an exciting, long-term opportunity for Amphenol. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. We once again achieved extremely strong sales growth in the industrial market of 44%, driven by contributions from the Advanced Sensors acquisition completed at the end of last year, as well as by a very robust 18% organic growth in the industrial market. In fact, sales increased 3% sequentially in a quarter that would normally be seasonally softer. Our excellent organic growth was driven by strength in the medical, rail mass transit and oil and gas segments in particular which again is a clear confirmation of the value of our diversification strategy across the industrial market. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these high levels and we look forward to continued progress as we broaden our interconnect and sensor technology offering while increasing our penetration of the many exciting growth areas of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased significantly from prior year, growing also by 44% and a very strong 21% organically. As we continue to benefit from the diverse range of new sensor and infotainment automotive products provided by our acquisitions last fourth quarter of Advanced Sensors and Tecvox and as we continue to grow our sales of new products (indiscernible) and emissions management, as well as drivetrain control among other applications. Our sales in the market grew by 3% sequentially even with the impact of a typical third quarter seasonality. We're very proud that we're outgrowing the overall automotive electronics market and really by a wide margin as we're capitalizing on our broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new and complex vehicle electronics. Now with the addition of Casco, we have further expanded our product offering and are positioned in several new high growth applications within the car, including data and power connectivity as well as temperature, sun and rain sensors. Casco also strengthens our position with a diverse set of highly complementary vehicle manufacturers, thereby bolstering our overall position in the automotive, interconnect and sensor market. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect a significant increase from these sales levels as we benefit from the contributions of Casco and we look forward to an overall excellent 2014 and beyond for our rapidly expanding automotive business. The mobile devices market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased as we had expected by a robust 13% from prior year and 14% sequentially, driven by higher demand essentially across all mobile device product types. Once again, our mobile device team was able to quickly flex our production resources to capitalize on increased volume requirements from our customers demonstrating that our organizational agility remains a core advantage of Amphenol in this very dynamic end market. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to grow further from these levels as we benefit from a range of new program launches. We remain confident that, despite the ever-changing landscape in the mobile device market, our leading technology, our preferred supplier relationships with the broadest range of device makers as well as most importantly the excellent execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us well for the future in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and we continue to support significantly higher levels of demand for wireless network build outs in the quarter with sales increasing a stronger than expected 38% from prior year. This was driven by growth in both OEM and service provider sales essentially across all major geographies. While we had anticipated some sequential slowdown in sales going into the third quarter, our sales actually grew slightly from the second quarter. Consistent with our prior expectations of a somewhat lower second half compared to the first half and as Diana mentioned earlier we now expect a roughly 18% sequential reduction of sales in the fourth quarter as operators around the world are planning a moderation of their recently strong build out activities. Regardless of this end-of-the-year pause in activity levels, we're very pleased with our overall performance in the mobile networks market in the full year of 2014 and we remain extremely confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect as well as antenna products. We will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next generation mobile network deployment around the world. We look forward to further building on this excellent platform in the long term. The information technology and data communications market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter, as we had expected, sales decreased by 6% from prior year due to lower levels of sales of products that are incorporated in particular into networking equipment. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly from the second quarter as stronger growth in storage and servers was almost all offset by lower sales of networking related products. Given the continued uncertainties in the IP datacom market in particular related to networking equipment, we do expect a slight moderation of sales in the fourth quarter and we continue to anticipate sales to be slightly down for the full year in this market consistent with our prior guidance. While there are no doubt a great deal of changes occurring in the IT datacom world, we remain encouraged by our industry-leading high speed and power products. Our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers, as well as our enhanced focus on service provider and data center customers all of which are creating a platform for us to outperform in the future in this important market. The broadband market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter and sales declined slightly from prior year on a moderation of spending from U.S., cable operators and were essentially flat to the second quarter. Looking out towards the fourth quarter, we expect a slight reduction in demand which is due to normal year-end seasonality in this space. Although the demand and pricing environment for traditional bulk cable continues to be challenging, we are seeing still the emerging benefits of our product and customer diversification and ultimately. Our future success in this market rests on the company's proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers to support the rapid growth in high speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies. We look forward to maintaining our leading position in the broadband market. So in summary, with respect to the third quarter, I can just tell you very simply put I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as once again we executed so well in a challenging and dynamic market environment. Our performance in 2014 so far has been a clear reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse array of markets, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure. But above all these strengths, our greatest asset remains, our high performance culture that is reinforced every single day by Amphenol's agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to the outlook and Diana has already spoken at length about this, but let me just say that based on stable economic conditions as well as on constant exchange rates including the impact of the relatively weaker overseas currencies that we now see -- we now expect in the fourth quarter and the full year 2014 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $1.341 billion to $1.381 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.260 billion to $5.3 billion for the full year respectively and we expect EPS for the fourth quarter and full year in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 and $2.20 to $2.22 respectively. For the full year, this represents both sales and EPS growth excluding onetime items of a very strong 14% to 15%. We\u2019re very encouraged by our continued strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many uncertainties that are clearly present in the global marketplace. The ongoing revolution in electronics is continuing to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol and I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability and thereby to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol. Thank you very much and at this time operator we would be happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Two questions for me. Maybe to start with Adam, in the press release, you talked about seeing some increased level of uncertainty on a geopolitical basis. I'm actually struggling to understand where in your guide are you factoring this in, other than the mobile networks, which I realize is down a fair amount. But if I look at all the other segments, kind of flat to up a little almost. Can you maybe just talk about where are you seeing these uncertainties? Where do you see a downtick from order pattern across these end markets? Adam Norwitt : First of all, let me say that the level of uncertainty in the marketplace -- we\u2019re not seeing anything different than anybody else is seeing in the newspaper. You read anything and there is certainly a more complex array of incidences and circumstances around the market and I think that's reflected in some of the movements you see in things like exchange rates and interest rates that clearly have moved more significantly in the quarter than anybody would have anticipated three months ago. Look, we give a range for our guidance and we always do that. But, as you know we certainly always strive to get to the top end of that range and that's certainly the goals that we have within the company. But to the extent that we show a range, one could anticipate that if there were greater accelerating problems, that's why we have a low end of such a range and I think it's not necessarily that we're seeing specific things coming from customers but rather that there just appears to be as indicated by some of these movements a greater level of uncertainty around the world and that is whether it is political whether that is economic or whatever that is you see a flight to quality as evidenced in particular by the strength of the dollar and the interest rates today. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : And then just on the mobile devices, you obviously had a nice Q3, but how do we think about the growth in Q4? Because I was looking at the last five years and it's gone from as good as plus 30% to as bad as 20%. I know you said you expect growth, but is there a way to think about what do you think seasonal growth is? Is it low teens again in December and is it more tablet centric or more broad based this time around? Adam Norwitt : Let me just put this in some perspective. We had excellent performance here in the third quarter, growing 13% year-over-year, 14% sequentially and as I mentioned we expect that to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. I think we would expect that kind of (indiscernible) high single-digits sequentially. If you put that in perspective compared to last year, in the second half this year, our growth is essentially going to be somewhere around the low 20% growth second half to first half and that's essentially what we saw also last year. And you may also recall that last year in the fourth quarter, we had a very significant uptick in demand, which was essentially us picking up market share when others could not support the demands of certain new program ramps for customers. So we actually think that our performance this year in mobile devices is very consistent with prior years and very consistent with what we see in the marketplace where you have clearly a wide array of different results and expectations among customers, but our strong growth here across all the product lines that we're participating in. Again to grow by more than 20% second half to first half and to grow in the third quarter by 13% is we think not only consistent, but a very strong reflection of our excellent position in that mobile devices market. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. You may ask your question. Steven Fox - Cross Research : Just backing up on some of the acquisitions that you've done this year Adam, I was curious, especially around the GE business and some of the momentum you're seeing in auto, could you talk about how you've been able to leverage the acquisition into those end markets, how it's translating into organic sales growth now? And then what those deals are doing in terms of adding to earnings for the full year? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, I will talk a little bit about the leverage and then I will let Diana comment to some extent on how those are contributing. But let me just say that we're so happy with the Advanced Sensors acquisition and I think that's the one you mentioned. Obviously, we did five acquisitions last year, four of them completed in the fourth quarter that included Advanced Sensors and Tecvox to name two and we're just very, very pleased in particular with Advanced Sensors. As we've talked about from the day that that company joined Amphenol, it's a fabulous company from numerous respects. Number one, great technology and I think now as we're coming upon soon the first year anniversary of that company joining Amphenol, we feel even stronger about the value of the technology of the company across the range of sensors that they supply because it is a very diversified company. I think the second thing that we talked a lot about was the fact that it is a very diversified company, about 2/3rds of the sales in industrial and 1/3rd in automotive, but within those markets has a very, very diversified array of applications and then customers from medical, heavy equipment to advanced smart building, Internet of Things type applications and then within the car from pressure and temperature, CO2 and all of those type of sensing applications. And all that I can tell you is, again, our great expectations have been really surpassed in terms of the depth that that brings us with the customers. I myself have been to a number of these customers over the course of the year and in each time I go to those customers, you hear a very common refrain and that is that the challenges that the customers are experiencing relative to sensors very frequently revolve around the mechanical interface of the connector and how to integrate that sensor into the interconnect system that then allows that to perform its desired functionality. Again, that was our theory going into it, more than a theory actually that we felt was true, but that has been truly confirmed as we go on. Now let me say things don't happen overnight. Rome was clearly not built in a day in terms of leveraging the typical things that people talk about, synergies and all of that, but we are getting leverage. We're getting leverage at customers who now see us as a broader supplier. We're getting penetration at customers with whom we previously had maybe a smaller presence and today, now we're viewed as a more broad strategic partnership where our access to decision-makers in those customers is greater than it was before and conversely, the Advanced Sensors business gets viewed now under -- in the kind of patina of an Amphenol who is known as a powerful and leading component supplier as opposed to sort of a company within a big conglomerate like a GE that really was viewed as an adjunct to their core business. And I think all of that together has acted to create really a truly fabulous first year and the honeymoon has certainly not ended yet for us in Advanced Sensors. Diana Reardon : And Steven, in terms of the impact of the acquisitions on a year-over-year basis, if we look at the high end of guidance, our sales growth is expected to be about 15%. About 8% or so is the contribution from the acquisition program on the top line and I would say it's a little bit less than that from a bottom-line perspective, but certainly a very strong contribution all the way around from the program in 2014. Steven Fox - Cross Research : Then just a quick follow-up. In terms of two of the markets, auto and industrial, and I think you touched on this a little bit in just what you talked about, Adam, but those two markets seem to be drawing more attention relative to some of the geopolitical concerns in Europe. Can you just give us a base case for how you see those markets right now and whether you're more concerned about end demand or how maybe you're able to overcome it a little bit more given some of these acquisitions? Thanks a lot. Adam Norwitt : Again, thank you very much. I think relative to Europe, clearly, I've been in Europe a couple times in the last month and you don't want to read the paper if you want to have a smile on your face. But I can tell you that our team has executed fabulously in Europe and in fact, if I look at our performance by region, truly in local currency and organically, however you want to look at it, Europe was actually our fastest-growing region in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So clearly, the Amphenol team is not putting their head in the sand after reading every morning the Financial Times or Le Monde or Der Spiegel or whatever that is going to be. So I think from that standpoint, we are doing outstanding in that space compared to what the overall macro is performing. And I think there's no doubt about it; our strength in industrial and automotive, as well as in commercial air, which is another space where we do have more business in Europe and mobile infrastructure, our teams there have just done an outstanding job at executing on the opportunities at hand and then refocusing the resources towards those places where there is growth opportunity because regardless of what happens in the macro environment, the electronics revolution is continuing without missing a beat. You've just got to find where that is and I think our ongoing strategy of diversification, in particular in the industrial market, the automotive market, I mean these are areas where we're constantly plumbing for new places where technology is taking hold and not trying to take share from others, but trying to enable something that is new. And I think that has been really the recipe that we have followed. In Europe, we follow it obviously on a global basis, but I think the impact of it compared to the macro indicators is certainly magnified in Europe to the positive for Amphenol. Operator : Your next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Please ask your question. James Kisner - Jefferies: I'm just wondering again about mobile devices. Obviously, there was some very strong demand at some large OEMs recently and perhaps even a surprise in mix shift towards larger phones at one major OEM. I'm just wondering if you could comment on leadtime or supply chain dynamics, mobile devices. Is there any potential for double ordering, tightness in supply chain and perhaps also what are the key puts and takes that we might think about entering into Q1 seasonality? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Let me answer the last part, which is it's too early to say about Q1. I think we're not in a position yet, especially in a market like mobile devices, where visibility is not necessarily the longest in that space. I can't tell you that we have seen ourselves any double ordering or tightening of supply chain. Obviously, we're making certain products, antennas and interconnect products and we certainly ourselves don't have any tightening of our supply chains and we are more than able to satisfy very quickly our customers. And that has been a real hallmark and a benchmark of Amphenol for a long time. Again, I mentioned earlier in the call, last year in the fourth quarter when we had sort of a real unexpected uptick in demand and we were able to do that really flawlessly when our competitors were not. So I think from that standpoint, we are not stretching leadtimes. We are not a bottleneck and to the extent that customers can take more, we will be there to support them with that. Otherwise, what other components are doing relative to that, I can't tell you that I have great visibility on it. Operator : Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Amitabh Passi - UBS: Diana, my first question was for you. I was curious how are you thinking about OpEx into the calendar fourth quarter, particularly now with the integration of Casco? Diana Reardon : Sure. I think that you probably saw in the financials in Q3 that we had a good performance in terms of operating costs or SG&A in Q3 and they've now come kind of back down to the level they were at last year at that time. We had some increase in the first quarter when the Advanced Sensors acquisition came in as they were running at a higher level, but I think they've started to manage some of those expenses down. I think as we look into Q4, I would expect kind of a normal Amphenol pattern where we would see less SG&A growth from a percentage standpoint than we would see in sales growth. And I think that the Casco acquisition has a cost structure that I would say more mirrors our own, so I wouldn't expect any significant impact there. Amitabh Passi - UBS: Okay. And it seems like the last couple of quarters you've had an attractive conversion margin of greater than 30%. I'm just wondering do you think that's sustainable over the next couple of quarters, particularly as you continue to integrate and optimize the sensors business or do you think you revert back towards the mid-20%s target? I'm just trying to get some rough sense of how we think about what you're seeing in conversion margins, which has been quite attractive the last couple of quarters. Diana Reardon : Sure. I guess I would say two things. One is our long-term goal is still 25% and to your point, we have been doing better than that the last couple of quarters. There have been a number of factors contributing to that. Certainly very good operating execution across the company. I think in this quarter, we'll also start to see some impact as the acquisitions come closer to the average of the company, so we have a lot of good strong contributions going on there. I think that when you look at Q4, the sales volume, as I said when I walked through the guidance in the prepared remarks, the incremental sequential sales growth is really coming from the Casco acquisition with some offset from the foreign currency translation. So as we look there, we wouldn't expect, because of the components of the sales change, for that to be at that high conversion margin level. We would expect more ROS in Q4 to probably be closer to that Q3 level.  And as we look into next year and give guidance for next year when we close the fourth quarter, I think we will talk more about what to expect at that point. But I think I can tell you that our 25% conversion margin goal certainly still remains the goal for the management team. Operator : Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. Please ask your question. Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research : The first just being on mobile networks, it looks that the absolute dollar level of sales for this year is probably in line with maybe where you previously guided. It's just the shape of the back half is different. Is that true? And second, within that is it just a pause in spending? Did you see was it more of a pull-ahead, and does this in any way impact your view on 2015 and what could be another good year for the mobile networks business in 2015? Adam Norwitt : I think you correctly characterize if we think about how we had guided to the mobile infrastructure market going forward, we had said that we would expect the market to be somewhat down in the second half compared to the first half. Our Q3 sales were a little bit higher than expected, and thus I think the fourth quarter is maybe a little bit more of a drop-off than we would have expected coming from the third quarter. But if you look at it, first half to second half based on our outlook, it would be down 1% or 2% in the second half to the first half, which I think on any industry comparable basis is a very, very strong performance. And when we think about the performance this year, we expect still to be up in that market and kind of the mid-20% range. Again, very, very strong performance and much stronger than you see in kind of the OEM reports that are available and I think it compares very favorably on any peer basis. What does that mean, the fourth quarter relative to looking out into next year? We have not given guidance about next year, but I don't think that our change in guidance here would change any degree our outlook long term in the market. We have an outstanding position. I think one thing that has been very favorable for us this year has been that regardless of what spending happens, we have demonstrated this year to our customers that when they need us, we are there for them. With very strong upticks in demand -- you may recall in the second quarter, we had just an outstanding second-quarter sequential growth, somewhere close to I believe 20% quarter-to-quarter and to react so quickly as we were able to do when our customers needed it, that is something that they don't forget going forward. In particular in this market where oftentimes you're not talking about factories, you're talking really about crews in the field waiting for parts. And you don't want to be the guy who is holding those crews up in the field waiting for parts and we have never been and in fact, we've just executed so well in that strong growth this year that whatever happens in the overall spending market, I think our position and our ability to capture more than our fair share of that going forward has been very much confirmed this year and will create a great platform for us in the future. Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research : Okay and then a brief follow-up. It's not part shortages holding anything up right now and then just on Casco, that $0.02 of accretion for the fourth quarter, should we expect that to normalize to maybe like a $0.03 plus range as we head into 2015 per quarter? Adam Norwitt : I'll answer about -- there was not a parts shortage, if that's what you're asking relative to mobile devices. There's no impact. It's just in the quarter we see somewhat less buildout activity and I'll let Diana talk about Casco. Diana Reardon : Sure. I think that the $0.02 in the fourth quarter is within a margin of what we would expect to see in 2015. I think we're not giving guidance for next year yet and we don't ordinarily specifically call out EPS contribution from individual acquisitions. I did it in this case; I thought it would be helpful because we had a lot of moving parts in the guidance. But I don't think the $0.02 would be misrepresentative of the level that we would see next year. Operator : Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : I think that you, or maybe, Adam, you said that growth in the fourth quarter on an organic basis is probably about flat. I wanted to understand if that is more sort of a timing issue. I think you said for the full year you expect to grow revenue about 7% on an organic basis, but wanted to think about your views of organic growth going forward and if you still think you can grow 2X the market? Diana Reardon : Sure. Maybe just to say the numbers and then maybe Adam can talk about the growth versus the market, but that flat organic growth I was talking about was the sequential performance between Q3 and Q4. If we look at, on a year-over-year basis, which is what the 7% for the full-year is year-over-year, in the fourth quarter from an organic standpoint is somewhere in the sort of the 3% range and it is somewhat impacted by the fact that while the mobile device market is growing sequentially between Q3 and Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we did have a huge fourth quarter in 2013 for the reasons that Adam already described and so that does have some impact in terms of the year-over-year organic growth discreetly in the fourth quarter. Adam Norwitt : And Sherri, relative to our target and history, long history of outperforming the market and really growing at 2 times the market, we continue to have a great degree of conviction around our ability to do that and we believe not only do we have the ability, but we've really built the platform to do that going forward. Ultimately what is the market growing, that we'll only be able to assess when the dust has settled on 2014. But I think this year our performance is really outstanding given this guidance that we have and we continue to look forward to pursuing and achieving on that 2 times the market goal going forward. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : And then, Diana, you gave some detail on the impact of the stronger dollar relative to foreign currencies in the fourth quarter and just wanted to understand how much will that continue into 2015 and is it sort of the same magnitude as the fourth quarter? Thanks. Diana Reardon : Sure. When we would look at 2015, if rates stay roughly where they are, we would expect it could be something like a 1% year-over-year drag from a translation perspective if that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Please ask your question. William Stein - SunTrust: One question and one follow-up, first, I want to just ask a follow-up on the wireless infrastructure business. There has been pretty widespread understanding that there have been some component shortages, not from Amphenol, but in the RF power amp area that have caused some other companies to have kind of inconsistent results in this market. So I'm wondering if you see this as more of a pause in buildout by the carriers or is this an inventory adjustment by the equipment vendors and then I had a balance sheet question as well. Adam Norwitt : It's very true. I think in the first half of the year, there were these component shortages and you correctly point out I mean what we hear also related to RF power amps in particular. I don't know whether there were others, but the RF power amp was certainly something that was widely discussed in the industry. And I think we talked about last quarter and even before that, because of that, we probably would have anticipated this year the second half to be even more down compared to the first half. But they were not able, many of our customers, to truly get the build rates of the base stations up because they didn't have these -- they were missing these components. And I think, from that perspective, that's one of the factors that allows -- in our second half, we're down only really by about 1% or 1.5% compared to the first half. Otherwise that could have been a more significant falloff in demand as there really was quite a wave of buildout happening that was intended at least to happen in the first half. None of those -- I have not heard recently that those component shortages are continuing. I think there's a relatively normal degree of demand. Whether there was double ordering of those components or whatnot, I mean we're not close enough to really judge. Now one thing to understand is we're shipping -- some portion of our business in mobile infrastructure goes to OEMs, but another portion and really a roughly equal size goes direct to service providers. And so when we're selling to service providers, you don't really have inventory corrections per se. That's much more in a real, almost just-in-time delivery where they say we're going to have a crew there in a week and we need your parts there also on that same week. And from that standpoint, you don't get those inventory bubbles that you can get more related to a traditional OEM manufacturing process. William Stein - SunTrust: And the follow-up, maybe, Diana, for you, capital expenditures as a percent of revenue has been a bit elevated and it was again this quarter and I'm wondering if that's related to Sidney. I thought that that had been already kind of resolved and built out. Maybe there's something else going on. Thank you. Diana Reardon : Sure. Actually you're correct; it has been higher for the last few quarters. And in this third quarter, there was the last of the spending relating to the project that you mentioned where we were building a new facility to replace the flood-damaged one from a couple years back. So we have been spending more at 4% of sales over the last few quarters in order to accommodate that additional spending. We would expect the spending to come down in the fourth quarter to a more normal level and would expect the same as we move into 2015 and that normal level would be somewhere in the 3%, 3.5% of sales range. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please ask your question. Jim Suva - Citi: Adam and Diana, to you and your team there at Amphenol. When we look at your recent acquisitions, I think it's fair to say they're kind of going as an extension, so to speak, beyond your traditional cable and connector business when we start talking about sensors and all this. And then when we did some work looking at the industry of sensors, it actually looks like sensors are more profitable than traditional connectors. So is it fair to say that there is a chance that these recent acquisitions could actually be accretive to your companywide margins and if not, maybe is there something wrong with my logic or what I see in the sensor industry versus connectors? Adam Norwitt : I think it's very true. I mean we have been, over the last essentially three years, we've now made 11 acquisitions and of those, two of them have a sensor component. One was the Advanced Sensors business that we acquired close to a year ago, which was exclusively sensors and then we acquired here Casco, which has a sensor productline, as well as their interconnect productline. I think the sensor market is for us one that we feel very good about because of its wonderful leverage that you can get between the sensor and the interconnect product, combined with its great diversification. Much as we love so much the diversification of the interconnect market, we feel the same way about the diversification within the sensor market. Now are sensors by definition more profitable than connectors? I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think there have been examples in the sensor industry of some who make more money and some who make less. I think when we acquired the Advanced Sensors business, we did talk about the fact that, at the time we acquired it, that company was operating at a level that was meaningfully below our corporate average and that we certainly had the aspiration and the goal to bring it up to our corporate average over time. Is there something empirically different about sensors that means you can make more money than connectors? I don't know that that is true, but I do know that there's certainly at least the equal opportunity to make great returns in the sensor market because, at the end of the day, we're able to make our fabulous returns into the interconnect market by enabling the technologies of our customers, by creating for them something that ultimately makes their system perform better, either have a better performance, be able to sell more of them, get a better marketshare, whatever they can do with their end equipment. And I think sensors have very much the same property to them. You embed technology in the sensors and that is either with the sensing element or very interestingly you embed the technology in the packaging of the interconnect. And by embedding that technology, which creates value for the end customer, you're thereby able to charge a price that allows you to make a fair return on that business. And so to that standpoint, we certainly feel that the sensor market has at least as good of an opportunity to make the returns that we like to make and we'll see over time whether it's better than we think. Jim Suva - Citi: And a quick follow-up for Diana. Diana, for currency changes, is it mostly like the euro or the yen or what particular denomination should we be most mindful of because someday down the road, I'm sure currencies will change a little bit again? Diana Reardon : Sure. The euro would be the biggest one that would have an impact on us. Others have some impact as well, but they are smaller. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please ask your question. Mike Wood - Macquarie: In terms of going back to automotive. 21% organic growth is very impressive and significant outgrowth. You've called out some synergies from Advanced Sensors. My understanding of the automotive business, there's typically very long leadtimes to get on programs before you actually get those synergies. Can you talk about how you're getting them so quickly and with Casco, would that be the similar type of immediate synergies? Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much. I think, again, we're very pleased with this 21% organic growth. I don't think I attributed that growth necessarily to these so-called synergies between the sensors and the connectors. Even if we have actually started to see some early opportunities a little bit even quicker than we expected them to leverage a connector in a sense or in a single application, but clearly that's not the main driver or even a significant driver of the 21% growth. The 21% growth is really coming from new applications in the car and when we look at these applications -- again, I mentioned a few -- emissions, telematics, drivetrain control, things like antilock braking. Essentially where ever you see in a car new electronic functionality that maybe was not there in the past, those are the type of systems that are really creating this outsized growth for us. So again, this is not us just capturing a marketshare from an incumbent on something that is there already; it is us working long term, and this is over many, many years of effort to work to design in on new applications, as you correctly point out, over a relatively long cycle time and you see those new programs and those new functionalities and those new feature sets in the car starting to roll out. And I think the one thing that I would say is that the automakers around the world, they have clearly woken up to the fact that electronics helps them make money, number one and sell more cars, number two. And so I think that cycle of implementation of electronics into cars -- if anything, that cycle is compressing to a shorter cycle than the traditional sort of platform cycles that you see in the automotive industry. You have really what I would almost call mid-platform upgrades that happen on things like lighting systems and infotainment systems and otherwise, new things like LEDs in the car and all of that. I think these are all the areas where our team is heavily focused both in the short and the long term to make sure that we're participating at more than our fair share of those applications. Mike Wood - Macquarie: Great. And just to be thorough, the only area I don't think we discussed is just the decline recently into metals like silver and gold to a lesser extent. Can you comment on what you'd expect to happen on the pricing erosion side going forward? Diana Reardon : From a pricing erosion standpoint, I think that we put the guidance together based on the costs that we see at the particular time. I think as we've talked before, we do certainly a great job from an operating management standpoint to maximize overall profitability in the company and that's the combination of managing sales price and then managing cost and from a cost perspective, the current environment is certainly better relative to the trends in commodities than what we've seen in a few of the prior years, but we certainly wouldn't expect any particular windfall from any specific metal. The company uses a lot of different metals, a lot of different plastics and I think does a very good job of really getting the most bang for the buck from a profitability perspective. And I think you've seen two really strong quarters of excellent conversion margin here during 2014. We hit 19.9% ROS in the quarter and so we're really very pleased with the profitability performance of the company and the team is very committed as we look out into the future to continuing to work towards a 25% conversion margin goal and certainly good procurement practices is part of that, but there are many different factors that go into achieving that kind of profitability at the end of the day. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs : I was hoping you could help me understand the reason for the softness in the networking portion of your IT segment and then how we should think about that as we go into 2015. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much. I think -- I talked about the fact that in the IT datacom market, there is clearly a lot of dislocation happening and change happening in that market. And I'm sure you know as well as I do some of the macro factors that are happening there, the rise of data centers and web service providers, the challenges that many companies are facing in other markets, including places, for example, like China where, for a wide range of call them political considerations, certain legacy suppliers are having more trouble to sell in particular their core networking equipment into those spaces. And so for whatever reason it is, I think there has clearly been some moderation of the sales of these networking equipment. But, look, at the end of the day, that is not going to be a perpetual situation because those are the equipment, this networking equipment and the IT, which is really forming the backbone of the Internet and the data rates that are going, that we see, the expansion of data rates that we see in our server and our storage business and that we see in particular with these new LTE and 3G networks that are being built up over the course of -- in the wireless market, these things are creating tremendous end demand for data that ultimately is going to flow through these core networks and through the switches and the routers and all of those things that drive the core networks. And ultimately will create let me just call it more of a pent-up demand for that equipment. It actually reminds me somewhat of -- for a number of years, we saw, in the mobile infrastructure market, not great spending trends and over that time, there was that pent-up demand that grew and grew and ultimately developed into real demand. And whether that will happen in networking equipment and whether there will be that kind of real demand that comes as a result of this pent-up demand, that I can't tell you and I can't certainly predict what is the timing of that. But I think the empirical requirements of data on the network, those are not changing. And now it relates to us, and if I look at our position and our position really on a global basis with customers who are creating that next-generation networking equipment, we have a position that is truly second to none. And that starts with our high-speed products and those high-speed products, which are really enabling the highest level of data transport through these systems. It goes to our power products. It goes to our fiber optics and others and the real broad suite of products that we supply into high-end IT datacom, no doubt about it, even if there is that kind of pause this year in that -- due to the changes that are happening in that market, our position long term with our high technology products is really second to none. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs : I appreciate the context there. For a follow-up question, I'm hoping you can help me think about the capital allocation strategy going forward. This year, the company has done some larger acquisitions in GE, Advanced Sensors, in Casco. You also stepped up the buyback a little bit this quarter and did the nice job buying back 3 million shares. Should we expect going forward that the company is planning to be a little bit more aggressive on the capital allocation strategy there in terms of the size of the potential companies you may tuck in or the way you're thinking about doing the buyback or is this just you had a couple of larger deals that came to fruition as you executed upon those? Diana Reardon : Look, I think the company has had a very consistent strategy for many years relative to the deployment of the financial strength and the prioritization there clearly is towards the acquisition program, which we believe provides the company with the best long-term return both from a growth and profitability perspective. We do also though feel that a balance is important and I think whether or not you look at the last five years, you look at this year, you look at last year, I think what you see is really quite some balance if you would look at the free cash flow of the company with about half going back to shareholders in various forms and the other half being deployed towards the acquisition program. I think as Adam has said on many occasions, the size of the acquisitions is not really the important criteria as far as we're concerned; it's much more about the fit from a technology standpoint, about the strength of the management team, about the potential that we see for both top and bottom-line growth. So we would certainly, if there was an appropriate acquisition that fit all of those criteria that was bigger, that would be something that we would prioritize that financial strength towards because, as I said before, we do feel as a management team that that's what makes the most sense for the company. So I think what you'll see us continue to do as we look into the future is to continue to have a balanced approach, but certainly to err on the side of funding the acquisition program as those opportunities present themselves. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call back over to the speakers. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much and I'd like to thank all of you for spending some time with us today on what is here in New England a blustery fall day and we certainly appreciate all of your attention and I hope it's not too early as we will not speak to you until next year to wish all of you a great holiday season and a successful fourth quarter. Thank you again and we'll talk to you in January. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. Have a nice day.",

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain on the listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Diana Reardon : Thank you. My name is Diana Reardon and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. Q4 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We will then have a question-and-answer session. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $1.427 million and EPS excluding one-time items of $0.63 beating the high-end of the company\u2019s guidance and achieving new records of performance in both sales and earnings per share. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to Q4 of 2013. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in Q4 were up 7%. From a sequential standpoint, sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from Q3. Breaking down sales into our two major components : our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales was up 3% from last year; our interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales was up 15% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year, sales were $5.346 billion, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically over 2013, a very strong performance. Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased to $288 million in the quarter. Operating margin also excluding one-time items increased to 20.2% in Q4 compared to 19.7% last year and 19.9% last quarter. This represents the third consecutive quarter of ROS improvement in 2014. The sequential increase of 30 basis points in operating margin over the third quarter and the achievement in the quarter of a new record ROS of 20.2% resulted from an increase in operating margins in our interconnect business. From a segment perspective, in the cable segment, margins were 12.1%, down from 12.5% last quarter and 12.2% last year primarily due to the impact of market pricing and some impact from product mix. In our interconnect business, margins increased to 22.4%, up 30 basis points from last quarter and 60 basis points from last year. We are very, very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement both with the full year achievement of 19.6%, excluding one-time items, which reflects the impact earlier in 2014 of the lower than average profitability level of certain acquisitions and in particular with a consistent quarterly improvement and profitability during the year culminating in the achievement of 20.2% ROS in Q4. The improvement in ROS achieved consistently during the year reflects excellent operating execution both organically and in our acquisition program in addition to aggressive cost management. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what certainly continues to be a very dynamic environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. The company recorded one-time charges of $10 million or $0.02 per share in the quarter, which include the amortization of the value associated with acquired backlog relating to the Casco acquisition completed in the third quarter and also acquisition-related transaction costs. The company also recorded acquisition cost in last year\u2019s fourth quarter of $3 million or $0.01 per share. The acquisition related costs include professional fees, transaction taxes and other external expenses relating to the acquisitions closed in the respective time periods. Interest expense for the quarter was $20 million compared to $16 million last year due to higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs. From a sequential standpoint, interest expense in the fourth quarter declined about $1 million from Q3 to Q4 and will further decline by another $3 million or so in Q1 2015 due to a reduction in the company\u2019s average effective interest rate. The lower average rate is a result of the new note issuance in September replacing a higher cost note maturity in November and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income in the quarter was $5.2 million, up from $3.9 million last year primarily as a result of higher interest income and higher levels of cash and short-term cash investments. The company\u2019s effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.4% compared to 26.3% last year both excluding one-time items. For the full year also excluding one-time items the rates were 26.5% and 26.3% in 2014 and 2013 respectively. On an as reported basis the company\u2019s effective tax rate was approximately 26.2% in Q4 2014 and 26.5% for the full year 2014 compared to 26.2% and 24.6% for the respective 2013 time periods. The full year 2013 included the impact of a net income tax benefit of $3.6 million or $0.01 per share relating primarily to the completion of prior year audits. In addition, it also included an income tax benefit of $11 million or $0.03 per share resulting from the reinstatement on January 2, 2013 of certain federal income tax provisions relating primarily to research and development and U.S. taxes on foreign income. Our 2015 guidance incorporates an effective tax rate excluding one-time items of 26.5%. Net income excluding one-time items was approximately 14% of sales in the quarter and earnings per share also before one-time items increased a strong 19% to $0.63 in Q4. For the full year 2014 EPS excluding one-time items was $2.25, up 17% over last year, an excellent performance. Orders for the quarter were $1.427 billion, up 15% from last year resulting in a book to bill ratio of about 1-to-1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and we had very strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. Cash flow is $273 million or 140% of net income. For the full year operating cash flow was $881 million and 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. The company had good working capital management during the quarter. Inventories stood at $866 million at the end of the year, up 2% from September. Inventory days were 79 days, down one day from both September 2014 and December 2013 levels. Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of the year, up about 3% from September. Day sales outstanding was 71 days, up one day from September 2014 and December 2013 and accounts payable was $618 million, up about 3% from September and from the days perspective was 57 days, up one day compared to both September and prior December levels. The strong cash flow from operations along with net proceeds from our commercial paper program of $671 million and $12 million of stock option proceeds were used primarily to purchase $139 million of the company\u2019s stock to fund $46 million of capital expenditures and $50 million of acquisition payments relating to the December acquisition of Goldstar to fund the November maturity of the company\u2019s 4.75, $600 million 5-year notes and to repay $22 million under the company\u2019s revolving credit facility. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of about $96 million in the quarter. During the quarter the company repurchased 2.9 million shares under its January 2013, 20 million share stock buyback program. This completed the authorization under that program and the Board of Directors has authorized a new 2-year, 10 million stock share repurchase program that commences this month. At the end of the year, cash and short-term investments were $1.33 billion. The majority of which is held outside the U.S. Our total debt stood at $2.67 billion bringing net debt to $1.34 billion. And as we previously disclosed in September of this year, the company established a new $1.5 billion commercial paper program that\u2019s supported by the company\u2019s $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. And at quarter end, the company had issued $671 million in commercial paper under the program. EBITDA in the quarter was $330 million bringing the full year EBITDA to $1.2 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Diana and I\u2019d like to offer my welcome to all of you on the phone and hopefully it\u2019s not too late to wish you as well a Happy New Year here in January. As Diana mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements during the fourth quarter and the full year and then I will spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress across our various served markets. Finally, I will make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter as well as for the full year of 2015. Turning to the fourth quarter, I think as Diana just reviewed, the fourth quarter was an excellent quarter for the company in virtually all respects. As we exceeded the high-end of our guidance while setting new records in sales and earnings, our revenue increased a very strong 15% from prior year and 5% sequentially reaching the record level of $1.427 billion. And the company similarly booked a record $1.427 billion in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of exactly 1-to-1. Diana also highlighted that we reached in the quarter the highest levels of profitability in the company\u2019s history with our operating margins expanding 50 basis points from prior year to 20.2%, a great achievement by any benchmark. We are also very pleased that our Board of Directors has approved the 10 million share stock buyback program that we announced today, which follows the completion of our January 2013 program. What I can just say with respect to the fourth quarter and for the year, I am extremely proud of our team. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of the discipline as well as the agility of Amphenol\u2019s entrepreneurial organization. We continue to capitalize on the many available opportunities for growth, while also driving superior operating performance. We also made great progress in our acquisition program in the fourth quarter with the acquisition of Goldstar Electric Systems, which was completed during the month of December. Goldstar is a China-based manufacturer of high technology interconnect assemblies for the industrial heavy equipment industry. And the company has facilities in two important new locations in China and has annual revenues of approximately $40 million. There is no question that the addition of Goldstar strengthens what is already a very robust presence that we have in the China industrial market and provides a great complement to our already fast growing industrial interconnect business. We are especially pleased that the entire management team of Goldstar has joined Amphenol and I personally look forward to them driving continued growth in the company for many years to come. This acquisition is very consistent with our ongoing successful strategy to acquire complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and an excellent market presence. And as we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future. I\u2019d like to make a couple of comments just about the full year of 2014. And I think we can say very simply that 2014 was an outstanding year for the company. As we grew strongly while establishing new records in sales and earnings, we expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 16% to a new record $5.346 billion. And we did that while generating EPS of $2.25, a growth of 17% from prior year and achieving 19.6% operating margins. We are also very pleased to have created further value with our acquisition program in 2014 with the important acquisitions of Casco and then Goldstar, which we just announced. These fine companies are significant additions to Amphenol, which further expand our position in the automotive, interconnect and sensors market as well as in the industrial interconnect market. It is our consistent focus across Amphenol on growing with the broadening array of customers across the many diversified end markets that has resulted in us strengthening our position across the Board in the electronics industry. In addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative-interconnect technologies in support of our clear long-term mission which is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for the company for our future growth. So as we close 2014, I can just say that we are confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which the company can drive even stronger performance into the future. Now, turning to the trends in our served markets, I just want to comment that once again in the quarter our diversification across these end markets remains one of the greatest assets of the company with no market representing more than 17% of our sales for the full year 2014. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the military market increased 3% from prior year driven by growth in military vehicle communications and airframe applications and grew 2% sequentially. For the full year 2014 our sales were up slightly and that is despite what have been very well reported reductions in overall military spending in many Western countries. We are pleased to have seen some stabilization that demand environment in particular in the United States defense market, but while we do not expect any significant rebounds in overall spending and while world events continue to create uncertainty around these global spending patterns, we are confident that our position remains strong. The increasing electronic content in military equipment together with our broad program participation and strong positions in high-growth emerging markets have created good platforms for future growth. While we expect a slight moderation of sales going into the first quarter, for the full year 2014 we do anticipate a modest increase in sales from these levels as we benefit from the ramp up of new programs as well as from our new designs on next generation military equipment. The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year of 2014. Sales increased a very strong 6% from prior year and actually 8% organically as we continued to capitalize on increased demand resulting from higher production levels of next generation jetliners on which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales grew by 4% from the seasonally lower third quarter. And as we look back at the full year of 2014, our sales grew strongly rising from 2013 by 18% including acquisitions and 10% organically clearly outperforming the overall market for jetliners. We are very pleased with our continued progress in the commercial air market. As we have taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next generation jetliners which we are enabling with our high-technology interconnect products. Looking forward, we expect sales to essentially remain at roughly these levels in the first quarter, but we continue to have a positive outlook for the commercial air market in 2015 and beyond as production volumes continued to ramp up and as new platforms launch thereby creating an exciting long-term opportunity for Amphenol. The industrial market represented 16% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year of 2014, effectively one of our two largest markets in the year. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 35% on a year-over-year basis. And this was driven in particular by growth in the medical, heavy equipment and oil and gas segments together with contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed during the course of the past year. On a sequential basis our sales were slightly lower than prior quarters, demand moderated seasonally in several segments of the industrial market. For the full year of 2014 we are just very pleased with this market where sales grew by an extremely strong 44% as we benefited from the acquisition of advanced sensors as well as strong 14% organic growth in the worldwide industrial market. We are very pleased with our outstanding progress this year in this market. Our expansion within the many growth segments of the market including medical, heavy equipment, oil and gas as well as factory automation has been complemented by a successful extension into sensors as well as our continued development of high-technology interconnect products. The addition of Goldstar here in the fourth quarter represents yet another step forward in our successful expansion in particular within the high-growth China industrial market. While we have seen some recent slowing in certain segments of the industrial market, including in particular the oil and gas area. Looking ahead, we expect sales to remain stable in the first quarter. And we have continued to look forward to a strong year in the industrial market in 2015 as we benefit from the Goldstar acquisition as well as from our continued progress at diversification to the many exciting segments of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the fourth quarter and represented 15% of our sales for the full year of 2014. Sales increased an excellent and higher than expected 62% from prior year and 24% sequentially. Organic growth in the quarter was a very, very strong 21% year-over-year and 5% sequentially really strong by any measure. This significant year-over-year growth was driven by ongoing ramp-ups of new high technology programs as well as generally higher vehicle production volumes combined with the significant benefits from both the Advanced Sensors and Casco acquisitions that we have completed over the course of last year. For the full year of 2014, we are very pleased as we have achieved excellent growth of 49% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically for the total of 2014. No question that these results reflect our success in our drive to expand our interconnect and now sensor product offering into new vehicles around the world and we look forward to further capitalizing on the accelerating revolution of automotive electronics in the future. Our expanded product offering now extends to many exciting areas of the market from hybrid and electric drives to safety and security, telematics and infotainment, exhaust management and engine control and transmission and braking, all areas which positioned us strongly for future growth in the automotive market. For the first quarter, we anticipate a moderate increase in sales compared to fourth quarter and a more than 30% increase in U.S. dollars and 45% increase in local currencies compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter. For the full year 2015, we expect strong double-digit growth in this market as we realized the benefits of the Casco acquisition as well as of our very successful expansion of the range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed. The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2014. Our sales increased by stronger-than-expected 4% from prior year on increased sales of products sold into smartphones and smartphone accessories as well as laptops, which more than offset a reduction in tablet-related sales. Sequentially, we grew a very strong 21% from the third quarter again on increased sales of smartphones and accessories as well as some sequential increase in tablet sales. This was another excellent demonstration of our team\u2019s ability to quickly react and to flex our manufacturing capacity to increase customer demand, no doubt, a critical asset in this very dynamic market. For the full year 2014, sales increased by 5%, which certainly represented better performance than we had anticipated coming into the second half of the year. We are confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever dynamic mobile device market and remain encouraged by our excellent technology position across the wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality is being integrated into an ever broader array of devices thereby expanding the growth opportunity for both our interconnect as well as antenna products. Looking into the first quarter, we do expect a roughly 25% sequential reduction in sales due to normal seasonality combined with the impact from strong ramp-ups of new products in the fourth quarter. Just want to note that this is very similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced coming into the first quarter of this last year 2014. At this point, we expect sales for the full year of 2015 to remain roughly at these 2014 levels as increases in products sold into smartphones and accessories as well as laptops are offset by expected reductions in sales related to tablet computers. Regardless of the overall demand environment though, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic, agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year and sales grew again strongly from prior year expanding by 13% on growth in products sold both into wireless OEMs as well as direct to wireless service providers. As expected, sales declined sequentially by 19% as operators around the world moderated their spending from their earlier high levels of investment. No question that 2014 was an excellent year for our team working in the mobile networks market as they were able to capitalize on the expanded build-outs around the world growing our sales by a very strong 24% from prior year, all organic. Our clear outperformance of the overall wireless market this year is a great affirmation of the strength of both our broad-interconnect as well as antenna technologies combined with our excellent position with OEM and operator customers around the world. Based on the latest information we have from those customers and looking out into the first quarter and beyond we do expect a further moderation of sales in the first quarter. And at this time we anticipate a slight reduction in our sales to the mobile networks market for 2015 as operators digest the significant investments that were made in 2014. But regardless, we remain very well positioned in this market due to our broad design and positions on new base station platforms as well as our strong presence with a diverse range of global wireless operators. The information technology and data comm market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year of 2014 and very pleased that this market performed better than expected in the fourth quarter as our sales decreased by only a very slight amount from prior year as expected moderations of demand in networking equipment more than offset growth in the storage related products and servers. Our sales increased actually by 3% sequentially on the strengthening of sales of our products incorporated into both networking as well as storage equipment. No question that 2014 was a challenging year in the IT data comm market as the overall market experienced significant dynamics and one could even say disruptions. As a result growth in storage and servers that we did achieve was more than offset by declines in networking equipment sales and thus our total sales declined slightly for the year. Nevertheless, despite those market dynamics we made tremendous progress this year in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our initiative to penetrate the many newly arising Web 2.0 and datacenter customers. Regardless of the many structural changes in this market, all of our IT customers are pushing their equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data, which is driven in particular by new mobile devices and by the continuing spread of video on the Internet as well as by the acceleration of cloud-based computing. While we expect a further seasonal moderation of IT data comm demand in the first quarter, we do anticipate this market to return to growth in 2015. And we are excited by the potential of these new technologies together with our accelerating progress with new datacenter customers. The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 7% of our sales for the full year 2014. Sales in this market decreased slightly from prior year and by roughly 5% sequentially as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed to the traditional seasonality. For the full year, our sales moderated slightly from 2013 as growth in our new products as well as with non-traditional customers was offset by overall reductions in investments by cable operators, which we believe is in part related to the ongoing consolidation that is occurring in the broadband industry. While we expect demand to remain at these levels in the first quarter, we look forward to some degree of renewed growth in the broadband market in 2015. As operators expand their spending in support of higher-speed data offerings and as we realize the benefits of our expanded offerings of cable and interconnect products. In summary I just want to say that we are all extremely proud of the company\u2019s excellent growth and record performance in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2014. And despite the many uncertainties that remain in the global economy, our organization continues to execute extremely well and expand our market position. The company\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages leading technology, our broadened and increasing position with customers across the diverse range of end markets in the electronics industry, our presence around the world, a very lean and agile, flexible cost structure as well as an entrepreneurial and dynamic management team that at end of the day makes it happen. Now turning to our outlook for the first quarter and into 2015 I just want to comment that there no doubt continues to a great deal of geopolitical and market uncertainly around the world, including in particular the increased volatility and significant weakening of certain overseas currencies. Accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the first quarter and the full year 2015 the following results. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.286 billion to $1.326 billion and EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% to 10% in local currency as well as an EPS increase of 10% to 14% compared to prior year. For the full year 2015, we anticipate sales in the range of $5.493 billion to $5.653 billion as well as EPS in the range of $2.41 to $2.49. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding one-time items, of 3% to 6% and 7% to 11% respectively over 2014 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 6% to 9%. We are very encouraged by the strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics in the global economy. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of the outstanding Amphenol management team to build upon these newly established record levels of revenue and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability into 2015. And operator, at this stage, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Thank you. And the question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions for me. I guess one I think you guys spent a fair bit of time talking about just some of the FX impact in Q1 and in 2015. Is there a way to think about what is the FX impact on your EPS and potentially even free cash flow for the year? Diana Reardon : Sure. I think if you think about what the potential FX impacts on income are I think you have got two components. One is translation component, which is just the mathematics of converting foreign currency sales into U.S. dollars. And I think we have disclosed what the sales impact of that is. I would tell you that if you wanted to compute that impact, you could probably use an average ROS on those sales. So, it would be about the same percentage on income than it is on sales. Yes, the second potential impact is for a mismatch between selling price and cost structure. And I think that\u2019s one where we have a very active program to manage that risk. And I think we have done a very good job historically of being able to manage that down to a level that has never been material for the business and we don\u2019t expect to see anything different in the current environment with respect to that. So, I think the translation impact is the only one that you would have. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And I guess I get $0.07 to $0.08 impact to EPS based on the return on sales math. I guess, Adam, maybe you could just touch on the M&A environment, your capital allocation in 2015 as you go forward, maybe just touch on your ability or desire to do deals, how big of a deal would you like to do? And this maybe a little na\u00efve, but do you think a declining euro the way it has makes it increase the probability of you guys doing deals in Europe given you have a better currency today than 6 months ago? Adam Norwitt : Yes, Amit, well, thank you very much for the question. I think what I would just say relative to the overall M&A environment, we continue to feel that we have a very strong position as what we term the acquirer of choice in the industry. We are very pleased with the acquisition that we made here in the fourth quarter of Goldstar just an outstanding company, not located in Europe, but certainly an outstanding company where it is in China. And we continue to see in terms of capital allocation that M&A remains the best return for us on our capital together with new product expansion and then we have obviously the buyback as well as the dividend program that Diana has talked about very often. But relative to M&A, we continued to be very aggressive. We continued to have a very robust pipeline of deals. And I think what we are very pleased with is as we have expanded the company and expanded the kind of scope of the interconnect solution that we are approaching, including everything from connectors to cable assemblies to flex assemblies to antennas as well as now sensors, the universe of opportunities for acquisitions if anything has grown over the last half of a decade for us and that opens up many, many opportunities for us to pursue interesting companies. Relative to size there is no question that we have the wherewithal from the capital standpoint and the financial strength to do deals of quite significant size and we would not shy away from that. At the same time we have a very simple, but also pretty strict criteria for acquisitions and that has not changed. It starts with management and us looking to find companies that are run by strong managers who want to really succeed beyond where they have succeeded in the past by being part of Amphenol. We look for companies that have outstanding technology and technology that is really complementary to us. And we look for companies that have a complementary market position in an area where we see growth potential. I think size has never been one of those criterias and it continues not to be a criteria, but no doubt with the financial strength that we have created over these years we have probably more capacity to make a bigger acquisition if that was certainly available. Relative to the declining euro things go up and things go down. And I think you know well having followed the company for many, many years that we are not opportunistic in the sense that when a currency goes down, we immediately change and we hunt for companies in that area to try to get something on the cheap or otherwise, that\u2019s really not the mindset that we approach. We take a very long view to these acquisitions and we have a pipeline of acquisitions that is made up of companies in every geography around the world. And certainly we will continue to pursue them regardless of where the currency rates have moved in a given day. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. Adam a question on the sensor market and as you bring that business into the fold, just curious kind of the opportunity set that you are seeing from a product development and design standpoint with your customers, if you can give us any insight into that? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thank you very much Craig. It\u2019s just really exciting I mean here we are in a roughly 13 months after having acquired the Advanced Sensors business, 13 months and 3 days to be exact and we continue to just have positive surprises, I would say every month, every quarter almost every week in terms of validating our original intention to get into the sensors market. How would I describe that, I mean I said early on that we were very excited by the sensor market in particular because we saw a great combination of the technology of interconnect and sensors that the value of a sensor comes not just from that sensor element but rather from that total package that you are selling to customers and very frequently that is an interconnect package. That was obviously we said that at the day when we bought the company and I can tell you that now 13 months later knowing a lot more than we knew 13 months ago, no question that that has been validated. When we go to customers, there is no doubt about it. There is a positive reception to \u2013 by the customers to the idea that we can bring to those meetings an engineer who gets the sensor, who gets the underlying technology of the sensing element together with an engineer who gets how to connect that into the system, because at the end of the day you can have the best element in the world, but if it doesn\u2019t connect into the system, it doesn\u2019t matter. It just won\u2019t work. And I think that is a challenge that our customers have wrestled with for many, many years. And again that has just been validated time and again as I visited customers and as I have talked to our team and those in and out of our team met customers and otherwise that combination of the interconnect together with the sensor is a very, very compelling proposition for our customers. So I think as it relates to the product development, we have seen lot of activities between our organization pre-acquisition the interconnect engineering teams together with the sensing engineering teams that came with Advanced Sensors and then later Casco. Does that mean that you flip a switch and the sales go up by a precipitous amount in a moment, of course that doesn\u2019t mean that, because there is the lead time to designing those products. You are working in many cases on very long cycle, harsh environment programs in either the automotive or the industrial market, medical, heavy equipment and places like that. So these aren\u2019t just immediate kind of switches that you can flip, but at the end of the day, there is no doubt that there is a positive momentum behind that and that we see great opportunities in the future to leverage the sensors together with the connectors. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Thanks. And as my follow-up for Diana, appreciate the color and context around FX, any commentary on metal prices, particularly copper with the decline if that\u2019s a little bit of help or above and beyond that any kind of puts and takes to below the line-out margins as you think through 2015? Diana Reardon : Yes. Relative I mean to the contributors to margin and commodity prices and oil and this kind of thing, I mean, I think as we have said before, there are many contributors to margin and it\u2019s never easy to single out specific items, but certainly in addition to strong sales growth and good operational execution, a more supportive commodity environment normally is a positive certainly in product areas, where metals or certain plastics or even transportation costs can be particularly important. But the way that we look at this really the ultimate impact on margin depends largely on the balance between input cost and pricing and that balance tends really to be dependent upon the perceptions of demand levels. And I would say that right now given the current extreme market volatility whether you talk about currencies or commodities or oil economic growth, I mean, it really prevents a bit of a challenge in terms of \u2013 for some markets in terms of establishing what that direction and what that demand is. And so we really right now wouldn\u2019t say that we see any particular abnormal advantage or tailwind from a margin perspective on a consolidated basis relative to any of these trends from a commodity standpoint. But I think also as we have said in response to this question in the past, you can be certainly assured that our management team is going to do the best to capture and keep any advantage that does present itself in the marketplace from commodities, oil or anything else that comes along. Operator : Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. You may ask your question. Amitabh Passi : Hi, thank you guys. I had a question and a follow-up. Maybe this is a bit of a finer point and a subtle point, Adam, but I was curious if I look at your first quarter 2015 guidance, it seems like much of the impact is seasonal in some of your markets like mobile devices, concerns around FX. I am just curious are you sensing maybe an increasing level of caution across the Board in terms of order patterns or maybe lead times or are orders being pushed out? I am just wondering if there is a sense of caution in terms of the overall demand environment or do you think again it\u2019s around FX and just maybe seasonality? Adam Norwitt : Yes, thank you very much, Amitabh. I think that as we look into the first quarter, one thing I will say is the whole world there is a sense of uncertainty. I think that has not been a change. I mean, every quarter there seems to be something new about which the TVs can speak and the newspapers can write, but there is no doubt that there is a lot of uncertainty in the world today. I think as we look at our guidance, I think you correctly characterized that there are some seasonal effects. There is obviously the impact of currency, which is a very dramatic volatility. And as Diana mentioned, you can\u2019t even look at that currency in a vacuum. It is reflective of some overall dynamic going on in the worldwide market. I think there are also some specific markets, things, a market like, for example, a mobile infrastructure, whereas I mentioned we don\u2019t expect that market to grow this year after having a fabulous growth in 2014, a little bit because operators are digesting that which they built over the course of the recent quarters here. So, I think it is largely seasonality. At the same time, there is no doubt about it, a general sense of uncertainty. I would not point though that there has been any significant pullbacks of orders. There have not been any cancellations or pullouts or some of those more sort of short-term things that one would look at as the sign of a kind of an immediate impending doom. There is certainly none of that that we have seen. Amitabh Passi : Excellent. And then just as a follow-up, I guess more specifically on the IT datacom segment, you spoke about returning to growth this year. It looks like in 2014 storage might have been a bit better than networking. So, just wanted to understand what drives growth this year? Are all your end markets storage servers, networking performing better? Are you getting greater traction with some of the web scale players? Just any help you can give in terms of the growth drivers? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean, I think I mentioned in my early remarks that this has been a very challenging market, in particular, because of the significant structural changes that have happened in that market. And you have really what you know very well and better than I through your coverage of that space, a true disruption that has happened and a shifting of the balance of power in that and you see that as the OEMs release their results some of which have come out just in the 24 hours or 48 hours. And what we have done in that time and thank goodness we have the agility and the nimble organization to do so. It\u2019s a very rapidly redeploy our resources towards those web centric and cloud computing type companies towards the ODM manufacturers, towards the direct datacenter market. And that\u2019s \u2013 those are efforts that we have really been accelerating over the course of the last year and which we would expect to pay more significant dividends going ahead. As I look at those groups servers, storage and networking, I don\u2019t think that we see a kind of a different shape to those going into this year. There is no doubt that in 2014 networking was the real drag on the performance, I mean that networking business was down significantly compared to a server and storage business that we are actually up on a full year basis. I think going into this year, we wouldn\u2019t expect that to be so much of a differential between those spaces. But again who knows to be honest, because that is the space where there is more change to come, no question you will see new players arrives and old players disappear and you will see further shift in the balance of who is spending what money. But what will not change and that\u2019s very clear is that data will continue to grow exponentially and the desire to process that data and in fact the need to process that data. This is not going to abate. It\u2019s a question of hunting down who is ultimately doing it. And in that case, I bet on a nimble organization like ours more than any other to go in and ferret that out and establish where those new buying patterns are happening. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may ask your question. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon and happy New Year. Adam Norwitt : Happy New Year. Matt Sheerin : Thanks. A question to Adam regarding the GE sensor business, you talked about the cross-selling opportunities and obviously the opportunities within sensors, from an operating perspective, I know the margins there were below Amphenol\u2019s margins, what kind of progress have you made and how much is left? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think we would say that we have made very good progress there. If you look I mean that\u2019s not the only factor. We have had a lot of great execution in driving our margins up quarter-to-quarter over the course of this year. But very clearly we did talk about it in the first quarter last year that the kind of dilutive effect of the lower than average margins of the Advanced Sensors business did pull down our margins in the first quarter. I think the fact that we have brought those margins back up and now in the last quarter 50 basis points higher than before we acquired the Advanced Sensors business is a reflection of the great execution of our total team as well as some impact from improvement in Advanced Sensors. No one has ever done in Amphenol though. So there will be much room to go. Matt Sheerin : Got it. And regarding your commentary on oil and gas market being softer, which obviously makes sense, how big a business is that for you relative to your industrial exposure and are you just seeing backlog or bookings start to fall going into the year? Adam Norwitt : Look I mean the beauty of our industrial business and very much like total Amphenol is we have a very, very broad industrial business and there is not any segment across our industrial business which dominates that space. And while it\u2019s true that oil and gas has been one of the helpful drivers and that it won\u2019t be a help going into this year, it is still a market that we continued to believe will have strong performance as I mentioned in my early remarks. So look, there is no question when the price of oil drops by more than half people are going to drill less, they are going hunt less and they are going to explore less and they are going to ultimately use less equipment and those equipment makers are going to use less connectors in making that smaller amount of equipment, so that is what it is. Our team will react very well. We have a very broad presence again in many areas of the energy market and that\u2019s not even just confined to oil and gas, it includes alternative energy. But you can rest assured that those individuals in the company who are in that space who have seen no doubt about it some pullbacks in order volumes, they are taking the appropriate Amphenol like reactions in terms of measuring their resources and adjusting their resources accordingly. While we reallocate resources to the high growth opportunities that still remain across the industrial market. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Mark Delaney : Good afternoon and thanks very much for letting me ask a question. I was hoping if you could talk first on the M&A situation and have you see any change in the valuations and the level of competitive activity for any of your competitors are trying to bid for some of the same customers that you are and is that impacting the valuations that you are able to get? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I commented earlier that we still feel very positive about the M&A environment and there is no doubt about that. I mean, look multiples go up and multiples go down. We tend not to sort of chase market multiples. We tend to develop long-term relationships with companies. And then ultimately if we develop mutually a trust between us, we are usually able to find a fair price that satisfies both sides. And I think that\u2019s been our approach in acquisitions. We are not a kind of tactical deal-based acquisition company. We are very much a long-term view towards acquisitions. There are certainly lots of companies in our space and in other spaces related to our space. We want to make lots of acquisitions. And they are going to buy some companies and we are not going to buy some companies, but that\u2019s no change. I mean, that has been the case for a decade and a half across this industry. But over the course of that time period, we have managed to buy somewhere around 70 companies and we have acquired 12 companies just in the last 3 years as the equity markets have expanded and multiples have expanded. And we have continued to still be able to find good companies for fair prices. I don\u2019t say it\u2019s cheap. We are not trying to get cheap prices, but we are getting fair prices and excellent companies. And I think we will continue to find good opportunities to continue on that path. Mark Delaney : Understood. And then you also mentioned the expansion of the buyback program in your prepared remarks, if you could just help us understand how you plan on implementing the buyback? Diana Reardon : Sure. I mean, we implement the buyback program as we always have done in the past really each quarter we take a look at a very balanced look at what our acquisition program looks like and we then make the decision on that basis as to how much additional capital it makes sense to deploy. If you go back and look at last year, if you look at the last 5 years, you know what, the results of that has been that about half of the free cash flow of the company has gone back to shareholders in the form either of dividends or stock buybacks. And so if one wanted some sort of proxy, one could use that historical pattern, I would just say that, that we will and we do I think as Adam said before, we prioritized the acquisition program in terms of use of the company\u2019s financial strength, because we really believe that, that provides the best long-term return for the company and for the shareholders, but other than that, if you wanted to use an historical pattern for a proxy of what the company would do with a stock buyback program, I would think that will be fine. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. You may ask your question. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions for me. Adam, first off on the auto market outlook you discussed for 2015 you mentioned strong double-digit growth. I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant from an organic standpoint versus say how fast you are going to grow over global vehicle production? And then you did mention a bunch of market extensions there, I don\u2019t know if you could highlight one or two that are driving that? And then just real quick on tablets declining this year, is that a function of unit demand for tablets, market share shifts that your customers or with your products or just any design changes that is impacting you? A little color there would help? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thanks very much, Steve. I think with your first part on the auto market, we do have still a very positive outlook for that market and we have just made outstanding progress. Our whole organization who works in that space, I just can\u2019t applaud them enough for what they have achieved here over the course of the last 5 years in terms of expanding our product offering and getting really positioned on high technology complex interconnect systems that are enabling next-generation electronics in cars. And so as we look going into next year and I mentioned we have strong double-digit outlook, we have also a very strong outlook organically in that space. And I don\u2019t know what the latest numbers are for car expectations, I know you wrote that in the report, but I am sorry, but I forget exactly the number you said, but I know maybe that\u2019s a low single-digit or so outlook for car volumes and we would certainly expect our business to perform significantly above those levels on an organic basis as a result of these excellent design-ins we have on really long-term next-generation systems. Relative to the mobile devices market, I did mention that we expect growth in smartphones and related accessories together with our laptops being offset by some reduction in tablets. I think that reduction in tablets is a combination what is predominantly driven by just unit volume expectations in the tablet space, where I think there has been \u2013 that\u2019s been widely reported of some of the unit volumes that go. We talked I think a number of quarters ago about some content reductions in the tablet space. And while there maybe some impact from that I think the broader impact comes really from the reduction in units of tablets. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Shawn Harrison with Longbow Research. You may ask your question. Shawn Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions\u2026 Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Happy New Year, Shawn. Shawn Harrison : Thanks Adam. Two questions, but the first on mobile networks is there anyway with the weakness you are anticipating for 2015 if you can maybe give some geographic insights and maybe if you are seeing are region up versus other regions down. And then the second Diana I just wanted to confirm I think last time on the call you said you are targeting CapEx for this year around 3% to 3.5% of sales, just wondering if that number holds true? Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much Shawn. I think it\u2019s a little too early to say what region is going to perform at what level in the mobile networks market going forward. I think what we are very pleased with here in 2014 is that all the regions Asia, North America and Europe all grew in double digits. I think that growth was strongest in Asia, there is no question. But we had also very, very strong growth in Europe and excellent growth in North America as well. So looking at this year on the basis of our expectations that some of these operators are going to be taking a little time to digest their investments, I don\u2019t know that that would be so much differential across the regions, but it\u2019s early to say in that market. Diana Reardon : And from a CapEx standpoint that still would hold true Shawn. It would be about 3%, 3.5% of sales that would be down from 2014 levels where we were funding some new buildings and so forth that won\u2019t repeat in 2015. Shawn Harrison : Thanks a lot. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. You may ask your question. Jim Suva : Thank you and Adam and Diana congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol for great results and outlook. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Jim. Jim Suva : I have one question for Adam and one question for Diana and they are pretty unrelated, but Adam when we talked about the integration of your acquisitions such as the GE sensor market and things like that and great progress there. But I have to wonder about on the cross-selling opportunity, is that still more to come in the future and the reason why I ask it a lot of designs for connectors and interconnect with sensors are designed in from a product inception and necessarily don\u2019t rule out immediately to say hey stop using this competitor\u2019s connector and start using Amphenol\u2019s connectors. So I guess the question Adam is that still more in the future to come and if so does that typically take and I guess this is your first real sensor company acquisition, do you envision that kind of more like a 2 to 3 year down the road of being able to designing more Amphenol content or when do you expect that to happen, is there still more upside. And one for Diana on the question a little follow-up on the raw materials, if I remember correctly I think the at the coaxial business has a significantly more percent wise of say copper and plastic/petroleum-based products and if so can you walk us through about the timing of when raw materials could potentially help your company such as I believe you would have to buy the materials, procure it and put it together then sell it, so maybe there is a little bit of a lagging impact to raw materials going lower to your margins, so maybe a couple of quarters down the road. And do you typically give back like half and keep half the savings in general or how should we think about that? Thank you. Diana Reardon : Jim maybe I will go first. I don\u2019t know that I would give a very different answer on the cable business than I gave on the interconnect business. I think that the going way, way back in the cable business when we had no sort of ancillary products and we had a lot of hard-line cable there was one commodity in particular that was certainly a dominant piece of the puzzle there. I would say now the business is a little more diverse from a product standpoint to start with and I think you have that same relationship that I talked about between pricing and cost structure. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that in that business we necessarily see a significant tailwind at this point. I would reiterate though that if we certainly get the opportunity for significant savings that \u2013 and get the opportunity from a demand standpoint to keep those we certainly are quite good at doing that. We have a very good profitability track record and then we will certainly make every effort to get the most bang for the buck there. But we really just don\u2019t see in either segment at this point a significant benefit coming through purely because of commodity prices. Adam Norwitt : Yes. And Jim relative to your first question on the integration and the various opportunities for cross-selling, I mean, I would just say once again that we have \u2013 there is tremendous activity across the company of getting engineers together with engineers, getting salespeople together with salespeople and working with customers. But you correctly point out that there is a time cycle. There is a cycle to program development. It is not always that you have to be there on the first day of conception of something, because in fact, it\u2019s not always at that time when the connectors or the sensors are designed in. And I think there is one additional thing. As you look in industrial and in particular in automotive, there is an advent now of more what I would call mid-cycle upgrades and that comes from a very simple dynamic. It is the fact that all of us are used now to upgrading our personal technology on a very frequent basis. I mean, we are getting a new phone every 6 months. My kids would prefer to have one every 3 months I think, but they are getting it every year or two and very unhappy because of it, but we have a human need to upgrade technology, because there is such a rapid pace of improvement of the functionality of that technology. The automakers, the industrial equipment makers, they have not been blind to this dynamic. And thus you are starting to see more and more potential for what I would call non-mission critical mid-cycle upgrades. We saw that very clearly in things like the lighting. We made a wonderful acquisition several years ago of a company in automotive lighting. And immediately, what we saw was changing the lights much more frequently than they are changing the body types. It\u2019s called the cosmetic upgrade. They are doing the same things with some of these electronic systems. So, putting in a new temperature sensing system of some sort, putting in some sort of new telematic system, whenever that is, there are these mid-cycle upgrades which have the potential to shorten the lifecycle that is there. I can tell you I was just a couple of weeks ago in Las Vegas at this Consumer Electronics Show, which I in many ways wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy because you wear through at least a pair of shoes and you bump into a lot of people over the course of a few hours. But what was amazing is just to see the proliferation in the automotive industry of the electronics. I mean, that show is becoming an automotive show, where it used to be a computer show years ago. And I think that\u2019s another reflection of this expansion of electronics that you see of things that are moving faster than just new body types and new engine types and new transmissions that used to be the kind of gating feature on these long lifecycles. So, I think it\u2019s true that the cross-selling will take time. It always takes time regardless, because we are not in the business of kind of throwing these new companies into chaos. We let them run their company, the day they come into Amphenol. We don\u2019t want things to change. And from that respect, we want the same people to be running that business and performing, but then we slowly opened doors of opportunity to them both collaborating with their peers and opening doors into customers where they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had a presence and therein lies the long-term value that we can create with these acquisitions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. You may ask your question. William Stein : Thanks. I\u2019d like to dig into the very good operating margin performance for a second. You have long had 20% aggregate operating margin sort of bogey, I think this is the second time you have exceeded it and you have had 25% fall through target and you had very good fall through in the quarter. I am wondering if either owing to your growing revenue in sensors and more integrated products, Adam, that you discussed you talked about flex circuits and other sort of more integrated products, I am wondering if that\u2019s potentially resulting in the ability to deliver higher still either fall through or aggregate operating margins? Adam Norwitt : No, I mean, maybe I will make some comment briefly and then let Diana also address this. I think that is not really the main driver. I mean, we believe that there is good product \u2013 there is good profit opportunities across all of the spaces that we participate in. And I think those areas that you point out really open up great opportunities for profitable growth for the company and expansion. Diana Reardon : Sure. I mean, I think that we have done a great job in 2014 in terms of expansion and you referred to that. I think we have also guided in 2015 on a year-over-year basis to strong margin expansion. And I think that the keys to that really are the same as they have always been. It\u2019s a focus on technology and it\u2019s a culture of accountability, attention to detail from a cost standpoint and the company\u2019s entrepreneurial structure. I think as Adam said that applies across the board to everything that we do that doesn\u2019t apply more or less to one technology or the other. I think that if you look at the 2015 guidance and you look at the earnings per share growth know that we have guided. If you just take the high end as an example, we have got a 6% sales growth from the high end and we have got in 11% earnings per share growth. And so if you look at the diversified group of EPS growth drivers that are really contributing to that performance I think this is extremely strong guidance for the year. And you have got organic sales growth in multiple markets that drives that. You have got margin expansion that I talked about with our margins going from about 19.6% to 20% next year. We have got the contribution from our acquisitions program that Adam talked about at length. We have got the contribution from the stock buyback program and we have got a lower effective interest rate from the refinancing actions that we took in 2014. So I think that when we look at the guidance we have given in 2015, we don\u2019t see any need to set any other goals and I think these are great goals. This is a very strong performance both from an operating margin perspective and from a total EPS growth standpoint. And I think as a team we certainly will feel very, very good about the achievements of those goals as we lay them out for 2015. William Stein : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thanks a lot. Adam could you comment a little bit about the diversification within mobile devices given the flat guidance for the year particularly if you are participating with some of the newer players that seem to be gaining share rapidly in the emerging smartphone market? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure. I think I discussed earlier about the product diversification. And I think I will just remind you that we have a strong position really across the board with customers and in every space in the mobile devices markets. I think that the \u2013 our position is not totally different from the various market share positions of the various customers that are out there and has always been the case. And I think what we have been very successful over the years is regardless of who the winners are and who the losers are we have managed over very long-term to build our business successfully. And we remain committed to continuing that trend going forward. There is no question that there have been some very nice new companies who have come about and we have participated with many if not all of those companies in a variety of fashions both with our interconnect as well as our antenna products. And we will continue to do so. And I think as you look into this coming year, it remains a market that is very hard market to predict. It remains the market where the winners of yesterday are not the winners of today. And the winners of today may not be the winners of tomorrow. But regardless we will remain committed to staying present with all of those. The whole underlying success that we have had is really based on a cultural difference of our organization who works in mobile devices, who play \u2013 who effectively works across these many different customers in these many different products in a way that reflects just a tremendous agility ducking and dodging as things come your way. I mean it is not an easy market for them, but they do a fabulous, fabulous job by remaining quick, by getting quickly on to the right programs and effectively all the programs. But ultimately the outlook that we have given is one that is reflective of the fact that it is a difficult market to predict and one where if as I said there are further opportunities for growth, I am sure our organization will be the first to really pounce upon those and execute well. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks Adam. And a quick one for Diana if I could just a follow-up on your comments from the previous question, your 2015 guidance the midpoint incremental margins are well north of 30%. And when you look at the realized sort of incremental margins across the last several quarters they have very strong north of 20% and 22.5% range for most of the time and if you look over the last several years that\u2019s being true too, so what do you think is really changing within sort of that is driving the incremental almost 10 points more of incremental margin within the guidance range? Diana Reardon : We don\u2019t see 10 points more of incremental margin when we look at the guidance we see conversion margins as we call them that are a little above 25, but certainly not 30. So, I guess I don\u2019t have exactly the same math that you have. It is true that we had some quarters in 2014 to your point that we are in excess of 30. And I think that when we talk through those quarters and those really were Q2 and Q3. We had a certainly strong operating execution with some contribution from some of the acquisitions coming up to speed. And I think as I said before, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint so precisely every single element that contributes to enhanced operating income margins. But I think that we feel certainly very comfortable with the guidance that we have given, it does include as I said before an expansion in ROS for the year and does have conversion margins that are I would say slightly higher than our 25% goal, but not materially different. And we continue to go along and think that, that is the appropriate goal for the company. We always try to do more, try to do better if we can, but I think we will feel quite good at the end of the day when we achieve these 2015 goals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question. Brian White : Great. Just on the March quarter outlook at the midpoint, it looks like sales fall 8% sequentially, I know historically the last I think 5 years it\u2019s been flat on average. So, what is really driving the seasonality that seems a little more magnified in this March quarter? Diana Reardon : Yes. The 5 years, I am not sure what acquisition impacts you have in there. I think if you look from an organic standpoint, the first quarter tends to be down unless you have a particular market that is doing something unusual. I mean, if you would look at last year\u2019s first quarter as an example, we did still have a sequential decline, but in that particular quarter as an example, the mobile network market had a big sequential upswing. So, you do have some markets that from time-to-time behave unusually in the first quarter, but I think as far as we are concerned, our normal range is down 4%, 5% kind of range. Maybe this is a percent more. At the high end of guidance, it\u2019s a couple of percent more. At the low end of guidance, I guess, it depends upon which you want to look at, but I don\u2019t think we feel that this is an unusual first quarter from a seasonality perspective. Brian White : Okay. Because the only first quarter I see that\u2019s weaker was first quarter of \u201809, which was down 13%. In the history, I never see a quarter go down more than that. Diana Reardon : Yes. I mean, sometimes we have acquisitions, Brian, that come in, in the first quarter that muck up the comparisons. I mean, you kind of need to look at the organic numbers. And I would just off the top of my head, I don\u2019t know all the stats in front of me, but our sales tend to be down a few percent in the first quarter on an organic basis. Brian White : Okay. And then Adam, when we think about this sensor market, do you feel like you have all the tools in that market that you would like, you can service all the verticals that you would like or what percent of the way through are you? It sounds like at a big opportunity it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s new? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I know it is a big opportunity, it\u2019s exciting and it\u2019s new, though it is all very true, but do we have all the kind of tools? I mean, I would say, do we have all of the products to offer all the attractive markets? And the answer is absolutely not. I think when we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors business, we are very excited by one thing in particular which was it was a very diversified company, but it was very diversified, but it was certainly not everything. And so it was a great place to start the Advanced Sensors, because it gave us the presence across the automotive and industrial market. Within the industrial market, it gave us the presence in a variety of areas, heavy equipment, medical, HVAC, in smart buildings and things like that. It gave us also an access into pressure and temperature, gas and moisture. And then the addition of Casco added to our automotive sensor offering with rain sensing and light as well as additional temperature sensing, but no question. I mean, we are far, far from having what I would call a comprehensive sensor portfolio. And that\u2019s the great opportunity. Because the opportunity comes both in our organic developments of new products which our teams are certainly doing and are being driven and supported to do much more than they were under the umbrella of a big industrial conglomerate. And at the same time, we have a robust pipeline of sensor acquisitions, which over the coming years and half decades and decades ahead, we will pursue with the same level of aggression and effectiveness that we have done in the interconnect market. And we don\u2019t today have every connector either. It\u2019s a big beautiful diversified market where we still see great opportunities for expansion. And I think that\u2019s doubly true with the sensors. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group. You may ask your question. Ryan Hunter : This is actually Ryan Hunter on for Mike. And I just have a few quick questions. First in regards to the Goldstar acquisition, is this more opportunistic due to declines in China heavy equipment market over the past few years or a technology acquisition and the synergies between \u2013 with your auto and current industrial business? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think this was not opportunistic, I mean we have known the company for a very long time. We have a great sense of understanding and also optimism relative to the China industrial market and its totality. And I think we see great opportunities for continued expansion with that company. It\u2019s a fabulous, fabulous company I mean really you walk into their factory you don\u2019t feel like you are out in the middle of nowhere China which is kind of where their operations are. You feel like you are in really a world class manufacturing operation and thus the customers who want to have that same world class support they really flock to Goldstar. And I think the great \u2013 there is a great opportunity domestically in China, but there is an equal and attractive opportunity servicing customers around the world with their low cost base and so those are \u2013 it\u2019s a are very, very exciting company and certainly far from opportunistic in our case. Ryan Hunter : Cool and we have seen obviously a recent drop in input costs like gold and copper and can you guys discuss what tailwinds that you have embedded in your fiscal year \u201915 guidance from price costs and what end market would be the biggest beneficiaries? Adam Norwitt : I think Diana already mentioned a lot about the fact that we see that what\u2019s important is not necessarily the input costs but the balance of input costs in the end market environment. And I think as she mentioned very well, we will no doubt seize on whatever opportunity comes from those input costs, but it is not just an automatic, there is not just an automatic flow through and if the market environment \u2013 if those input costs are reflective of an overall market environment which is not as robust then you don\u2019t tend to be able to just put everything into one\u2019s pocket. Adam Norwitt : Very good. Well, I think this was the last question and we truly appreciate all of your attention and support and look forward to seeing you or hearing from you at least in three months from now. Happy New Year again and we will talk to you soon. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. And have a nice day.",

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Ms. Diana Reardon. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon, and I\u2019m Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Q1 results were released this morning. I\u2019ll provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We\u2019ll then have a question-and-answer session. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.327 billion and $0.057 of earnings, meeting the high-end of the Company\u2019s guidance. Sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to Q1 of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in Q1 2015 were up 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically from Q4 of 2014. Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales in the quarter was down 3% from last year. Our interconnect business, which comprises 94% of our sales, was up 17% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Turning to operating income, operating income increased to $260 million in the quarter. Operating margin increased to 19.6% compared to 18.8% last year excluding one-time items, a strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 32%. The increase of 80 basis points in operating margins over the prior year resulted from an increase in profitability in our interconnect business. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 12.1% compared to 12.2% last quarter. In the interconnect business, margins were 21.8%, up 90 basis points from 20.9% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution both organically and in our acquisitions in addition to aggressive cost management. We\u2019re very pleased with the Company\u2019s operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic global environment. To the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remained fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $19 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the Company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is the result of a new note issuance in September replacing a higher cost net maturity in November of last year and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income was $4.1 million in the quarter, equal to last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate, excluding the impact of one-time items with 26.5% in both Q1 of 2015 and Q1 of 2014. Including the impact of one-time items, the 2014 rate was 26.4%. Net income in the quarter was approximately 14% of sales and EPS excluding one-time items increased 14%, an excellent performance. On as reported basis earnings per share in the 2014 period included a charge of $2 million or $0.01 for acquisition related cost. Orders in the quarter were $1.34 billion, up 2% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.01 to 1. The company continues to be a strong generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $188 million in the quarter, or about 104% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $871 million at the end of the March, up slightly from September. Inventory days were 87 days, up seven days from December levels and at the high end of our normal range. The higher inventory level supports a future step up in certain parts of the business and we expect inventory days to decline going forward. Accounts receivable was $1.1 billion at the end of March, down about 3% from December. Days sales outstanding were 75 days, up four days from December and at the high end of our normal range. Accounts payable was $583 million at the end of March, down about 6% from December levels, and payable days were 58 days, up one day compared to December. The cash flow from operations along with proceeds from our commercial paper program of $86 million and $20 million of proceeds from stock option exercises were used primarily to purchase $62 million of the Company\u2019s common stock to fund net capital expenditures of $40 million, to fund acquisition payments of $76 million relating both to the Invotec acquisition and the final payment on a 2014 acquisition and to fund $78 million in dividend payments during the quarter including the funding of both the Q1 and Q2 dividends. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares under its January 2015 10-million-share stock repurchase program and 8.9 million shares remain available at the end of March under the program which expires in January of 2017. Cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion at the end of March, majority of which is held outside the U.S. Our total debt was $2.8 billion, bringing net debt at the end of the quarter to $1.4 billion. The company had issued $753 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program at the end of the quarter and EBITDA for Q1 2015 was approximately $300 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I\u2019d like to make a few comments relative to our guidance. As noted in the press release, we\u2019ve updated our 2015 guidance range to sales of $5.50 million to $5.62 billion and earnings of $2.41 to $2.47. This is a sales growth of 3% to 5% both in U.S. dollars and organically and 7% to 9% from a local currency standpoint. EPS growth is 7% to 10%. This guidance is based on current exchange rates reflecting the negative impact of the significantly stronger dollar and the addition of the acquisition of Invotec which we closed in the quarter. The negative translation impact caused by the significant strengthening of the dollar in relation in the euro and certain other currencies since our last guidance has been impact of reducing 2015 guidance by about $65 million in sales and about $0.03 in earnings. For the full year 2015 compared to 2014, we now expect a drag of about $225 million or 4% of sales from the negative effects of translation and an impact of about $0.10 in earnings. The Invotec acquisition that closed in the quarter adds about $30 million in sales and $0.01 in earnings. From an organic growth perspective, we\u2019d increased our growth range from 2% to 5% in our previous guidance to 3% to 5% in our current guidance. And Adam will talk about trends by market in more detail in a moment. I would just add here that we have reflected some shift in demand in the wireless markets in our guidance. Those wireless markets were previously expected to be relatively flat in 2015. However, we now expect a decline in the mobile network market in the low-teens and a high single-digit growth in sales in the mobile device market with the majority of that growth expected in the second half of 2015. I will also just note relative to the Q2 guidance that from a sequential standpoint at the high end of guidance, sales were up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically with the negative translation impact from the stronger dollar reducing sales by about 1%. From an organic standpoint, the 3% sequential growth in Q2 sales is somewhat lower than our normal seasonality. This results from our current expectations that the wireless market will be relatively flat sequentially. Historically, both markets normally increased sequentially going into Q2. However, as I mentioned earlier, we now see a softer demand in the mobile network market for the year and therefore do not expect the normal seasonal uptick in Q2. And in the mobile devices market, we now see a flat sequential performance in Q2 based primarily on program timing before a significant strengthening in the second half of 2015. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Diana. And let me also add my welcome to those of you on the call today. As Diana mentioned I\u2019m going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements and then I\u2019ll spend some time to discuss their trends and progress across our diverse served markets. Then finally, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on our outlook for the second quarter, as well as for the full year. With respect to the first quarter, I\u2019m just very pleased to report that our sales and EPS were both at the high end of guidance and that\u2019s despite a challenging economic environment, as well as the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Our sales increased 7% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching that $1.327 billion. And orders at $1.340 billion were a book-to-bill of 1.01 to 1 which is an encouraging sign. Our profitability in the quarter continues to be very strong as we generated operating margins of 19.6% which as Diana mentioned is an 80-basis-point increase from prior year. And our EPS grew 14% from prior year essentially despite the rate of our sales growth. I just want to say that I\u2019m extremely proud of our global team who was once again able to react quickly to the many opportunities that are being created by the electronics revolution, all the while exercising the discipline and drive necessary to achieve outstanding operating performance. And I think our strong results in this first quarter once again demonstrate the benefits of the company\u2019s outstanding entrepreneurial culture. I\u2019m very pleased in the quarter that we completed the acquisition of Invotec during the first quarter. And Invotec is the leading UK based manufacturer of highly engineered, harsh environment, printed circuit boards, flex circuits and related assemblies for the aerospace, defense and industrial markets, that has annual sales of roughly $35 million. Importantly, Invotec represents an outstanding complement to our North American PCB and flex circuit capabilities and positions us to take further advantage of the ongoing drive to proliferate this technology in important aerospace and industrial applications and that is a trend that we\u2019re really seeing across our global customer base in that space. We\u2019re very excited to welcome the outstanding Invotec to Amphenol and we look forward to continuing to create value in the future with our very successful acquisition program. Turning to our trends and progress across our served markets, I just want to comment first that once again our balanced and broad end market diversification supported the Company\u2019s excellent performance in the first quarter. And we\u2019re particularly pleased that no single market represented more than 18% of total sales in the quarter. The fact that the company\u2019s diversification across electronics industry and areas with the wide variety of technology requirements, product lifecycles and underlying drivers has consistently been an underlying creator of long-term value for the company. Turning to those markets, first the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat the prior year in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currency, led by increases in communications, vehicle and rotorcraft related products. Sequentially, as we had expected, sales were down into mid-single-digits. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these levels and we remain confident in achieving full year growth in constant currency in the military market. That\u2019s true that military budgets overall appear to have stabilized, but at the same time, they\u2019re clearly not expanding. Nevertheless, our technology leadership and our broad program participation have enabled us to realize the growth we experienced in the first quarter and have positioned the company to benefit long term from the expanding adoption of electronics in military hardware, as well as from stronger spending trends in emerging geographies. So commercial aviation market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly in local currency and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars on what was positive growth rates of the components used in the production by the leading aircraft manufacturers. Sequentially, sales reduced seasonally by 7% on lower production volumes. Despite this moderating rate of growth, we remain confident that our commercial air sales will grow in the second quarter from these first quarter levels, and for the full year, we continue to expect to achieve robust organic growth, in particular with the anticipated second half ramp-up of certain new airplane platforms. The world\u2019s airlines continue to demand planes that are more fuel-efficient and that created passenger flying experience, leaving aircraft manufacturers to incorporate an increasing range of complex, new technologies into their latest generation airliners. We extremely are well positioned to enable these technologies with our Interconnect, value-add cable, and printed circuit assemblies and cable management products. This combination creates an exciting, long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol. The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter which is strong growth of 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, compared to prior year and 3% in local currency sequentially. This increase in our sales was driven by excellent performance in the heavy equipment, alternative energy and medical segments, as well as by contributions from the Goldstar acquisition that we completed in the fourth quarter. And that growth was partially offset by an expected decline in sales to oil and gas customers, that\u2019s related to lower levels of exploration and drilling due to the recently reduced commodity prices. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase from these levels in the second quarter, and we continue to anticipate a double-digit sales growth in local currencies for the full year 2015. Long term, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our broad, industrial, interconnect and sensor product offerings, together with our diversified presence across the many exciting segments of the global industrial market. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and we experienced again a significant increase in sales from prior year, growing 31% and 14%, organically as we continue to benefit from the Casco acquisition made last year in the third quarter. And as we grew our sales of new products used in telematics emissions management, and drive train control applications. Sales were essentially flat sequentially in U.S. dollars but they grew by 4% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter. We\u2019re very pleased to be continuing to outgrow the overall automotive electronics market, as we capitalize on our broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new and complex vehicle electronics. With the additions of techbox, Advance Sensors in Casco, during the last 18 months, we have significantly expanded our product offering across a wide array of new electronics applications in cars. In addition, we have organically expanded into a variety of new discreet connectors and advanced value-add interconnect systems, thereby positioning the Company for continued excellent long-term growth. Looking towards the second quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to increase further from these levels and we continue to look forward to an excellent 2015 and beyond for this exciting business. The mobile devices market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 5% from prior year and declined as we had expected by roughly 28% sequentially, driven by post-holiday seasonality. I can just say I\u2019m so proud of our mobile devices team who had once again quickly flex their resources given these significant volume changes, all while still preserving strong operating performance, as well as very importantly, preserving the ability to expand our capacity for growth expected in the second half of 2015. This organizational agility remains a core advantage of Amphenol in the extremely dynamic mobile devices market. As Diana mentioned, while we expect sales to remain at current levels in the second quarter, we now have a more positive view of the demand potential in the mobile devices market in the second half of this year. Thus, we now anticipate achieving growth for the full year of 2015 somewhere in the mid-single digits. And we remain confident that despite the ever-changing landscape across the mobile devices market, our leading technology preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device markers, and most importantly, the excellent execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us extremely well for the future. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and sales declined as we had expected by about 9% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 4% in the local currencies and by 5% sequentially as operators further moderated their network build-out activities in most geographies after last year\u2019s significant infrastructure investments. As Diana mentioned earlier, based on the latest information that we received from our OEM and service provider customers, we now expect only a slight increase from these demand levels in the second quarter if not flat performance and due anticipate a decline in our mobile network sales for the full year of 2015. Regardless of these more muted sales expectations, we remain extremely well-positioned in the mobile networks market and are thus very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products, we will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next-generation mobile network deployments around the world. The information technology and datacom market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market increased by a greater than expected 6% from prior year due to strengthening sales of our wide range of high-speed products incorporated into a broad range of data center equipment. Sequentially, our sales were flat due to a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. And looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to grow slightly from these levels and we continue to anticipate full-year growth in the IT datacom market in the mid-single-digits. This IT market is really undergoing a rapid transformation as cloud and web service providers are driving new innovations across the entire architecture of data centers really around the world. Amidst this dynamic environment, we remain encouraged by our industry-leading high-speed and power products, our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers and our enhanced and direct focus on service provider and data center customers, all of which have created a platform for us to continue to outperform in the future in this important market. The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected, sales declined slightly from prior year on the moderation of spending from U.S. cable operators and were essentially flat to the fourth quarter. While we do expect a slight increase in demand in the second quarter, we now expect more moderate growth in the broadband markets for the full year 2015. As there really remains the heightened level of uncertainty in the capital spending plans of many of the MSO, satellite and telecommunication customers in the space and that\u2019s in particular given the several high profile industry mergers which are still at this stage pending after a long time. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers in support of the rapid growth of especially high speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leadership position in the broadband market. So in summary, with respect for the first quarter, I\u2019m just extremely proud of the Amphenol organization as we once again executed very well in a challenging and dynamic environment. Our continued strong performance in 2015 is another clear reflection of the Company\u2019s distinct competitive advantages, our broad range of leading technologies, our balanced and comprehensive market diversification, our worldwide presence and our lean and flexible cost structure. But above all of these strengths, simply our greatest asset remains a high performance culture that is reinforced everyday by Amphenol\u2019s agile, entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to outlook and just to reiterate some of the comments Diana made, there continues to still be significant uncertainties across the global marketplace that\u2019s reflected in part by the ongoing weakening of certain overseas currencies. Accordingly and based on a continuation of these current economic conditions and assuming also that exchange rates remain stable at these latest levels, we now expect in the second quarter and the full year 2015 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.355 billion and EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.58, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of flat to 3% in U.S. dollars, and 5% to 8% in local currency and an EPS increase of 4% to 7%. For the full year of 2015, we expect sales in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.62 billion, which is an increase of 3% to 5% in U.S. dollars and 7% to 9% in local currencies. And we expect 2015 EPS of $2.41 to $2.47 which represents an increase of 7% to 10% over 2014, excluding one-time items. We are very encouraged by the Company\u2019s continued strong outlook in sales and earnings especially given the many uncertainties in the global marketplace, and it is really the ongoing revolution in electronics that continue to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol. And I\u2019m very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities to grow our market position and to expand our profitability, and thereby, to drive continued superior performance for the Company in 2015 and beyond. With that, operator, we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. Participants we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations to your team at Amphenol. Really great result, especially considering the currency and the changes. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Jim Suva : Diana and Adam, can you help us understand a little bit more granularity on your comments around the mobility? You mentioned some softness. Is this broad based global, is it geographic, is it more like smartphone handset, or tablet, or notebook, or how should we think about that commentary? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Jim, thank you very much. I think we talked about mobility and mobile from two standpoints. One is the mobile networks markets where we do have a more moderate view of that market, as well as the mobile devices market where, I think, we have somewhat stronger view than we previously had. So, I assume what you\u2019re asking is relative to our comments on mobile networks. And in mobile networks, I think, what we have seen is last year, there was just tremendous performance in that market. You know that we grew last year by 24% over prior year, which is really far in excess of many of the statistics that one saw coming out of equipment manufacturers or the various capital spending results of the operators around the world, and I think that was just a great confirmation of the efforts that we\u2019ve made over many years to broaden our product offering in support of these new technologies in these next generation systems. But no doubt about it, that was a lot of build out that happened last year and I think what we\u2019re seeing on a global basis really is that the operators are really working to digest those investments, in particular here in the first half, but even throughout the year, more maybe than we would have thought previously. From a regional standpoint, last year we saw good growth in all of the regions, probably saw a little bit better in Asia but we had strong double-digit growth in every region. I think in this quarter, we probably saw a bit more magnified reductions in Europe, and some reductions in North America. We actually still saw some element of continued strength on a year-over-year basis in Asia. I think for the full year, we would probably anticipate that all the regions would still be in that kind of digestion phase of their investments. But perhaps, maybe Europe would be a little bit weaker than Asia, for example. Relative to mobile devices, again, we are seeing more strength in that space and that just comes down to our organization\u2019s fantastic ability to continue to win programs at the leading device manufacturers. I think we did talked about last year, that we saw a little bit, worst performance last year in tablets, a little bit better performance maybe in things like ultrabooks and we\u2019ve seen good performance with some of the new smartphone manufacturers, as well as some of the accessories around those products. And I think that those trends are largely continuing coming into 2015 and we probably wouldn\u2019t expect a much different performance across that market this year. Jim Suva : Great. And as a very quick follow-up, your acquisition. A lot of times when we hear printed circuit board companies, we think they\u2019re a very low margin business. Am I correct by assuming that this company is a lot more than just printed circuit boards and lot higher value add, and maybe give us a little bit of a flavor or color into, if that\u2019s a [ph] correct statement, more than just printed circuit boards. Adam Norwitt : Now, this is an outstanding question, Jim. And it\u2019s very true that there is a whole industry of printed circuit boards and that\u2019s not an industry that we have in large part participated in. But we do have a business in very high reliability, harsh environment, printed circuits, be it flex or rigid flex or rigid boards, and the related assemblies that is really active in the military area space and industrial space. And that\u2019s what this company is. And so it\u2019s by no means a big entry into printed circuits, rather it\u2019s a continuation of our approach to present a total interconnect solutions for those very high-reliability application that we see in particular in aerospace, military and industrial. One trend that we have seen and we have been really one of the drivers of that trend from a very high technology standpoint is there are applications, in particular in those harsh environments, where traditionally those have been managed through big cable bundles. And that those cable bundles are over timed in certain of those applications being migrated towards a more of a printed circuit technology that integrates connectors and integrate that whole assembly and allows the customers to have a better vibration proof and a more kind of certainty of the application than they would have had in the past. That\u2019s a very, very long term trend that we see and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re really at the forefront of working with leading customers around the world on enabling. Previously, we had that capability predominantly in North America and the Invotec acquisition gives us that high value-add, high technology opportunity to support customers also in Europe. And so it\u2019s very, very much consistent with that strategy. You could call it a little bit of a niche strategy in that broader printed circuit area, but it\u2019s very complementary to our overall value-add interconnect offering to those customers. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Diana, I just wanted to bridge the full-year revenue guidance versus what you\u2019ve said a couple of months ago to what you\u2019re saying now. It looks like you add the acquisition back. You add the modestly [ph], you had this quarter and then you take out the FX impact, it\u2019s mostly the same guidance. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding that correctly, it seems like mostly that changes the acquisition and FX impact. Diana Reardon : Sure. I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it. I think at the high end, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the same guidance adjusted for FX impact and adding in the Invotec acquisition. And from a low end of guidance, we\u2019ve increased the range from 2% to 5% organic growth to 3% to 5%. So I think the way you\u2019ve described is correct. Sherri Scribner : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just for the second quarter guidance, it seems a little \u2013 it seems like the seasonality is a bit less than you would typically see. Usually you see sales increased sort of in the mid-single-digit. On a sequential basis, what\u2019s really driving that? And then I guess, what\u2019s the strengths that drives growth in the second half of the year? Obviously, mobile devices to some extent, I just want to get a little more color. Thanks. Diana Reardon : Sure. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect in the second quarter to look sequentially. We expect not to see the normal sequential increase in the wireless market. The wireless network market, due to the fact that we now see a year-over-year decline in that market and I think Adam just described pretty well what is going on there. In terms of the mobile device market, we actually do have a more positive view of that market and expect now that that market will be up in the mid-single-digit \u2013 range for the year. But in the second quarter, due to program timing, again we expect that market to be flat. And then as we move into Q3 and Q4, the second half of the year, we expect to see a significant strengthening in that market. And that\u2019s why you see a little bit less than what our normal sequential seasonality would be in Q2 and we\u2019ll have a little bit higher than normal seasonality if you will when we move into Q3 in the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, kind of going back to the first question is on mobile, twofold on devices, am I correct, is it solely content gains which give you the bullish view on the second half of the year versus a better volume outlook for the device market? And then, second on networks, is it \u2013 is there an inventory issue of Amphenol products or is it that there\u2019s an inventory issue of end products being put into the market? I just wanted to be clear on that versus just lack of deployment of base stations and associated equipment for the year. Adam Norwitt : Shawn, thank you very much. Just relative to mobile devices, it\u2019s hard for us to always say is it content gains? Is it new wins on new programs? Is it more content on programs that we already had content? I think the best is to say that we\u2019re doing an excellent job of maximizing our content on as many devices as we can, and we have a lot of devices in the space. So to sort of parse it out and say which is content and which is totally new things and which are volume expectations. But I think that the team is just doing a fabulous job to gain position on coming programs in which we have a lot of confidence as well on programs that we really start to see and start to really see in the pipeline. Relative to mobile networks, I mean, I don\u2019t know necessarily that I would call it an inventory although there certainly may be end inventory in the channel, of base stations and things like that. I mean, that\u2019s very common when you have a big capital spending year followed by some reductions and that some of the equipment manufacturers may very well have some inventory. But I think if you just look at the capital spending plan that are widely reported, there are many of those that do reflect some significant downturns. I think there are some of those operators as well who are also involved in some of these broadly reported corporate mergers and whether that is keeping some governor on their spending plans. That\u2019s something they know that I don\u2019t know. But there are certainly some moving pieces going on strategically in the industry. I think all that being said, we feel that our position in that space, that our position with customers is really stronger than it was before and one thing I\u2019ll say is when you look at our performance last year, we did such a fabulous job in a time of high growth than demand to satisfy customers. They don\u2019t forget that. They really don\u2019t forget it. And so when that spending comes, and it will come, they will always remember who was there for them and who reacted quickly, who didn\u2019t caused their crews to not have the parts when they needed them in the field. And that will reflect positively on our ability to continue to gain position in the mobile networks market long-term. Shawn Harrison : Very helpful, and if I may just may one brief follow-up, it seems as if private party multiples \u2013 private market multiples on sensor companies has gone a bit sky-high over the past six to 12 months, is that anyway change your thinking about the opportunities in that market near-term knowing that you guys are typically a very stood acquirer? Adam Norwitt : Pretty safe to compliment look we\u2019re not a bottom feeder, we are still an acquirer, we pay fair multiple for a good companies and we have bought many companies in many different valuation cycles. So whether there are a few data points over the last twelve months that reflect may be higher multiples than we would necessarily have paid, does that change the landscape for Amphenol? Absolutely not, we continue to have a fabulous reputation among sellers, both financial sponsor sellers, as well as real owner, managers of companies. As a company that does what it says, keeps it word, executes quickly, pays a fair price and is a fabulous home ultimately for those companies. And I think that that\u2019s the one who pays only the highest price doesn\u2019t win in every instance. There are some instances where they do win and if someone wants to pay a much higher price than us, in certain occasions, we\u2019ll be happily not buying those companies. But I think that there still remain a lot opportunities for us to acquire great companies using our consistent methodology which hasn\u2019t changed over the years. And we have not chased kind of market multiples as you know very well, regardless of what cycle that we\u2019re in. We view this as a real long-term game. When you\u2019re buying a company you\u2019re buying it in our world that leads for life. And you don\u2019t sort of buy opportunistically when things are cheap and not buy when things are expensive and you don\u2019t only buy because of short-term dynamics that are at play. We feel very confident that long-term we are going to continue to be successful across the broad range of companies that we want to acquire that includes interconnect as well as sensor companies. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Diana, I just wanted to bridge the full-year revenue guidance versus what you\u2019ve said a couple of months ago to what you\u2019re saying now. It looks like you add the acquisition back. You add the modest beat that you had this quarter and then you take out the FX impact. It\u2019s mostly the same guidance. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding that correctly. It seems like mostly the change is the acquisition and FX impact. Diana Reardon : Sure. I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it. I think at the high end, that\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s the same guidance adjusted for FX impact and adding in the Invotec acquisition. And from a low end of guidance, we\u2019ve increased the range from 2% to 5% organic growth to 3% to 5%.

But in the second quarter, due to program timing, again we expect that market to be flat. And then as we move into Q3 and Q4, the second half of the year, we expect to see a significant strengthening in that market. And that\u2019s why you see a little bit less than what our normal sequential seasonality would be in Q2 and we\u2019ll have a little bit higher than normal seasonality if you will when we move into Q3 in the second half of the year.

Adam Norwitt : Well, I appreciate the complement. Look, we are not a bottom feeder. We are a stood acquirer. We paid fair multiples for good companies and we have bought many companies and many different valuation cycles. So, whether there are a few data points over the last 12 months that reflect maybe higher multiples than we would necessarily have paid because that changed the landscape for Amphenol, absolutely not. We continue to have a fabulous reputation amongst sellers, both financial sponsor sellers as well as real owner, owner, managers of companies, as a company that does what it says, keeps its word, executes quickly, pays a fair price, and is a fabulous home ultimately for those companies. And I think that thus the one who pays only the highest price doesn\u2019t win in every instance. There are some instances where they do win.

And you don\u2019t just sort of buy opportunistically when things are cheap and not buy when things are expensive. And you don\u2019t \u2013 you only buy because of short-term dynamics that are at play. We feel very confident that long term we\u2019re going to continue to be successful across the broad range of companies that we want to acquire that includes interconnect as well as center companies. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Two questions from me, one, Adam, I was wondering if you can just touch on this mobile devices trend that you expect in the back half of, is there a lot of breadth to the strength that you guys are expecting or is it really driven by one or two customers because this is historically at least being a fairly volatile part and for you guys in the past. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how good the breadth is from a customer basis on the back half. Adam Norwitt : Well, look, I think we\u2019ve always said and I wouldn\u2019t say anything different this year that our breadth in that market is relatively reflective of the overall breadth of who is successful and who\u2019s not successful in the space. And so, I think, I wouldn\u2019t say anything different about our outlook for this year. It is a market where there are always winners and losers of the day. And sometimes those are different winners and different losers of yesterday and different winners and different losers of tomorrow. But it is a relatively concentrated market as it relates to who\u2019s winning at a given moment. And I think from that standpoint, our guidance is consistent with how we have always approached that market. I think we have a strong position across a lot of different products, product types as well. I mean, it\u2019s not just phones, it\u2019s not just tablets, it\u2019s not just ultrabooks, I mean, there\u2019s accessories and other things that go along with those. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job on their continued mission to diversify our presence in that space, as best one can in the space where there are always winners and losers. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then just on the automotive side, your revenue growth, the organic trends have been well ahead of what I think order production in content number would suggest. So, if we could just talk a little bit of what\u2019s driving that? And then, are you starting to get benefits from cross-selling opportunities with the GE sensor assets you guys acquired? Is that something tangible difference in your revenue line over there? Adam Norwitt : Yes it\u2019s a very great point. I mean, we\u2019re just so proud of this market and how that\u2019s performed. I mean, just to think over the last, half a decade here. I mean six years ago, Q1 of 2009, this market was 5%, 6% of sales and here it is this quarter, 18% of sales. Really, a historical high for us across that balanced diversification that we have. And I think if I look at why we continue to outperform, I mentioned in my remarks earlier, that we really see two main pillars of that. One is we\u2019ve made a lot of great acquisitions. And over the course of the last five years, we\u2019ve acquired just a great range of really interesting, really high technology, high performance companies ranging from companies that are involved in field connectors to companies involved in automotive lighting to companies involved in data com and power connectivity in the car to sensor companies. And I think that those acquisitions have really rounded out our high value product offering, at the same time as the other pillar has been a real focus on organic growth and driving products into new applications in the car, not trying to take share from the traditional players but really capitalizing on new applications, new electronics, new functionalities that comes into the car. And so ultimately, as it gets to that sort of cross-selling, automotive is not a market where things slip on a dime. At the same time, if I think over the last five years, have we benefited from cross-selling of some of those acquisitions that we have brought on and have those become drivers of really renewed organic growth for the company? No question about it. But that does take time. And so, now to your question of does the sensor company which we acquired 16 months ago in the case of Advanced Sensors or Casco, roughly less than half a year ago, have those started to create meaningful material impacts to sales? I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re material impacts to sales, when I say that we have seen meaningful progress in finding those opportunities, absolutely. When do those ultimately translate into kind of moving the needle on a revenue standpoint? There is a certain time horizon to that in the automotive industry, whatever that may be, once in three years. And I fully expect given the great progress that our team has managed to achieve, that we will see that impact long-term. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that our results this quarter have any meaningful impact from cross-selling of sensors, but they clearly have meaningful impact from cross-selling of other things that we\u2019ve acquired over the last six years. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Mark Delaney : Great. Good afternoon and thanks so much for taking my questions. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Mark Delaney : For the first question, Adam, I was hoping you could help provide some perspective on some of the trends you\u2019re seeing in the industrial end market and I know you commented on weakness in the oil and gas area specifically as you had anticipated, but I wanted to see if you\u2019ve seen slowdown in any of your other industrial end markets given some of the weaker data points we\u2019ve seen this earnings season from some of the big industrial companies. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well thank you very much. Obviously, we did talk about oil and gas and I think that\u2019s the real sort of the industrial market, the one that\u2019s no doubt in the headlines with the broadly reported price of oil and the resulting slowdown in some of the drilling, and extraction and the exploration activities there. And like anybody else, we\u2019re not immune to that slowdown and that had certainly had some impact. I mean fortunately for us, we\u2019re not leveraged on to one or another part of the industrial market. We have a very diversified industrial market across things like heavy equipment, alternative energy, lighting, machine tool, factory automation, rail mass transit. And I think I mentioned where we saw really the strength in the quarter. We saw that great strength in heavy equipment and that heavy equipment strength was not just because of some acquisition that we made with Goldstar, but also we saw outstanding performance in heavy equipment organically where we\u2019ve just made great progress really in taking stronger position with customers in the off-road and heavy equipment market. We\u2019ve seen fantastic performance in alternative energy where our team there has just done such a fabulous job in what is not an easy market. I mean, solar and wind energy and the other sort of ancillary alternative energies. Some of those can be very tough markets, but we have an organization that just focuses on that space, drives costs down, and takes share with important customers around the world. And they\u2019ve done a great job. We\u2019ve done a great job in things like lighting and machine tool, as well. I think the only space where we maybe saw a little bit of downturn besides oil and gas, wasn\u2019t quite as robust in factory automation although in local currencies, it was relatively flat. But otherwise, I think we\u2019ve seen pretty broad-based growth in our industrial market. Mark Delaney : Yes. Thanks. I appreciate the perspective there. And for a follow-up question on gross margins, I know gross margins have gone back to 32% which is a good number and I think that\u2019s been a level that are high after several years. I think the last time you guys were there were at 2010, 2011. As you look out into the second half of the year, if we think about mobile device revenue mix maybe increasing, is that something that\u2019s going to put some downward pressure on gross margin or are there other things that can maybe offset what I would expect would maybe be some mix headwinds for 2H? Diana Reardon : I think that we would more talk about operating income margin. I think as we\u2019ve said before on prior calls, we really don\u2019t manage the gross margin or the SG&A line. We look at operating income margin and I think that they are within the market we participate in they are certainly to your point, a different mix of gross margin and SG&A, but it\u2019s the operating income, I think, that we all care about at the end of the day. From an operating income standpoint, we had certainly very good performance here in the first quarter in line with what our expectations are. We had a very strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales. I think the guidance as we\u2019ve laid that out has again good conversion margins in the remainder of the year. It implies an increase in ROS levels as we go through the year, and so, we feel very good about what the trajectory of that profitability will be during 2015 and that fully incorporates that mix that you refer to with a stronger mobile device market in the second half. So again, we feel very good about the profitability profile that we expect to see in 2015 and expansion in ROS levels. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is open. Amitabh Passi : Hi, guys. Adam, I have a couple of questions on the IT data com segment. Looks like sales are sort of stabilizing over the last three quarters or so, just wondering, are you starting to see somewhat stability with your OEM customers or do you continue to see your business skew more towards the web-scale companies? Adam Norwitt : Yes, thank you very much, Amitabh. I think stabilized, we\u2019re happy to see actually pretty strong growth in that space this quarter. We grew 7% for the year. I think I guided that we expect to have that IT data com grow mid-single digits for the year and I think we\u2019re doing that at a time when you continue to not see such robust growth at least coming out of the publicly traded hardware OEMs around the world. So I think from that standpoint, we are \u2013 really continue to gain position in the IT data com space. There is no question that we have really expanded our activities around working with, as you call it, the web-scale providers or we call it kind of the data center web service provider customer base. And I think that\u2019s a real pivot that we have had to make and in typical Amphenol fashion, that\u2019s a pivot that we make very quickly because that\u2019s kind of one of the great advantages of our entrepreneurial organization is that agility that we\u2019re able to exercise. We don\u2019t have to kind of completely restructure ourselves to pivot towards a new trend in that market. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we do see in the IT datacom market, quite a significant transformation happening and I think I call it kind of a re-architecting almost of how you work in that IT datacom space, and I just think our team has done a fantastic job in capitalizing upon that, not just reacting to it, but really capitalizing upon that change. I think where we have seen real progress is in our real leading offering of high speed products, as well as with our outstanding power solutions that go into that market, and the high speed, no doubt about it, is such a critical feature. Whether you are a traditional OEM, a traditional enterprise data center or a web service provider, the amount of data that people are trying to crank through their systems and really pump out is just increasing at phenomenal, phenomenal rates. I mean I see it in my own TV. I had a technician in my house last night because I can barely watch Netflix right now because it\u2019s just stopping and starting all the time and it just shows me again the phenomenal potential and the growth that is coming, and here I am, I\u2019m watching Netflix at most an hour a week, and for that one hour, if it stops and starts, it really is frustrating. And there\u2019s real value that is created for the end customers and thereby for the operators and the equipment manufacturers by creating high speed solutions that ultimately can support a much better pipe of data. And so I think from that standpoint, it\u2019s a question of really that pivoting towards the new reality of the market together with the continued investment of our leading high speed and power products that have positioned us for the growth that we\u2019ve seen this quarter and that we expect this year. Amitabh Passi : That was helpful, Adam. And just a quick follow-up, there\u2019s some excitement in the market around standardizing 25-gig. Is that a meaningful needle mover for you guys, or in the grand scheme of things, would have been noise [ph] I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how big 25-gig could be potentially for your business. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, 25-gig is something we\u2019ve actually been developing, inhibiting for I don\u2019t know, feels like almost eight years now, that we\u2019ve been talking about creating and have created interconnect solutions to support 25-gig. The reality is, we\u2019re working on interconnect solutions just well beyond 25-gig. And one of the reasons for that is, that the interconnect sometimes outlast the silicon in these devices. I mean you can imagine an environment where boxes are being built and they want to change our cards in that box with the latest speed upgrade. But you got to still put it through the connectors that are residing, for example, in the backplane or the midplane of such a system. And so, we have always pride ourselves on creating high speed solutions that gives headroom beyond where the customers want to go in today. And so, it\u2019s true that there\u2019s maybe a lot of more publicized talk about 25-gig. For us, we\u2019re talking about things like 56-gig and 100-gig and beyond right now because we need to think far in advance such that when our customers design our product into their core architecture, they\u2019ve got room to expand in the future. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Group. Your line is open. Mike Wood : Hi. Good afternoon. First question on order growth, can you just remind us \u2013 you were looking for that end market for the full year. I think you may have mentioned low double-digit previously. And with the growth rates in auto be primarily determined by product launches or is it really customer decisions with upgrading to a specific add-ons when they make the car purchase? Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Mike. Yes. I think we have guided for that market to be growing in the low-double-digit. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve given specific number, but it\u2019s somewhere in the low-teens I would estimate organically\u2026 Diana Reardon : Organic. Yes. Adam Norwitt : Yes, from organic. Obviously, we have much higher expectations because of the acquisitions that we made last year. I think we would see in a local currency basis growth sort of more in the kind of 25%, 30% range for the year. Relative to timing, you have a couple of dynamics in play. Certainly, we have good content on new platforms and many times you work for many years on a new system that\u2019s integrated into a new platform and that has a certain ramp cycle to it. But in addition to that, what we have started to see more of over the recent years is what I would call mid-cycle upgrades. And those mid-cycle upgrades would be things like lighting and onboard electronics where the electronics industry is just moving in a much faster pace than the automotive industry has traditionally moved. And I think the auto companies have recognized that there are certain feature sets in the car that they can\u2019t wait five years for a platform upgrade to implement. I mean, you\u2019d see it even in any car you drive, you buy it with a GPS system and within six months, that GPS already feels kind of old and clergy [ph]. And I think that that is the dynamic that the car companies they\u2019re really facing up too quickly. And so we have seen a few more of what I would call mid-platform upgrades which don\u2019t coincide with that traditional kind of second half of the year product launch that you would normally see in car companies. And so I think that it\u2019s maybe not quite as magnified to those platform launches as it has been traditionally. Mike Wood : Great, and then more than 30% conversion in March on the interconnect business, was that upside relative to your long-term goals from the improvement on the acquired companies notably Advanced Sensors. So does that have a similar impact embedded in our 2Q guidance? Diana Reardon : Sure. I think from a year-over-year standpoint, that\u2019s 32% conversion margin had contributions from both of those things. So I think to your point the acquisition program did come along very well during 2014 as we talked about last year and coming into this year, so there is a positive impact there. But the base business or the core business also performed very well from an operational and execution standpoint on that incremental volume. And so I think we\u2019re getting a contribution from both of those things that you\u2019re seeing in the Q1 profitability level. And I would say as we work our way through 2015, I think, that would also be true where we expect both our base business and the acquired companies to continue to execute well and to continue to move up that scale from a profitability perspective. Operator : Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions from me, one, just a quick check on your DSOs being up four days for the quarter. I wasn\u2019t quite clear on whether you were saying that there\u2019s a slightly higher level or whether you think that number comes down in the next couple of quarters. And then secondly, Adam, can you just talk a little bit more about the broadband business given it\u2019s never been a huge growth area for you organically and some of the things you just talked about seem to suggest that it could be headed for some more muted growth for a while and you have fixed costs that are, my understanding is very well associated just with that business. What is it that that keeps you in it today versus maybe looking out a year or two? Diana Reardon : Maybe I\u2019ll just start with the DSO question. Steven Fox : Yes. Thank you. Diana Reardon : To your point and as I said, the DSO was at the high end of our normal range at the end of Q1 and DSO and payable days are a little bit harder because you can get the end of the quarter sometimes and if you do have a day or two either way. But I think that over time, we would expect, I think, that to come back down more to the midpoint of our range and it can range anywhere from 70 days to 77 days probably at the end of a quarter. But we would expect that that would work its way back down towards that midpoint. Adam Norwitt : Yes. And, Steve, relative to the broadband business, it\u2019s true that right now we would certainly prefer to have them more robust growth outlook for the business, and last year that business was slightly down on a year-over-year basis. Why are we in that business? And I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll just reiterate it today, we believe that it\u2019s very important for the company to participate in all aspects of the electronics industry and that includes in all aspects of how people get Internet and high speed data. And the broadband remains one of the top ways that high speed data is delivered to homes and businesses around this country and many others. And we have just an outstanding position in that space, and I think our team has done an excellent job to diversify our products such that we\u2019re no longer simply just a cable on a real company that we were many years ago. It\u2019s very true that right now that industry is going through a lot of change. I mean, you have the very widely reported mergers that are still lingering and delayed. Then who knows ultimately whether they get approved. You can imagine that that causes a pause in the purchasing activities of customers. But we saw a very similar dynamic for close to three years in our wireless networks business, and I talked all along about the fact that there was building, a pent-up demand in the wireless networks market, and ultimately, that pent-up demand which we continue to focus on gaining position, we continue to position on gaining technology breadth in that space, ultimately, last year, we were able to realize fantastic growth in that space as the operators ultimately realized that they had to satisfy some of that pent-up demand. What kind of pent-up demand is being created in the broadband space? I mean I can only speak out of personal anecdotes of how terrible that service is in certain areas and you can imagine that as that business shakes out, in particularly in the United States, that one could imagine a scenario where the build-out activity strengthens again. And we\u2019re not a company that is just living by the short-term of what\u2019s happening in that market in a given year. We have long-term conviction that it\u2019s great to be in a space where we have a high technology, leadership position in an area that is delivering one of the best delivery systems for high speed data that anyone knows today. So what will it be this year? We have a more muted expectation. We anticipate a little bit of growth this year. What will it end up being next year? Time will tell. But one day, will there be a necessity for investment in that space, an investment where Amphenol will be a participant in that? We certainly have that long-term conviction. Steven Fox : Fair enough. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. Adam, question on the sensors business. If you think through the strategy there, can you give a little context in terms of how much is push versus pull in terms of some of your customers perhaps pulling you into discussions in terms of what you can offer at this point and what the implications are for the growth there? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean, look, I \u2018m not going to tell you that in any of our businesses, customers just come screaming and knock down the door. I mean, we got people out there knocking lots of doors. And so, in every one of our business, we\u2019re going to push hard and that\u2019s true certainly in the sensor business, as well. I think to the extent that there is a pull, it\u2019s a pull that happened internally in Amphenol, where we have fabulous relationships with certain customers in certain segments of either the industrial or the automotive market in particular where we don\u2019t have a sensor relationship. And through that wonderful dialogue that we have with our ongoing relationship from an interconnect standpoint, we pull in the sensor team to talk about a collaborative drive whether that is a new integrated product, or whether that is just a totally new product that the customers says, hey, now that you have that sensor, let\u2019s talk. What\u2019s the genesis of that conversation? Is that the customer taking up to notice there is it our sales person promoting it or our engineering team promoting it, I have a hard time to say which is push and which is pull. But no question there\u2019s a lot of dialogue happening at customers across those spaces. And the customers that I have had the good fortune to visit, they just are really happy that a company in whom they have so much confidence like Amphenol, now can offer them a broader solution of interconnect, of sensors and of antennas, which are all products that are real growth areas for customers in most of those spaces. You talked about something like the Internet of Things which is a very often bantered about, almost clich\u00e9 these days. Ultimately, this Internet of Things as it\u2019s reflected in places like industrial and automotive and otherwise, is a network of sensors with antennas and interconnect on them. And there\u2019s very few companies very, very few who can say they\u2019re really a leader in all three spaces and that\u2019s something that we can say very strongly to our customers around the world. And I think ultimately that will create long-term value for the company and for those customers. And does it start with a push or a pull, it doesn\u2019t really matters as much as in the end that we win it. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Maybe just a follow-up there since you mentioned kind of integrated product. Can you talk about just the design engineer teams working together now and how you envision that as you look out over a couple of years in terms of where the technology might go? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean, you know very well, Craig, having covered the company for awhile that we have still a very simple organization which general managers who run their organizations and they have full accountability and authority to run their businesses and all the functions report up into those businesses. And so, we don\u2019t have an integrated engineering organization across Amphenol. What we do have is a very successful approach towards collaborating across those companies. And so, to the extent that these integrated products happen, it\u2019s through that collaboration that will come, for example, between an engineer working in our sensor organization and an engineer working in one of the other operations, be that in industrial or automotive or otherwise. And the real question comes is how do you stimulate those dialogues and identify them. And that\u2019s where our group executives and our management team comes into play so much, which is making sure that we are incubating those dialogues on a frequent basis, facilitating them and identifying them as appropriate such that we can put those engineers in a room together and get the job done. And I think we\u2019ve done that really from day one. So one of the very first things we did when we acquired Advanced Sensors and then later when we acquired Casco, was to get a bunch of engineers in a room together to meet each other, number one, and to exchange kind of, hey, this is what I do, tell me what you do, kind of you show me yours, I show you mine. And that initiation of the relationship was something that we took the opportunity very early to do and that has already started to pay great dividends through some of the collaborative activities that we\u2019ve seen. So I think that long term, to the extent that customers have a desire and a need for those integrated products and we think they will and we see them already having that, I think our engineering teams will work very well collaboratively still within the basic Amphenol operating structure but in a way that can be very effective to solve those problems for customers. Operator : Okay. Next question comes from the line of Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open. Will Stein : Thank you for taking my question. Two quick ones, first in the wireless infrastructure end market, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything meaningful from the small cells this year? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think we are very much participating in small cells, and I couldn\u2019t break down how much of our sales are resulting from small cells, but is there something meaningful? Yes. I would say that there is something meaningful in small cells as the capital spending of some of our operator customers, in particular, shifts a bit from macro towards a bit \u2013 towards small and microcells. But we certainly would benefit from that because we have a great product offering that covers that both from an interconnect, as well as an antenna perspective. Will Stein : Great. And then, in the industrial, that broad based industrial end market, I want to follow up on a question that\u2019s asked earlier. Often I think we as analysts try to look at results of some of the biggest industrial companies and try to draw conclusions from their results to those of Amphenol and others. And I\u2019m wondering if that \u2013 if you think that\u2019s a reasonable way for us to anticipate demand shifts in this end market or, perhaps, is much of your demand really coming from either private companies or companies that we might not have a good view of because of their size? Any characterization trying to line up those two, let\u2019s say, the results of the big companies and your results would be really helpful. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Will, I would love to be able to help you make a model for the industrial market, but I think I would fail miserably. You\u2019d do a much better job than I would. Our industrial business is so diversified. And so to look at maybe, for example, a diversified industrial company, I mean, there\u2019s a pretty big one down the road here in Connecticut and say, is that a proper proxy for the industrial outlook for Amphenol. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that that would be the most highly effective approach to that. And we work across so many segments of industrial. Ultimately, what ties these industrial markets together is that their applications that tend to go into areas which are a little bit dirtier, a little bit more tricky to deal with, they tend to have to last a long time. But I mean, you\u2019re talking about applications as diverse as solar cells and high-speed rail, factory automation, oil and gas, things that may \u2013 companies that make earthmovers and tractors, lighting and next-generation lighting, medical. I mean, do those have necessarily the same cadence to them, those spaces, or is there one or two sort of proxy big companies where one can say, well, that\u2019s going to drive it, not necessarily. And I think there\u2019s another element, too, which is the same dynamic that we talked about in automotive which is the expansion of new electronic feature set in that space. Means that you can\u2019t just say how many more cars are built this year and that\u2019s what are the revenues of Amphenol or Amphenol\u2019s peers going to be in that space. You have the very same dynamic that happens in industrial. There is this what I \u2013 so, not is a very easy to say word but kind of an electronification that\u2019s happening across the industrial market and all those spaces that I referred to, where something, for example, that used to be a hydraulic or a mechanically driven feature on a tractor now becomes electronic, or where a train that used to only need power to connect between the cars now need the whole suite of fiber optics, and digital, and power, and RF and other aspects, or where a train network now has to be tracked through the whole wireless system, something like a positive train control. I mean I can go on and on about that migration that\u2019s happening in the industrial market away from hydraulics and mechanics and towards electronics, which is the same thing we\u2019ve seen in commercial areas, the same thing we\u2019ve seen in military, it\u2019s the same thing we\u2019ve seen in automotive whereby it\u2019s very hard to just take the overall equipment sales and then put that as a template for what one should expect for Amphenol. I think clearly, our performance over these years has reflected a very different trajectory than one would have seen in overall GDP year overall industrial performance. Will Stein : Great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much Will. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Diana, you noted that inventory was a little higher than normal to support future builds. So in light of the fact that guidance is roughly flat sequentially, what end market is this targeting, why is it typically higher this quarter? And I have a follow-up. Diana Reardon : Sure. I think we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get into inventory by end market, but I think our guidance is, from an organic standpoint, about 3% growth sequentially so it\u2019s not exactly flat but I think that some of this build is not necessarily just for Q2, but also to some extent, goes into the second half of next year. That being said, I mean, inventory is a little bit higher but it\u2019s still at the high end of the normal range that the company has had if you go back over the last few years. So, it\u2019s not an astronomical build in inventory that we\u2019re talking about here. And I think as I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we would expect as we go through the year, that inventory would come back down at least to the midpoint of the range from a day\u2019s perspective historically. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks for that Diana. And then, if I\u2019m looking at this right, your guidance implies some organic deceleration in the second quarter, reacceleration again on the second half, despite some slightly tougher compares in the back half. So, is it fair to think that the puts and takes are largely the mobile network comments you alluded to in 2Q and then the mobile device ramp in 3Q that\u2019s creating this dynamic, or are there additional drivers of acceleration that you have confidence in 3Q and further Diana Reardon : Sure. I think if you look at the guidance and think about why it\u2019s different than perhaps what you\u2019d expect from a normal seasonality standpoint, I think it\u2019s exactly those two markets that you just mentioned. It\u2019s the fact that the wireless markets, which would ordinarily be up sequentially in Q2 for the reasons I already explained. We don\u2019t expect that and then we do expect a pretty significant sequential uptick in the mobile device market in the second half of the year. And that does happen from time to time. If you go back historically, you can find other years where that\u2019s happened. Then I think as Adam has described on many of these calls before, it just tends to be a lumpy type of business depending on timing of program introductions and that kind of things. But it is \u2013 those two markets that are giving the 2015 sequential seasonality a bit different look than perhaps what it has been in the past. Operator : Okay. At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Speakers, you may proceed. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much. And again I thank you all for your attention today and I hope that spring has come as it has here at Wallingford, Connecticut, to all of you and we look forward to speaking to you again in a short three months. Thank you very much. Diana Reardon : Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. And have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Adam Norwitt. Sir, you may begin. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much and I'd like to offer my greetings to everybody on the call here today. Thank you very much for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I am Adam Norwitt, CEO of the company and I'm here together today on a very special day with Craig Lampo who is here for his first earnings call as our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings were released this morning and in a moment Craig is going to provide some financial commentary on the quarter. And then I will follow-up with an overview of the business and current trends. And certainly at the end we will have a question-and-answer session as well. But before going into the results I'd like to first introduce Craig Lampo who has been formally appointed as Amphenol's Chief Financial Officer effective yesterday, July 21. And this has followed a very smooth transition period working together with Diana Reardon. And I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude to Diana, who has stepped down as CFO after more than 10 years in the role. During that time, as well as during her more than 27 years so far with the company, Diana has made tremendous contributions to the performance of Amphenol. It has been such a pleasure to work with her as CFO and I am especially pleased that Diana will remain strongly connected to Amphenol, both as a senior advisor to me and now as a member of our Board of Directors, to which she was appointed yesterday. Craig Lampo assumes the role of CFO after serving also more than 10 years as our Vice President and Corporate Controller. During that time Craig has worked hand-in-hand with Diana and me to drive the performance of the company and thereby has gained an intimate appreciation of our strategy, operations and the financial management of the company. But most importantly, Craig is a true Amphenolian, steeped deeply in the unique culture of this fine company. And I personally look forward to continuing to work even more closely with Craig in his new role and I'm excited for the long-term positive impact that he will no doubt have on Amphenol's performance. So I would like to please ask you to join me in extending my congratulations both to Diana as our newest Board member and to Craig Lampo as our new Chief Financial Officer. And with that let a me turn it over to Craig for his financial review of the second quarter. Craig, please. Craig Lampo : Thank you, Adam. It is my pleasure to be on the call for the first time and to provide some financial commentary on the quarter. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.351 billion and EPS of $0.58, excluding one-time items, meeting the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the quarter were up 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically from the first quarter. Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 10% from last year primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators as well as the effect of translation. The Interconnect business which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 4% from last year reflecting the benefits of both good organic growth and the company's acquisition program partially offset by translation. Adam will comment further on the trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income increased $266 million excluding one-time items in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, increased to 19.7% compared to 19.5% last year, a strong year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 29%. The increase of 20 basis points in operating margins over the prior year resulted from an increase in operating margins in the Interconnect business. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment margins were 11.8% compared to 12.7% last year primarily as a result of lower volumes. In the Interconnect segment margins were 21.9%, up 30 basis points from 21.6% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution both organically and from our acquisitions, in addition to aggressive cost management. We're very pleased with the company's operating margin achievements. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high-performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in what clearly continues to be a very dynamic environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. The company has recorded acquisition-related costs in the quarter of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share. The costs include professional fees and other external expenses related to the acquisition closed and announced in the quarter. In accordance with the current accounting rules these costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, we do anticipate additional one-time acquisition-related charges in the second half of 2015 related to the previously announced FCI acquisition. These one-time charges will be separately disclosed, as is our practice and are not included in our guidance. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the quarter -- in the current quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is a result of the new note issuance in September 2014 replacing a higher cost note maturity in November 2014 and the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income was $4 million in the second quarter, equal to last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The company's effective tax rate, excluding one-time items, was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2015 as well as the second quarter 2014. On and as reported basis the company's effective tax rate was 27.1% in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding one-time items net income was approximately 14% of sales in the quarter and EPS increased 7%, an excellent performance. On an as reported basis the company achieved EPS of $0.56 which included approximately $6 million or $0.02 of acquisition-related transaction costs as I just discussed. Orders for the quarter were $1.362 billion, up 3% last year resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.01 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $235 million in the quarter or approximately 130% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. And for the six months ended June 30, operating cash flow was $423 million or 117% of net income. From a working capital standpoint inventory was $893 million at the end of June, up approximately 2% from March. Inventory days were 87 excluding acquisition impacts which was flat from March levels and at the higher and of our normal range. The higher inventory level supports future step-ups in certain parts of our business. And we expect inventory days to decline in the second half of the year. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of June. Consistent with March levels, days sales outstanding was 72 days excluding acquisition impacts, down three days from March levels and within our normal range. And accounts payable was $560 million at the end of June, down approximately 4% from March levels. Payable days were 55 days, down three days compared to March levels. The cash flow from operations of $235 million, along with proceeds from stock option exercises of $30 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $81 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $43 million and to fund acquisition payments of $96 million related to the ProCom and DoCharm acquisitions. During the quarter the company repurchased 1.4 million shares under its January 2015, 10 million share stock repurchase program. 7.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017 and as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's Board of Director has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.125 to $0.14 per share, increasing the yield to just over 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1.4 billion. At quarter end the company had issued $758 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program and second quarter 2015 EBITDA was approximately $313 million. From a financial perspective this is certainly an excellent performance. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Craig. It is a pleasure, again, to be here. And I will give some discussion around our second quarter achievements. In particular I plan to discuss the trends and progress in our served markets. I'm also going to make some comments at the end about our third-quarter and our full-year guidance. With respect to the second quarter, Craig has certainly given a very comprehensive overview, but I just wanted to reiterate how pleased I am that we've reported such strong performance in sales and EPS despite what has continued to be a very challenging economic environment. We achieved sales of $1.351 billion, 3% increase from prior year in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currencies. And as Craig mentioned, our book to bill was 1.01 to 1, with the orders of $1.362 billion. We're really pleased with the profitability of the company in the quarter which continued to be very strong at 19.7% operating margins. And pleased, in addition that, our EPS reached the high end of guidance at $0.58, growing 7% or twice the rate of our sales growth. Craig also mentioned the increase in the dividend and, just to reiterate, the 12% increase in the company's dividend to $0.56 per year is really just another great confirmation of the financial strength of Amphenol. I can just say how proud I am of our organization who, despite the many challenges and dynamics in the marketplace, was again able to react quickly and capitalize on opportunities across the diverse array of markets that we serve, all while continuing to exercise the discipline and drive necessary to achieve excellent operating performance. It is just yet again a demonstration of the clear strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial management culture. In the second quarter our small headquarters acquisition team put a lot of work in, really made tremendous progress in the last quarter as we announced the signing of the largest transaction in the company's history while also acquiring at the end of the quarter two outstanding smaller companies. First, as you all know, we announced on June 29 that we had entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire FCI, for $1.275 billion subject to closing adjustments. We were very pleased that as of the end of last week we now have signed a definitive purchase agreement for FCI, the completion of which is subject only to certain regulatory approvals. FCI which expects sales this year of approximately $600 million with an EBITDA margin of 20%, is a real global leader in interconnect solutions for the telecom, Datacom, wireless communications and industrial markets with a broad and complementary array of high speed power, input/output and miniaturized interconnect products. We're particularly excited to add FCI's highly talented team of more than 7,000 employees worldwide to the Amphenol family and I tell you this acquisition is just going to be excellent for Amphenol. We're now going to be able to offer a much wider range of high-technology interconnect solutions to our respective customers across a broad array of end markets while also driving even stronger operating performance. We anticipate closing the acquisition of FCI by the end of this year once we work our way through the various regulatory approvals. Also very pleased in the quarter to have completed the acquisitions of ProCom and DoCharm, both right at the tail end of the second quarter. ProCom is a Denmark-based manufacturer of harsh environment high-technology antennas, primarily for the industrial market, with annual sales of approximately $20 million. ProCom is just an outstanding complement to our very successful global antenna business in the wireless communications markets. And it further strengthens our position as a global leader in RF interconnect and antenna technology, while at the same time broadening our product offering for the worldwide industrial market. DoCharm is a China-based manufacturer of highly engineered interconnect assemblies for the China automotive industry with annual sales of approximately $50 million. In particular, DoCharm is a leader in China in the supply of interconnect assemblies for automotive lighting applications and will be an excellent complement to our already successful position in that segment in the Americas and Europe. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing those companies into the Amphenol family. That remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Turning to the quarter and our trends and progress across our various served markets, I would just point out that once again our balanced and broad end market diversification supported our strong performance in the second quarter. And no single market represented in the quarter more than 19% of our total sales. Turning first to the military market, that market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies due to increases in military helicopter, communications and ordnance related products. On a sequential basis sales were up 2% primarily with the contribution from the Invotec acquisition. Looking ahead to the third quarter we expect sales to continue to increase moderately from these levels and we remain confident in achieving full-year growth in the military market in 2015. While there is no question that overall military spending is not expanding, our technology leadership and broad program participation have enabled us to realize the growth we experienced here in the second quarter. And as adoption of electronics grows across a wide range of military technologies and as spending increases in certain emerging geographies, Amphenol remains extremely well-positioned for the long-term in the military market. The commercial aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were down slightly in local currency and down by about 7% in U.S. dollars on a moderation of demand related in particular to small and business jets and commercial helicopters as well as some impact from aviation subsystems. And this was not totally offset by what we did see as stronger performance of our sales to the major airline producers. Sequentially our sales increased as we had expected by 3%. While we remain confident that our commercial air sales will grow in the third quarter from these second quarter levels due to the anticipated second half ramp up of several new airplane platforms, we expect the overall market to be up slightly in local currencies for the full year. We continue to be extremely well-positioned on the latest generation of airliners with our Interconnect, value add cable and printed circuit assemblies, as well as cable management products. And that strong and broad position creates an exciting long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency versus prior year and 2% in local currency sequentially. This sales increase was driven by a very robust performance in the heavy equipment, instrumentation and alternative energy segments as well as by contributions from the Goldstar acquisition completed at the end of last year. This growth was offset in part by further declines in the oil and gas segment as well as by some moderation of sales to rail mass transit customers. Looking ahead we expect sales in the industrial market to increase from these levels in the third quarter and we do continue to anticipate double-digit sales growth in local currencies for the full year of 2015. Long-term, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our broad industrial interconnect and sensor product offerings together with the newly acquired antenna products of ProCom. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and our sales really increased significantly from prior year. They grew 33% in U.S. dollars, 45% in local currency and a very strong 16% organically. In fact, we grew organically in all geographies. This extremely strong performance reflected the ongoing benefits of the Casco acquisition made last year as well as continued growth of our sales of complex interconnect products used in a wide variety of applications including telematics, safety devices, emissions management as well as drive train control applications. Sales in the automotive market increased sequentially also by a strong 5% from the first quarter. We're very pleased to be continuing to outgrow the overall automotive market as we capitalize on a broadened suite of interconnect and sensor technologies which are being incorporated into a wide array of new advanced vehicle electronics. With the recent addition of DoCharm that I already discussed, we have further strengthened our interconnect position in the China market while also clearly establishing ourselves as the global leader in automotive lighting interconnect. Together with other acquisitions made during the last five years we now have a broad range of high-technology interconnect and sensor products that support a wide array of new electronics applications in cars. In addition, we have become a preferred supplier to a broad range of automobile manufacturers around the world. Looking towards the third quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to increase further from these levels and we continue to look forward to an excellent 2015 and beyond for this exciting business. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. And sales increased by 5% from prior year and by a greater than expected 7% sequentially that was driven really by higher demand across a range of customers and programs. We continue to expect a significant increase of sales in the second half and that includes a sequential increase of approximately 40% in the third quarter, as we anticipate a significant increase of sales of our products in support of certain new programs. For the full year we continue to anticipate growth to be in the mid- to high-single-digits. And we remain confident that despite the ever-changing landscape, as well as the certainly unique dynamics of the mobile devices market, are leading technology, preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device makers and, most importantly, the excellent execution of our outstanding, agile organization positions us strongly for the future in the mobile devices market. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were weaker than expected, declining by 27% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically from prior year and by 7% sequentially as demand further moderated from operators essentially in all regions. While we still expect a second half recovery in spending in the mobile networks market, it now appears that the speed and significance of that recovery may be more muted than we had originally expected. Accordingly, we now expect a high teens percentage decline in our full-year sales in the mobile networks market. But I want to say that regardless of these moderated sales expectations, we continue to be extremely well-positioned in the mobile networks market and thus remain very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products we will continue to participate broadly in ongoing next generation mobile network deployments wherever they happen around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by 3% from prior year and declined slightly on a sequential basis on lower-than-expected sales of storage-related products. Compared to last year our robust sales into servers were offset in part by a weaker performance in networking and storage. Looking ahead towards the third quarter, while we expect sales to remain essentially at these levels in the third quarter, we continue to remain confident to achieve full-year growth in the mid-single-digits in the IT datacom market. As data consumption and processing requirements continue to accelerate, the IT datacom market is undergoing a real rapid transformation. And that transformation is in particular around the cloud and web service providers who are driving just accelerated innovations across the entire architecture of data centers around the world. It is really in just such a dynamic environment that our industry-leading products, high-technology as they are, our preferred relationships with leading equipment suppliers, as well as our very strong focus on service provider and data center customers directly have created an excellent platform for Amphenol to outperform in the IT datacom market. The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in this space was a bit softer than expected as U.S. and Latin America cable operators constrain their spending and with sales declining about 7% from prior year and remaining essentially flat to the first quarter. While we expect an increase in demand in the third quarter we expect for the full year relatively flat performance now for the broadband market. There continues to remain a heightened level of uncertainty in the capital spending plans of many of the multi-service operators, satellite and telco customers in the broadband space. And that is in particular given the several high profile industry mergers which are still pending, as well as the significance of currency devaluations that have occurred in Latin America. Nevertheless and despite these market dynamics, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers to support the rapid growth in high-speed data delivery. And as we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leadership position in the broadband market. So just to summarize the second quarter, I can only say how proud I am of our organization as once again our team executed extremely well in what has become a somewhat more challenging and dynamic market environment. Our continued strong performance in 2015 is a clear reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; and our lean and flexible cost structure. Above all of these strengths though our greatest asset remains Amphenol's agile, entrepreneurial management team who reinforces that high-performance culture every day. Now turning to our outlook, the global marketplace remains a highly uncertain environment. Based on a continuation of these current economic conditions and assuming that exchange rates remain stable at their current levels, we now expect in the third quarter and for the full year 2015 the following. For the third quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.435 million to $1.475 million and EPS in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 respectively. This represents a sales increase of 6% to 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% to 13% in local currency, as well as an EPS increase of 10% to 14% in the quarter. For the full year 2015 we expect sales in the range of $5.540 million to $5.620 million, an increase of 4% to 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% to 9% in local currencies and 3% to 4% organically. For EPS we expect for 2015, $2.43 to $2.47, an increase of 8% to 10% over 2014 excluding one-time items. We're very encouraged by the company's continued strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given those many uncertainties that are still around the global marketplace. It is clear that the ongoing revolution in electronics continues to create tremendous opportunities for Amphenol. I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to continue to capitalize on these opportunities both to grow our market position and expand our profitability and thereby to drive continued superior performance for Amphenol in 2015 and beyond. And operator, at this time we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question came from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : I have a question and a follow-up. On mobile devices, Adam, you're looking for 40% sequential growth in September. That is probably stronger growth than you have seen for the last several years in September. Maybe you can talk about is it units that you think are going up or is it content for you guys that is driving this much conviction that you can do that? And baked into your full-year numbers how do you think December plays out in mobile devices? Adam Norwitt : I think it is very strong performance. As you know, over the last several years there are some years where the third quarter is very strong and other years where the fourth quarter is very strong. But no doubt about it, the second half is usually very strong in the mobile device segment; I think this year is no different. As we look towards the third quarter we see really a variety of levers of growth here. And that includes units, that includes content that includes really expansion of the various products that we're offering into the market. We sell such a broad suite of products into that market, everything from antennas and interconnect to mechanisms and even products that go onto the devices as well as products that go to support our customers in their production processes. And so, there is just a real wide array of products that we're selling onto a wide array of applications with a diverse range of customers. Relative to the December quarter, I think you can do the math that we would anticipate at this point that the December quarter would be sequentially down a bit from the third quarter. Again, there are some years where the third quarter is stronger than the fourth and other years where the fourth quarter is stronger than the third. It is not a market that I would ever want to give long-term predictions on the various seasonality and cadence of that market. But this year we're very happy to still be in a very strong position. And I would just one more time emphasize, if you look at our performance in this space, over the last several quarters we had a very strong fourth quarter and a very strong second half last year. We had also a very strong -- a reduction in sales in the first quarter -- if I recall correctly it was nearly 30% from the first quarter to the -- from the fourth quarter to the first quarter we grew 7% sequentially last quarter and now we're going to grow 40% into the third quarter, that is not an easy business to run. And I just give so much credit to our organization being able to flex in such an environment. At the end of the day that is one of the greatest competitive advantages that we have in this space. So few can flex at that level in real-time with the needs of the customers, I think ultimately that allows us to get maybe a little bit more than our fair share of the market opportunity. Amit Daryanani : And then if I could just follow up on FCI. Could you just talk about what's the historical or the growth rate been for the company for the last few years? And as you integrate this once it closes is it reasonable to say the aspiration when you get closer to the Interconnect margins for Amphenol versus the corporate levels for FCI? Adam Norwitt : Yes, no, it is an excellent question and again we're just very excited about FCI. FCI has just an outstanding business and I wouldn't necessarily talk about specific growth rates, but I would just tell you that they have had good growth over the recent years. It is a company with a very long legacy. It comes for many, many decades over certain iterations and ownerships. And the business today that we're buying is really the core electronics commercial business of FCI. And that is a business that just has done an outstanding job in gaining position across a wide array of products and markets. I mentioned everything from high-speed to power, input-output connectors, miniaturized connectors and has done a great job on a regional basis as well with customers where we don't necessarily have necessarily that strength. And so, as we think about their future, certainly our aspiration for FCI would be for them to perform at or above the levels of Amphenol. Otherwise we would not have bought the company. And as we think about operating performance, today the company clearly does not perform at the levels of Amphenol. As we talked about in the press release, they have EBITDA margins of around 20%, but their operating margins would be more in the low to mid-teens. And we certainly see great opportunities for FCI over a time period certainly, medium to long time period, to bring themselves up to Amphenol level margins. That has been a recipe that we have applied for many years. In fact, we're coming up to the 10th anniversary of the Teradyne Connection Systems or TCS acquisition. Believe it or not that was 10 years ago December that we acquired TCS. And at the time that was a company that didn't perform at the levels that Amphenol aspired to and was able to achieve. And certainly over the years that organization was able, through being part of Amphenol, to really reach towards much higher levels of profitability. And we would certainly have that long-term aspiration for FCI and long-term goals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Amitabh Passi of UBS. Your line is now open. Amitabh Passi : Adam, I just had a couple questions for you. On just FCI, are there any cross-licensing agreements or potential revenue dissynergies that we need to be thinking about? Just maybe an overarching comment there. Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, it is a very good question. There are a couple of licensing arrangements that we have, like we have with many other companies in the industry. But we don't really view that as revenue dissynergies. Those licensing arrangements tend to be relatively -- the second source arrangements tend to have relatively small proportions and we don't see that as any material impact to the business. I mean what we see much more is benefits. When we think about the products and the complementary aspect of those products, as well as the complementary access to customers where there are certain customers where they have done much better and others where we have done much better. And I think being able to bring that full suite of technologies between both those sets of customers is really something that will far outweigh any immaterial revenue kind of dissynergies, as you term it, from cross licensing. Amitabh Passi : And just a quick follow-up, we have heard from a few other companies in the supply-chain, including semiconductor companies, of increasing levels of caution as the order progressed. I am just curious how things potentially trended for you during the quarter. Did you see a slowing in the quarter and essentially how you would characterize the environment today. Adam Norwitt : I think I would characterize the environment as throughout the course of the quarter the macro environment, I would say, felt a little worse at the end of the quarter than it felt at the beginning. That didn't necessarily translate into the results of the company, I would say. I think our team did a fabulous job and we had what I would term a pretty normal cadence throughout the quarter in terms of you tend to have a pretty strong June in the second quarter and that was no different in this quarter, but it was a bit more of a fight, I will tell you that. And I think that the overall market environment continues to have a relatively high degree of uncertainty around it and probably throughout the course of the quarter was a bit higher. Amitabh Passi : Any specific geographies or was that sort of a broad-- Adam Norwitt : No, I would say that it is more broad. I mean, look, I wouldn't -- we're not necessarily a canary in the coal mine for every market and every geography here. But I just think that there is a general sense that there was uncertainty. You have to fight sometimes a little bit harder for the last order. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : I was hoping first, Adam, maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on the strength that you are seeing in the mobile devices end market. I know you talked about how it can be volatile from quarter to quarter, but you mentioned specifically that you are participating in things, some directly involved in the manufacturing process. And I'm just wondering is there a one-time nature to some of those sales or is there something that you would have an opportunity to participate in in future years? Adam Norwitt : Yes, no, look, I think we don't see that as a one-time thing. What I would say is that in the mobile devices market the demand tends to have certain quarters where it is much higher than others. And I don't think that will be any different regardless of whether you are participating on the product side or working with them in the production. There tend to be ramp ups of products, there tend to be ramp ups of production processes and there tend to be then some digestion of those ramp ups. And I think you see that really in the ongoing results of the company over many years where quarter to quarter you have certain quarters that are much stronger in the mobile devices space that tend to be more towards the second half of the year. Not always. I mean we have had in other years where actually the first quarter was not such a bad quarter because there was a certain set of product releases. The cadence of when the activity gets hot and not hot in the mobile devices is something again that doesn't -- that is not entirely predictable in any year, year in and year out. And we don't see that that is a very different dynamic regardless of whether you are selling products that go onto the device or helping to make the device or supporting accessories where we have also a very strong business related to accessories and devices. I think all of those tend to be relatively lumpy and you have got to be in a position where you can strike while the iron is hot, while the opportunity is there. And the better you can be at striking with a real agile organization at that time the more success you can have over the long term. Mark Delaney : And then a second follow-up question if you could just help us to contextualize the FCI acquisition versus the broader M&A program at the company. I mean some of the deals the company has done in recent years, GE, Casco and FCI, have been larger. I mean I think to get to deals of this size you have to go back to the Teradyne Connection Systems business you mentioned from 10 years ago. So there has been a noticeable increase in the size of the M&A. I'm just wondering if you can talk about what other opportunities are there of this sort of deal size, hundreds of millions or billion-dollar type acquisitions. And is that the type of size we should expect the company to be looking to execute on going forward? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Look, I think I have said for many years that we have some very strong criteria for acquisitions. And that is first and foremost technology and we want companies with very, very strong technology. And in addition equal billing with technology is we want outstanding people and then we want that to be complementary to the company. And the criteria that we have never had is size, and I think that while it is true that the FCI acquisition is the largest acquisition we have made in the history of the company in absolute dollars, from a proportional size the TCS acquisition was actually substantially bigger. I think at the time it had sales of close to a third of the size of Amphenol. So I think that we're a bigger company and so we certainly have the capacity to do deals of a wide variety of sizes. In terms of what is out there and what is available and what will be available, it is very hard to say. I mean, there are plenty of companies out there of a certain size. Will they ultimately one day be for sale? There are some that we certainly hope they will be. We're very patient, though. I can tell you that even within FCI, I mean that has been a process of onward close to a decade where we have been knowing that company, having dialogue. And that is very similar to many of the acquisitions that we have made where we develop a very long-term dialogue with those companies. And eventually there comes an inflection point where the owner of the company, be that the owner/operator or in this case the financial owner, decides that they are ready to consider selling that. And I think that there are large companies that are out there. Will those be in the near-term or even medium-term actionable from an acquisition standpoint? That is very hard to say. So it doesn't mean that we won't do acquisitions also of smaller size. As you saw in the quarter, we made two other acquisitions, $20 million in size, $50 million in size. We will continue to pursue a very broad range of acquisition targets all around those criteria of having strong technology outstanding people and complementary market positions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open, sir. Mike Wood : Regarding industrial and just local consumption oriented markets in China, there are two markets where some industrial companies had been reporting softness. Can you just speak to what Amphenol is seeing there? And regarding those trends, has there been any destocking or you think maybe sell-in is underperforming sell-through? Adam Norwitt : Yes. So, when you talk about industrial in certain of these geographies, I wouldn't necessarily say that the performance of our industrial business in this case was really geographically focused. I mean there was nothing really of note geographically in our performance. I think I mentioned that we saw a continued and relatively significant decline in our sales to oil and gas markets. That is not geographical; I mean there is oil and gas in business in Asia, in Europe and in North America. We also saw some declines in rail mass transit as well. I think rail mass transit -- maybe there was a little bit more of that decline in Asia, but not so material to the impact. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize the performance of our industrial business on a geographical basis. The strength that we saw in places like heavy equipment and instrumentation, again just on an organic basis, were not necessarily geographically focused either. I think those were in new areas where we have new technologies and in particular where we have seen just this increasing prevalence of adoption of new electronics onto industrial equipment. And that is something that we see in particular in the heavy equipment and the sort of agriculture and mining and those type of very harsh environment large equipment areas of the industrial market where there is, seems to be actually quite an acceleration of the adoption of electronics. As companies by to embed more functionality in their devices and in their equipment in order to compete in a marketplace which is maybe not so favorable. Mike Wood : And as a follow can you just speak to your capacity? You mentioned your M&A pipeline, but just in terms of the leverage which I roughly calculate around two times EBITDA after FCI would be closed. Do you feel at all constrained by additional deals this year or by an operational capacity? Craig Lampo : Sure. I will take that one. At the end of the quarter -- I mean the answer is no. At the end of the quarter the company has in excess of $2.1 billion of capacity between our cash and revolver availability. Not to mention certainly our strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate. As we previously disclosed, we have earmarked about $1.3 billion of that capacity for acquisitions of FCI, the majority of which will be funded with our international cash. And certainly while this is a somewhat bigger deal than we've done in the past, as Adam just mentioned, relative to the size of Amphenol, certainly it is not our large deal. And certainly is well within the company's capital leverage capacity given full and appropriate consideration to certainly the importance of our ratings. In the future we will certainly continue to have a thoughtful and balanced approach to deploying our capital and financial strength, giving appropriate consideration and priority of certainly first to our acquisition program and then to our dividend program and probably lastly, to our stock buyback program. So in the near-term, depending on future acquisition activity, including FCI, that weighting may be a little bit more skewed towards our acquisition program. But as a management team we believe this certainly provides the best long-term return to our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : And Craig, congrats on the official appointment, wanted to dig in a little bit more on just mobile infrastructure in terms of where you are seeing the incremental weakness by geography, if you could help us out with that. And the weakness that you are seeing in the back half, does that mean that you are seeing projects spill into 2016 or is this stuff just -- that is not going to be built out? Adam Norwitt : Yes, no. I think it is actually pretty interesting. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis in local currency, essentially all geographies are down by the same amount. And so, the amount by which we were down, that kind of 23% in local currency, that was spot on in each geography really kind of the same number. And while that is a coincidence of course, because there is not necessarily a correlation, I think it is indicative of one thing. And that is that you had a very significant build out cycle last year, no doubt about it. And there is always some digestion. But in addition to the digestion there is a little bit of what I would call indigestion that comes from a few [Technical Difficulty] happening. And one of those is just broadly in the carrier space there is a lot of activity, corporate activity, mergers, discussions, acquisitions, regulatory things that are happening. That is one. And then you see that is more in the West in North America in particular and then a little bit in Europe. But you have also in China some government-related actions that are happening that are also keeping a damper on the mobile infrastructure spending in the first half. I think as we look towards the second half we do anticipate the second half being stronger than the first half, just not at the level that we had originally come into the year talking about. I mean if you remember, Shawn, very well, last quarter we also had to adopt a bit more negative view of this market and we incrementally feel a little more negative this time. And that doesn't feel so great in that wireless infrastructure market. But it just appears that the spending is being extended a little bit and in the end the overall levels for the full year will be less. Does that mean that it that is kind of permanently lost? I don't think so whatsoever. At the end of the day the data rates, the consumption, the expansion of devices is still going unabated. I saw just a statistic which I am sure many of you saw this week, I mean overall mobile data usage up 51% year over year in the second quarter and on a global basis. I mean those are numbers that have tremendous ultimate impact on the requirements to invest in next-generation networks. And we see still an amazing amount of activity around designing the next generation. You talk about 3G, then to 4G, LTE, then to 5G. I am sure one day we're all going to be sitting around here and I'll have a full head of gray hair and we will be talking about 10G. But there is just this sort of immutable march forward in the demands of mobile data that ultimately does drive the investment cycle. And as I have said for years past, it goes in these cycles. We never relax our efforts to gain strong position across a wide array of OEMs and service providers because we know that ultimately that pent-up demand has to get satisfied. We saw that last year and we're very confident that over the coming years we will continue to see strong needs of capital investments and equipment upgrades and technology advances in the wireless infrastructure market. Shawn Harrison : And just as a follow-up on FCI, I guess one of the concerns I have received is that, FCI being owned by private equity for a number of years now, almost 10, maybe Bain has squeezed a lot of blood from the stone. How do you generate the margins and push margins higher in that business? Is it revenue synergies? Is it ways to sprinkle -- I don't know if this is the best term -- the Amphenol dust on the business and bring it into the fold and there is opportunities there? Is there something else? Because I guess the general concern is that Bain was running it pretty lean. What opportunities does Amphenol have to improve the cost structure and margin profile? Adam Norwitt : Sure, it is an excellent question. And it is true, Bain owned it for nine years and I think by owning it for so long, by the way, we're not able to kind of starve the business either. They had to and they did continue to invest very strongly in the business over many years. As we look towards the operating improvements, I think you mentioned a number of things and I am not going to claim that we have pixie dust at Amphenol. But we certainly have an approach in the company towards expansion of operating profitability and really alignment of accountabilities such that you achieve that operating profitability. And that is something that we will work very hard with the FCI team, who is very excited, by the way, to be a part of that entrepreneurial culture. And we think that in and of itself has tremendous impacts on the profitability of the company. That was something we saw at the time with TCS that is something that we have seen with the GE sensors business. I mean time and again when you bring a company in that has come maybe from a slightly different approach and you bring them into that decentralized, accountable model of Amphenol you have really some fabulous impact that comes from that. Obviously from a revenue and a technology, I mean there are a lot of great, great opportunities to leverage the unique technologies that each of us have where collectively we can create better solutions for our customer either better cost solutions or better technology solutions. I mean FCI has just certain really fantastic innovations across the company where we will seek to apply some of those innovations more broadly across Amphenol and vice versa. And I think that that can also have a great impact on the overall operating results of the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Adam, I was hoping you could help us think through the guidance. It looks like you took the full-year guidance up at the low end but kept the high end the same. But the third quarter numbers look better than most people's expectations. So that implies that the fourth quarter was a bit lower than people's expectations. It seems to me that that is probably related to the seasonality of the mobile devices segment this quarter. But was hoping you could give us some thoughts on that seasonality this year and the fact that the guidance didn't really change that much. Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, I think you have answered your own question, Sherri, as far as I am concerned. As usual, you do the analysis perfectly. It is very true that we have raised -- we never gave third-quarter guidance, first of all. So I think we have always given full-year guidance and we're very happy to be able to sustain that full-year guidance. I think we feel that the third quarter is strong in mobile and I think I already mentioned that we would anticipate in the December quarter to see a little bit of a sequential moderation in our sales into the mobile devices market. I think relative to that full-year guidance we have obviously the benefit of the two acquisitions. And I mentioned as well that from an organic standpoint we see our range at really a 3% to 4% organic growth range. And that is a slight tick down from what we had seen before all for the reasons that I discussed in the various markets and in particular across the carrier market. So, I think that the uncertainty in particular in those carrier-based markets, the mobile infrastructure and broadband markets, with all that is going on in that space that injects maybe a little bit more dose of conservatism into our outlook. But net-net we're extremely pleased to have that guidance really holding at the high end, bringing that up at the low end and with a real strong sense of confidence given a market environment that we think has incrementally gotten a little bit more challenging throughout the course of the quarter. Sherri Scribner : And it actually feeds into my follow-up which was in the press release you noted an increased level of uncertainty globally. In answer now you just suggested maybe that is just related to the carrier segment. But wanted to get a sense of where you are seeing the uncertainty. Is it generally pretty broad, is it some segments like carrier or is it some other segments too? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : No, I think when I talked about the carrier, that is really the specific impact to our outlook. I think the general comment about uncertainty in the marketplace is really more of a general one. As I mentioned I think early on, just as the quarter went on it was a little bit more of a fight to get the orders. I think our team is really up to the task and they did a fantastic job given that environment and we're confident that we will continue to do an excellent job given that environment going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Congratulations on the good outlook relative to what we're seeing elsewhere. And that is really what I would like to focus on. One of the areas that some other component and semiconductor companies have talked about is channel inventory adjustments denting their Q3 outlooks. I am wondering if you are saying anything in this regard, if you are seeing any actions by either end customers or the channel in reducing inventory? Adam Norwitt : Yes, look, in the channel as it is distribution, distribution represents under 13% of our sales in the quarter. And I don't know that we have seen anything really marked in terms of massive inventory reduction or changes. I wouldn't say that the distribution channel has been very frothy in the quarter. And when we talk about it being a little bit more of a fight, maybe there is some component of that that is related to distribution. But again, it hasn't been that there was like a pivot in the behavior of our distributors or in the behavior of the sell-through with our distributors. I think that it is just a little bit more sometimes of a challenge and maybe a little bit more of a conservatism on their part, but we don't see big inventory reductions, pullbacks, massive corrections coming out of that channel right now. William Stein : And one follow-up if I can, I'm wondering if you might give us an update on the progress of the sensor business? You have done a couple of acquisitions there in the last year or two. And I know that you highlighted some design wins in particular in automotive I think. Maybe you could just kind of give us an update on how that part of the business is progressing? Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, look, we continue to be really excited about our sensor business. It is coming up, believe it or not, on a year and a half. We passed the year and a half mark of owning the GE sensors business; end of this year it will already be two years. Time flies. And Casco was acquired nearly a year ago. And I would just reiterate, as I have said on the last several calls, that we feel really excited about that. And we continue to get great affirmation from customers that us owning a sensor business is a really good thing for the company, a good thing for our customers and a good thing for the technology solutions that we can provide. We're working very hard on a very collaborative basis across the company to uncover and to pursue opportunities where we can really bring in a sensor and an interconnect together with maybe our industrial business or our automotive business. And I would say that we have had good wins in that area. I wouldn't point to anything that is really material to the outlook of the company as yet, but I think the long-term prognosis for our sensor business is excellent as is the long-term prognosis for the opportunity of having that sensor and interconnect solution. The ability to package the sensor together with a harsh environment or otherwise interconnect solution is something that is very special. And it is something that our customers appear to have a great desire to engage with us on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : I guess it is not pixie dust, maybe the word is Amphenolian. But just on the automotive business, that has come quite a far way in the last couple years through a mix of the organic as well as acquisitions. Can you talk about where you are from a penetration standpoint and how much you have to gain from that versus just the overriding increasing content theme? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean, look, we're still small on a relative basis compared to some of the major participants in the space. But we're a little bit less small than we were five years ago, that is -- there is no doubt about it. And we have made outstanding acquisitions over those five, six years and we have continued to do that here in the quarter -- at the end of the second quarter with DoCharm. And I think when I look at that business today and I compare that business to circa 2009, a couple of things. Number one is a much broader offering of products across a broader range of applications. That is number one. Number two is we now have kind of at a minimum a foot in the door, sometimes a leg and sometimes even the whole body, but at a minimum a foot in the door with the vast majority of major automotive OEMs in most geographies. I think with the exception of Japan where we have never had a strong position. And I wouldn't say that we have necessarily gained that strong position even if, with some of the Japanese OEMs outside of Japan, we have actually gained a strong position. And then the third is just regionally. Where our automotive business would have been six years ago two-thirds or three-quarters European, today that automotive business is actually quite balanced on a regional basis. Europe is still marginally the largest territory. But really it is marginal as compared to North America and Asia. And with the acquisition that we've just made, that will bring even a stronger position with us in China both with the international as well as the indigenous participants in China. And look we certainly read the papers and hear everybody talking about is there a downturn in China and all of this. I mean the reality is we have still such a small position and still so much to gain across the range of electronics in those cars that we still feel a great sense of confidence in our automotive business. And I think ultimately that has translated into the strong performance we had this quarter, 16% organic growth in the quarter and our continued outlook where we anticipate still for the year to have kind of mid-teens organic growth in the automotive market. And that is clearly not reflective of just rising with the tide in overall unit sales. So there is a lot of gaining of position on new applications with new products from us that is really driving that growth. Craig Hettenbach : Just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned just some of the change occurring in the data center. That has been another area of potential concern in terms of is there any slowing on the hyper scale side. Any insight in terms of kind of what you are seeing from data center growth into the back half? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I think I did talk about the fact that we had a good quarter in IT datacom compared to the overall market. We still anticipate kind of a mid-single-digit growth in the IT datacom market for the year. There is no question, this transformation that is happening in the IT datacom market, the real shifting of the balance of power from traditional OEMs building boxes and putting them in boxes and shipping them to this more sort of Web 2.0, cloud web service, I mean there is so many different names you can call it. That transformation continues unabated. And I think that shifting of the balance of power is a very dangerous time in the market for someone who is caught unawares. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job and we've made a lot of real significant organizational moves, let me say. Taking people who were really strong people focused on certain areas and saying, I am cutting the cord with you there and putting you into something totally new. It is hard for them because now they have got to go from wearing a tie to wearing shorts and Birkenstocks when they go to the customers. But ultimately that transformation of our people and then the tailoring of the technologies to what the needs of the web service company that is something that we think is going to bear fruit long-term. You've got to chase where the money is in a space like this and I think that we have done so far a great job of that. But it is not a space without its peril when you see the dramatic change that is happening in that area. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : And to make up for my lack of smartness I will just ask one question with no follow-ups. Can you just help us understand, FCI has been around for a very long time with a long history, although the company has gone through a lot of international restructuring challenges and you announced that you are acquiring FCI Asia. Can you help us better understand what does that all include? Geographic reach? A lot of their businesses over the past decade or 15 years have kind of been divested or slowed or closed down or things like that. Are you acquiring all that is left in FCI? And if so is there still much heavy lifting to do to get it integrated? Or in the past their cost structure has been very French and Spanish and kind of Western Europe high cost basis. If you'd just help us understand kind of what you are all buying here and what type of effort it is going to take. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Jim, actually this was much more than one question, so you are still very smart. Let me just clarify relative to FCI Asia, as it is called, that is the legal name of the company. FCI is a global company, it happens to be headquartered in Singapore. It has a long history and it was originally, well let me say on an interim basis it was a French company. Long ago [indiscernible] Electronics which is one of the predecessor companies, was certainly an American company. But FCI as a global business is really around the world. They moved the headquarters to Asia a couple of years ago. It is true that FCI used to have several other businesses which over a certain number of years Bain took the approach to divest them kind of one by one. They had in automotive business, I'm sure everybody is familiar with that. They had a power business, a real high-voltage business that was divested a number of years back. They had also this what was called microelectronics business which was a very specialized business that was also divested. And we're buying really the totality of what Bain owns today which was originally known as FCI Electronics which was the commercial electronics interconnect business of FCI and that was always the piece of FCI that we had our eye on for this nearly a decade. And in terms of the heavy lifting that has been done, I mean the company has a great performance and it has performed better than maybe it did in the past. But we still see excellent opportunities in the future to improve operating performance of the business. And I think I already discussed a number of the different levers that we intend to exercise as we look towards improving the performance of FCI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Just a couple quick ones around some of the comments you made, Adam, on acquisitions. On the two acquisitions announced today I was wondering if you could just provide a couple of examples around where some of the European deals you said they have, RF interconnect exposure into the industrial markets. Can you give us some examples of that? And similarly, for the Chinese business, where you said automotive lighting that complements some other deals you have done, can you just give us a couple of examples of that? And then I had a quick follow up. Adam Norwitt : So first with ProCom, ProCom is actually an antenna company. Sorry if I misspoke. It expands our RF interconnect and antenna offering, but it is really a focused antenna company in the industrial market and really predominantly in the industrial market. It is a very special business in that they make antennas get used in very harsh environments. I mean take for example on a freighter ship where you have very complex wireless communications that have to happen on a freighter in the middle of the ocean. They would make those type of antennas. They make antennas that are used in emergency radio systems for police and fire departments. They make -- just a real wide variety of antennas that are used across a range of applications where we today don't participate. And that is what is so exciting about ProCom. It is obviously a small company, just over $20 million in sales. But it is a company with a unique technology, then we would look to expand their presence to other geographies where today they are a very European focused company. And together with our strong presence on industrial interconnect and with industrial customers we see here a great opportunity to leverage that antenna business into a new market area beyond just the wireless communications of mobile devices and mobile infrastructure where today we have a very strong position. Relative to DoCharm, I did mention that DoCharm has -- one of their main specialties is around complex interconnect assemblies that go into automotive lighting applications. You may recall that a number of years ago we acquired a company called [indiscernible] was really one of the leaders in automotive lighting in Europe and North America and that business has just done fantastic with us since we acquired it. What we really like about that business is twofold. One is in the lighting, that tends to be a very important application; lights have to work in a car. And it also tends to be a little bit more of a harsher environment part of the car because it tends to be a little bit closer to the air and rain and moisture. And so it allows you to really embed certain technology into that product for a product that really has to work. It has a safety element to it in addition and it has to work in a slightly tougher environment. And in addition, it is an area where lighting tends to change at a somewhat different and faster cadence than overall model changes. You have what are called in cars facelifts now and those facelifts are sort of mid platform changes in the car where they don't change the drive train, they don't change the underlying architecture of the car, but they do things to the car to make it look a little better, to upgrade a little bit the electronics. And those facelifts and mid-cycle upgrades have started to become a real positive aspect of the automotive market whereby you used to really -- if you didn't get on something you had to wait three to five years to get onto the next one. Today with that mid-cycle upgrade and those facelifts, it allows you to have a little bit different velocity to winning business. And that is something that we really like about this lighting business. I think the last thing I would say about DoCharm is, because it is a real indigenous Chinese company founded by a fabulous entrepreneur, [Technical Difficulty] very successful in his space, it gives us a different level of position in the Chinese indigenous market. And we're very happy that the entire management team is very committed to staying with Amphenol. And they have great role models of companies in China who have been acquired by Amphenol, but whereby the owner has stayed with the company for many, many years. We have one where the owner has been with us still for 12 years after the fact. And I think that the continuity of the management, together with the strength of presence with the local customers, is something that has a lot of value. Steven Fox : And then just really quickly, during your prepared remarks you mentioned that Goldstar and Casco were helping organic growth. And I was just wondering if you can clarify whether that was sales synergies with existing businesses or bringing their business into your customers? Or were you just referring to their own growth on a standalone basis? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes, sorry, again if I misspoke, Steve, I apologize. But I did not mean that they were helping our organic growth, I meant that our overall growth was aided by the additions of Goldstar and Casco. Operator : Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, relative to most of your recent acquisitions, FCI appears to be very different in that you need to do a lot more heavy lifting with integrations, whereas in many of your other acquisitions you tended to acquire entities that just leveraged your scale, reach and technology, but you don't have to sort of do much in terms of integration. So two questions, one, what are you expecting in terms of integration cost for this acquisition? Will you be including that in your non-GAAP earnings as you refer to accretion? And secondly, should we expect to see more acquisitions from Amphenol given the relative size that you are now as a company that you would need to go after targets where you would have to on an ongoing basis be more involved in integration? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : I think it is true that FCI is a larger company and that it has maybe some work to be done as it joins with Amphenol in terms of aligning it appropriately in the business. But let's not forget that the core thing that we look to do in companies like that is to just instill the culture of Amphenol. I think we talked about at the time when we acquired GE sensors that that was a very different culture, it was a very different organization. And there was maybe a little bit more work that we had to do in that case to align the company towards and Amphenol like measure of accountability and operating discipline and really to bring that sort of cultural change into the company. And that comes down to essentially making sure that you have got direct line management, general managers who run businesses to which they are held accountable and for which they have authority. And I think that is the main thing that we would make sure is the case here with FCI. I think we have really the -- all wherewithal to make sure that that is the case. We have a great playbook to apply. And ultimately it doesn't mean that we're going in and monkeying around with the whole thing, but rather we're making sure that there are the appropriate accountabilities for the focus businesses within FCI. By the way, that is something that the current and soon-to-be prior owners were already heading towards with FCI. As they migrated the business as they drove that towards more accountability, they were in many respects looking to emulate Amphenol already. And so, I think we can just accelerate that emulation a little bit as it joins with us. And maybe I'll let Craig comment a little bit on just how we would view costs related to the acquisition. Craig Lampo : Sure. I mean we would expect some similar charges to those we've had in the past for things like transaction-related fees, expenses and purchase accounting-related items like inventory and backlog valuations that would be amortized early in the first year and these items certainly would be one-time in nature and we would call these out. In addition, certainly given the size of the deal, it is possible that there could be some other nonrecurring charges. If so we would certainly call them out. Operator : At this point we don't have any more questions over the phone. Adam Norwitt : That is very good. Well, thank you again, everybody for your attention today. I know it is a busy day for all of you and we truly appreciate your time and I hope it is not too late to wish you all a very enjoyable and pleasant summer. Hopefully you will get, after this busy earning season a little bit of time to have some vacation with your families. Thanks again and we will talk to you all in about 90 days.

Adam Norwitt - President and CEO Analysts : Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets William Stein - SunTrust Mike Wood - Macquarie Securities Matt Sheerin - Stifel Nicolaus Jim Suva - Citi Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Shawn Harrison - Longbow Research Steven Fox - Cross Research Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Operator : Hello and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig A. Lampo: Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with our CEO, Adam Norwitt. We'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then Q&A. The Company closed the third quarter with record sales and EPS of $1.460 billion and $0.65. Sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter were up 5%. Sequentially sales were up 8% in both U.S. dollars and organically from the second quarter. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 10% from last quarter primarily due to a slowdown in spending by cable operators as well as the effective currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 9% from last year reflecting the benefits of good organic growth and the Company's acquisition program, partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income increased to $295 million in the third quarter. Operating margin increased to a very strong 20.2% compared to 19.9%, excluding one-time items, in the third quarter of last year. This was a year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of 24%. The increase of 30 basis points in operating margins over the prior year primarily resulted from an increase in operating margins in the Interconnect business. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.5%, which is equal to last year. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 22.3%, up 20 basis points from 22.1% last year. The improvement in ROS reflects excellent operating execution, both organically and from our acquisitions in addition to aggressive cost management. We are very pleased with the Company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a market environment which certainly became more challenging as the quarter progressed. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $21 million last year, reflecting the benefit of the lower average effective interest rate in the quarter and more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the Company's acquisition and buyback programs. The lower average rate is a result of the note issuance in September 2014, replacing a higher cost note maturity in November of last year, and the implementation of the new commercial paper program. Other income was $4 million in the third quarter compared to $5 million last year, and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short term cash investments. The Company's effective tax rate excluding one-time items was 26.5% in both the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014. On an as-reported basis, the Company's effective tax rate was 26.8% in the third quarter of last year. Net income was approximately 14% of sales in the third quarter of the year, and EPS increased 12% excluding one-time items, which is an excellent performance. Orders for the quarter were 1.44 billion, up 8% from last year, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 0.99-to-1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $285 million in the third quarter or approximately 140% of net income. The Company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income and for the nine months ended September 30 operating cash flow was $708 million or 124% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $888 million at the end of the quarter, approximately equal to June. Inventory days were 80, excluding acquisition impacts, which is down seven days from June levels, as expected. Accounts receivable was approximately at $1.2 billion at the end of September, up approximately 7% from June. And day sales outstanding were 71 days, excluding acquisition impacts, which is down one day from June levels. Finally, accounts payable were $661 million at the end of the quarter, up approximately 18% from June levels. Payable days were 60 days, up five days compared to June levels. The cash flow from operations of $285 million along with proceeds from the commercial paper program of $94 million and proceeds from stock option exercises of $6 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $52 million of the Company's stock to fund net capital expenditures of $41 million, to fund final payments of $28 million related to previous 2015 acquisitions and to fund dividend payments of $39 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $200 million, net of translation. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 6.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.6 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S., and total debt at September 30 was $2.9 billion and net debt was approximately $1.3 billion. At quarter end, the Company had issued $852 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program. In the third quarter, EBITDA was approximately $350 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to the assumption that we have included in our guidance. The midpoint of sales guidance for the year has been revised from $5.580 billion to $5.488 billion, a reduction of $92 million or 2%. About half of this reduction is due to the weakness in the global industrial market. The remainder relates to moderation in demand in automotive and IT datacom market. We believe this weaker demand is the result of a higher level of uncertainty in global markets as growing turbulence in certain economies has impacted global industrial demand. This has resulted in increased levels of caution from customers in several of our end markets and has translated into lower demand expectation. Our fourth quarter guidance of $1.330 billion to $1.370 billion in sales or a 6% to 9% sequential decline reflects the impact of these items. I would also like to note that the majority of the sequential decline in the fourth quarter is driven by the 20% plus sequential reduction in sales in the mobile devices market due to program timing. This is consistent with our previous expectation and results in an annual growth rate in the high single digits in the mobile devices market. Given our current expectation of the fourth quarter sales levels, we are taking appropriate actions to adjust our cost structure. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. R. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also offer my welcome to all of you on the phone with us here today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to discuss some trends in the progress across our served markets. I'll also highlight some of our third quarter achievements. And then finally I'll spend some time to comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2015, and certainly we'll have time for questions at the end. With respect to the third quarter, I'm just so pleased that we're able to report record results here in the third quarter despite an economic environment that has recently grown even more challenging. We achieved record sales of $1.460 billion, which was an increase of a very strong 7% from prior year in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies. We booked record orders of $1.444 billion with a book-to-bill of just under 1-to-1. And very importantly, we equalled in the quarter our highest levels of profitability that we have ever achieved as we reached an industry leading operating margin of 20.2%. Our record EPS in the quarter of $0.65 grew a very strong 12% also from prior year. I think Craig elaborated on our cash flow and we're very proud to have generated $285 million of cash in the quarter. I think that cash flow is just a great reflection of the discipline and focus of the entire Amphenol management team. Indeed in this current highly uncertain environment, our organization did just a really outstanding job in the quarter of maximizing performance in the face of substantial challenges that have emerged in the global economy. This is yet another confirmation of the strength of the Company's agile entrepreneurial culture. Turning to the trends in our served markets, I just wanted to say that we continue to be very focused on driving end market diversification across the Company and once again that strategy has supported the Company's strong performance here in the third quarter. Turning first to the military market, that market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased from prior year by 3% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currencies as distributors' buying patterns became more conservative and as reductions in both communications and avionics applications were not fully offset by growth that we saw in ordnance, engines and rotorcraft. Sequentially, sales in military were a bit softer than we had expected falling by 2%. As we now look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels and we essentially expect the military market to be flat to prior year for the full year 2015. Amidst the current moderate spending environment, we remain very confident that our broad technology position and expansive participation across a wide array of military programs positions us very well to capitalize on any spending that gets ultimately triggered. In the context of the modern complex geopolitical environment, military electronics continues to be an enabler for government who are seeking to ensure their own security. As adoption of electronics grows across a broad range of military technologies and as spending increases in geographies around the world, Amphenol remains extremely well-positioned for the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were down 10% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. We experienced in the quarter a moderation of demand, in particular related to business jets and commercial helicopters, as well as some reduced demand related to some avionics subsystems combined with a little bit of conservatism in the distribution channel related to that. Sequentially, sales decreased by greater than seasonally expected 10% for those same reasons. While we expect the normalization of demand from both our OEM and distributor customers in the fourth quarter, and thus anticipate a double-digit sequential sales increase from these levels in the fourth quarter, we now expect our sales into this market to essentially be flat in local currency for the full year. Regardless of that flat outlook, we continue to have an outstanding design and position on the newest commercial aircraft with a broad array of connectors, value-add cable and printed circuit assemblies as well as cable management products. This strong and comprehensive product position creates a great long-term expansion opportunity for Amphenol. Industrial market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales fell slightly in U.S. dollars and were up slightly in local currencies. While our sales grew robustly in heavy equipment and alternative energy, that growth was offset by significant declines in oil and gas as well as more moderate reductions in several other segments of the industrial market. Sequentially, our sales fell by 3% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we have recently seen some more significant reductions in demand expectations of many customers in the industrial market and this appears to in particular result from turbulence in certain emerging economies together with the collective impact of the downturn in commodity prices. Accordingly, we now expect sales in the industrial market to remain at these lower levels going into the fourth quarter. Regardless of this near-term moderation of our outlook, Amphenol's position across the many segments in the industrial market remains extremely strong and our team looks forward to leveraging our wide array of advanced technology interconnect, sensor and antenna products to drive strong performance in the future in the very diversified industrial market. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales once again increased very strongly from prior year growing 29% in U.S. dollars, 39% in local currency and 13% organically, an excellent performance by any measure. That continued performance in this important market resulted from ongoing momentum of our sales of an ever-growing array of interconnect and sensor products used in automotive electronics, together with the contributions from the Casco and DoCharm acquisitions that we have completed over the last year. Sequentially sales were up just slightly from the second quarter. While we continue to be very pleased to be out-growing the overall automotive market, we have recently begun to see signs from certain tier customers of a moderation of demand expectations, in particular in China. Accordingly, we now expect a slight reduction of sales in the fourth quarter from current levels. Normally we would see a slight seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we retain a very positive long-term view of the automotive market as our broadened product offering of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions us to capitalize on the continued expansion of automotive electronics for many years to come. I think very importantly, we now have really expanded our reach into and our position with automotive customers around the world, essentially in all geographies. The mobile devices market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market increased by an extremely strong 40% from prior year and 51% sequentially, as we were able to capitalize on our expected higher levels of production supporting new programs. In particular, we experienced strong demand related to laptop, accessories and production related products in support of customer ramp-up. As we have previously discussed, we anticipate an approximately 20% reduction of sales sequentially into the fourth quarter as volumes are reduced from the peak demand levels that we experienced here in the third quarter. For the full year 2015, as Craig mentioned, we expect growth to be in the high single-digits. There is no question that the mobile devices market is among the most dynamic in which we participate. It is really a tremendous credit to our organization that they were able to flex their resources so quickly in reaction to accelerated customer demand and thereby to achieve this excellent performance here in the third quarter. Long-term, we remain confident that our leading technology, our preferred supplier relationships with a broad range of device makers and the excellent track record of execution of our outstanding agile organization positions us strongly for the future in this very exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and although sales declined by 24% from prior year and 19% in local currencies, we were pleased to see a 5% sequential sales growth in the third quarter and that was driven in particular by some increased demand in North America. Looking ahead, we don't expect any further increase of activity in base station buildout for the remainder of the year of 2015 and in fact expect our sales to be down slightly in the normally seasonally softer fourth quarter. This has no doubt been a challenging year in the mobile networks market as operators in many regions have deferred their investment plans as a result of a wide array of external factors. Nevertheless, I think we all know that the ongoing demand by consumers for expanded coverage and capacity continues to grow significantly. So given our strong position in the mobile networks market, we remain very confident that with our industry-leading breadth of interconnect and antenna products, we will continue to participate broadly in next generation mobile network deployments as they are triggered around the world. The information technology and datacom market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by roughly 3% from prior year and 2% sequentially as stronger sales in server related products were partially offset by reductions in demand that we saw from networking and in particular storage customers. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, customer forecasts have recently reflected some degree of weakening demand, in particular for products used in storage and somewhat for servers. Accordingly, we now expect our sales to the IT datacom market to reduce somewhat from these levels in the fourth quarter, which normally would be seasonally stronger. Regardless of this near-term moderation of demand, our position in the IT datacom market remains extremely strong. We continue to make outstanding progress designing in our advanced high-speed and power products into next-generation equipment, and at the same time we are accelerating our penetration of cloud and Web service providers who are rapidly expanding their influence in the IT hardware industry, and we look forward to gaining further momentum in this market long-term. Finally the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were a bit less robust than expected as cable and satellite operators continue to constrain their spending levels with our sales falling about 6% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. Sales were up slightly on a sequential basis from the second quarter. We expect sales to remain at or slightly below these levels in what is normally a seasonally slower fourth quarter and we continue to see that many multiservice operators, satellite and telco customers remain conservative in their spending on network upgrades, in particular given the several high-profile industry mergers which either have recently been completed or still pending, together with the significant currency devaluations that we've seen in certain emerging markets, in particular in Latin America, and those devaluations are also constraining spending. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will realize long-term success in this market, primarily due to our proven capability to create innovative solutions for our customers in support of the rapid growth of high-speed data delivery. As we drive further efforts to create these enabling technologies, we look forward to maintaining our leading position in the broadband market. So just a final word here on the third quarter, I just want to say I'm extremely proud of our organization as we once again executed very well in the third quarter despite a heightened level of economic uncertainty and a very dynamic market environment. Our continued strong performance here in 2015 is a clear reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence and a lean and flexible cost structure. Above all these strengths though, our greatest asset remains Amphenol's agile entrepreneurial management team who reinforces that high-performance culture every day and in particular who excels in times where markets are more uncertain. Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2015, as Craig and I have already mentioned, we have recently seen increased signs that turbulence in certain economies have begun to impact the outlook for global industrial production, and that has resulted in a moderation of our sales expectations in particular in the industrial, automotive and IT datacom market. Based on these conditions and assuming that exchange rates remain stable at current levels, we now expect in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $1.330 billion to $1.370 billion and EPS in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 respectively. This represents a sales reduction from prior year for the fourth quarter of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% to 4% in local currency and an EPS reduction of 5% to 8%. For the full-year 2015, we now expect sales in the range of $5.468 billion to $5.508 billion, an increase of 2% to 3% in U.S. dollars, 6% to 7% in local currencies and 1% to 2% organically, and we expect EPS for the year of $2.38 to $2.40, an increase of 6% to 7% over 2014 excluding one-time items. As Craig alluded to, our team is of course reacting very quickly to adjust resources in the face of this reduction in our outlook for the fourth quarter. We remain singularly focused as an organization on reacting quickly to changes in the market environment while continuing to pursue the many opportunities for expansion that are still present in the global electronics industry. In fact, it is really in challenging times like these that the unique agility and drive of the Amphenol management team is most important, and with that I remain extremely confident in the ability of that outstanding team to continue to capitalize on opportunities to grow our market position and achieve superior profitability and thereby to drive continued strong performance for the Company through the remainder of 2015 and beyond. With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question came from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Two questions from me. One, I guess Adam, could you just talk a little bit more on the industrial markets in terms of when did you start to see the softness in the quarter, and when I think about the guide, Adam, it's sort of flat sequentially in December quarter, that doesn't seem overly conservative in my head, so maybe talk about the comfort level you have that things don't get worse from what you saw in September within that industrial bucket? R. Adam Norwitt : I think with respect to the industrial market, I think what we certainly saw is really more recently towards the end of the quarter and even coming here into October is when we started to see some expectations from customers being revised downward. I think that we continue to have an outlook in the industrial market that is kind of flat but we used to have an outlook that is going up in the quarter, and that's why the change in our guidance. We had a lot of expectations from customers of actual growth going into the end of the year which now we don't see happening. In terms of the conservatism of that, I think we have taken due prudence in looking at the expectations from our customers and we feel confident in the number that we have now given, otherwise we wouldn't be giving them obviously, but I think that we continue to perform in the industrial market very well. Last quarter we continued to really expand our market position but not at the levels that we would've thought coming into the quarter. Amit Daryanani : That's helpful. And then I guess just in the mobile devices side, you did somewhat better than you guys thought obviously in the September quarter, and it's going to be down 20 in December, I'm just curious, how do you think of seasonality as you get into the March quarter? I don't want to get too far ahead but is that essentially you're pulling your seasonal so March should not be down as severely anymore, how to just think of that segment, and then did you have a 10% customer this quarter? R. Adam Norwitt : I think just with respect to the third quarter, the trajectory that we saw in the market was maybe a little bit better in the third quarter than we thought but in general the trajectory that we're seeing here in the second half is what we have expected to see. I think it's still premature to talk about what we would see in the first quarter and I think it's still premature to talk about the nature of which customers we have at what percentage at this time. I think the reaction of our team here in the third quarter is something that I think is just so important to emphasize. When we see that we were able to grow the sales by the amount that we were able to grow, and you can imagine on the flipside going down by 20% here in the fourth quarter, you remember last year or this year in the first quarter our sales were down by 30%, I think it is just a really great testament to the organization that they were able to capitalize on the upside that we knew was coming in this case and adjust to the variations in that market going into the fourth quarter, and whatever the first quarter will bring, no doubt about it the team will maximize performance and also ensure a secure bottom line going into the first quarter. Operator : The next question came from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Adam, I just want to synthesize some of your comments and relative to the last question, when you say that, I forgot exactly what the wording of the press release and the comments were, but I want to distinguish bookings from billings, am I correct in looking at or reading everything that we've read and listening to the call that it's bookings that sound like they eroded more in the September month and into October as well, is that sort of the linearity we should think about for bookings? R. Adam Norwitt : I think it is a little tricky to look at bookings and how do bookings reflect on the subsequent quarter, in particular when you have such a strong mobile quarter. As you may recall, our mobile business essentially books as it ships. So it's not a book to ship kind of a business, and so in a quarter like the third quarter where we did have a very strong sequential growth in our sales for mobile, the bookings in fact followed and we had a book to bill in the quarter of just under 1-to-1. What I would say is that as we went through the quarter, that 1-to-1 got a little bit less into September and into the expectations that we saw here in October. And so I think from that standpoint, the trajectory during the quarter clearly at the end of the quarter, that 1-to-1 ratio eroded somewhat and that was one of the signals of the expectations of demand from the customers going to the fourth quarter. William Stein : That's very helpful color, Adam. And then maybe one more on the automotive end market, we've seen some weakening data from China in the earlier part of Q3 but much more recent data has been more positive in response to a stimulus presumably in China, and I'm wondering is this lag that we're seeing, what looks like a lag in your business where you had strong Q3, Q4 outlook is weaker, do we take that as just a normal lag through the typical direct supply chain or is this a lag because of distribution or is there some other explanation, and thanks very much? R. Adam Norwitt : I think that as you termed it, weakening from China, I've said before even if our business in China has grown significantly from where it was, in Asia has grown significantly from where it was before, we're still not a great bellwether for what is happening in China. I think that we have started to see, as the quarter drew on, some pullback in demand from customers in Asia and in China specifically. Is there a lag due to normal direct supplier versus distribution, what I can say is we don't do a lot of sales through distribution in the automotive market globally and that includes also in China. What is the kind of lag through the various tiers because we're not selling in general directly to automotive OEMs, you can imagine that there could be some lag there. I don't know, there has been a lot of talk of the recent stimulus in China and the reduction of VAT taxes on certain things and what does that translate into, what types of cars, what types of OEMs are benefiting from that, I mean that can all have some impact. Then I think again our position is not as broad as to say that we're a perfect reflection of what's happening in China. What we see from our customers just of late has been some reduction in the expectations that we would've had. Traditionally the Chinese market, and we're just getting to know the Chinese automotive market a little bit, it tends to be more of a second half loaded market than does the rest of the worldwide automotive market which tends to be more of a first half loaded market, and I think that where you normally would have seen a buildup towards that higher levels demand, I think maybe you see a little bit less of a buildup towards those higher levels of demand even if the demand is not necessarily falling off but it may only be a kind of a flat end demand. That's one theory that one could ascribe to that, but again we are not a great representation of the totality of the Chinese automotive market. Operator : The next question came from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Security Group. Your line is now open. Mike Wood : First question just on auto segment, relatively a slight decline seen in global auto production over the past few months, and it looks like you're pointing to a low single digit growth ramp on that segment in the fourth quarter, at a much narrower content expansion than we've seen in the past. Curious if there's something in there that's kind of making it look smaller than you've typically seen or is this just what may be now normal from a content expansion in that segment? R. Adam Norwitt : I think what's implicit in our guidance for the fourth quarter is kind of a high single-digit local currency expansion of our prior year. I think we just had a fabulous quarter in automotive, 13% organic growth, 39% in local currency in the third quarter, and I think we continue to outperform the overall automotive market and we continue to have a conviction that we will continue to outperform the automotive market overall. What is growth in units versus what is growth in content versus what is growth in Amphenol, I think that will remain to be seen in the coming year and years to come but our position continues to expand, we continue to leverage the acquisitions that we've made as well as the organic developments that we've made, and we certainly feel that our ability to expand and the room for us to continue to expand in that space is not limited at this stage. Mike Wood : Great. And as a follow-up, the resources just that you discussed in your prepared remarks, would that take time to fully be implemented, should we expect it in the first quarter to sort of all flow through in incremental margins? R. Adam Norwitt : I think that we always take very quickly action in Amphenol when we see demand changes, and I think for those who follow the Company for many cycles, you know that that doesn't take us to sit back and wait for kind of a news headline that says things are bad, we look case by case across our 90 operating units and as we see demand decline or demand expectations decline from customers, we take immediately action. And so there's not necessarily a lag from when we start to see it to when we start to take action. We take the action right away and we do that action in order to secure our conversion margins going into that time, and I think if you look at our guidance here in the fourth quarter, it's a very strong guidance from a bottom-line standpoint and I think that is reflective of our normal operating approach which is to take quick action in the moment as soon as we're seeing the problems from customers. Operator : The next question came from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : So just following up on that question, Adam, regarding your approach to taking cost at the operating level, obviously reacting to near term order trends, but as you look and obviously visibility into the Q1 is going to be tough here, it seems like we're seeing a bit of a pause from customers, and typically getting into the December quarter it's very backend \u2013 sorry, front-end loaded, so do you get a sense at all that this is a pause and you may start to see end markets like industrial and auto where you typically see things pickup in March, that you may get signs that we will see that following a pause or will you continue to take cost as though it's going to flat-line here and be weak for a while? R. Adam Norwitt : I think we don't bet on the future when we see this. I think that's just a hallmark of the Company. So we are not guessing where Q1 is going to go for example in the industrial or in the automotive markets. We're taking the action in what we see today and we do that in a very prudent but also a very aggressive fashion, and that's something that we do if we think that it's a one quarter or a two quarter or whether that is a significant downturn in the economy, we try not to differentiate because once you get into the business of making cost reductions by guessing where the future is going to be, you never make them in a timely fashion, and that has always been for us a principle that we follow regardless. Whether that's a one quarter, a one month, a two quarter or a one year, we believe in our Company that you got to take those actions quickly and then you get out in front of customers rapidly to make sure that you're driving incremental sales and expanding your market position. If you end up in a situation where that is a longer time period, you are ahead of the game and you're out there with customers already while your competitors are sitting in conference rooms trying to solve the restructuring that they are trying to do. That's just not how we approach these matters, and I think the fact that we do that with these 90 general managers around the world, it's not a big thing. We're not sitting here at headquarters saying, all right, what percent of headcount do we take out, we're talking 90 times to 90 GMs and several of those have some different expectations than they used to have, well, what are you doing about it? It's a very simple, straightforward thing. And most of the time we don't even have to ask, they've already done it and we just get to them and we have a confirmatory discussion that yes, we did what we needed to do and let's move on and get some orders. Matt Sheerin : Okay, that's helpful. And just regarding the mobility business, I get the guide after a very strong September quarter, but you understand that smartphones is a chunk of your revenue there but obviously you're doing wearables, notebooks, tablets, could you go through some of those sectors and talk about performance, how you're positioned there and how you're seeing demand trends? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Look, I think we have a very strong position across the mobile devices market and I pointed out that in this quarter we especially saw strength from a lot of next-generation laptop products which have become much more connected devices now. I think everybody is seeing that there was this kind of wave of tablets that came over the last three, four years and there seems to be now kind of a back to the future here on October 21 of 2015, back to the future to the laptop where the laptops are becoming more an integral device and I think we've spent a lot of time making sure that we're well positioned on these next-generation products. In addition, we've gotten a lot of progress on accessories and accessories everything from wearables to smart devices and there's a whole kind of range of things that you can't really put into a category anymore. And I think we talked last quarter about the fact that in addition to that we have worked with customers on \u2013 working with them in their production ramp-ups and helping them with products that can support their quick ramp-ups, and I think across the board we are working in every opportunity with customers in the mobile devices market and they really rest on kind of two pillars. One is that we continue to please our customers and not disappoint our customers from the standpoint of technology and we continue to exceed their expectations in terms of execution, and in that market that ability to execute time and time again when they need you is something that means they keep coming back for more regardless of what the product is, what the end product is, what our product is that we're selling, and that's something that we continue to emphasize strongly with our team and I think ultimately was one of the reasons we were able to perform so strongly here in the third quarter. Operator : The next question came from the line of Jim Suva of Citi, Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. Two questions, and I'll give them both kind of at the same time. First of all on the mobility side, and maybe my numbers and memory is a little inaccurate or old, I had thought that this quarter mobility was going to be up kind of close to say 40%-ish due to seasonal, and I think I heard you say maybe it was up 50%. So it sounds like was that stronger than what you thought, and then for the full year you had mentioned unchanged, does that mean kind of the decline for Q4, coming down a little bit bigger or does it take up the full year up a little bit more? Then my second question is, I believe Amphenol recognises sales on sale into the assembler, so a large OEM when they place orders, is it truly based upon your reduction in your forecast upon end market demand or is there inventory buffer that we can think about or is it like a multi-quarter adjustment, just trying to get a feel on this recent slowdown doesn't have a multi-quarter impact due to both the assembler as well as the end product? R. Adam Norwitt : I think with your first question with respect to mobile devices, we expected sales to be up sort of approximately 40 or a little bit more than 40 and they were a little bit better than that. I think you're correct in pointing that out. And maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit worse but it's not meaningful compared to what the other things that we talked about. I think that relative to your question about timing, we obviously recognize our sales when we sell them to the person who places the order to us, and the person who places the order to us is sometimes the OEM if they are building it and sometimes it's the contract manufacturer if they are building it. In many cases we deal with contract manufacturers in particular in the markets that are more related to information technology, communications market and whatnot. Is there an inventory buffer, is there an inventory correction? We don't have great visibility into the inventories of that supply chain. We have about 11% of our sales go through distribution in the quarter and I think there we have some degree of inventory visibility, but relative to our sales that go into contract manufacturers across the communications market, there I can't tell you that we have a good read on what their inventories are. We know only what you know through publicly available information, and is that representative of an inventory correction or an inventory buffer, I think it's hard for us to say at this point. Operator : The next question came from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : First question, any update on the timing expected for the FCI transaction? R. Adam Norwitt : No, I don't think we have any news to report on that. As we talked about last time, we would expect that the deal would close by the end of the year. We are still in the regulatory approval process and have regulatory approval processes essentially now in the hands of the China antitrust regulators. As I think all of you know, that is a real black box in China. We are doing everything that we can to expedite it but it is not something that is necessarily easy to predict. To the extent that there any news or update comes, we certainly would let everybody know. At this time, we don't have any reason to think that it's any different, although that it remains in that black box. Craig Hettenbach : All right, and then just a follow-up on M&A more broadly and just thinking through the pipeline, anything to be said in terms of periods of disruption like we're seeing now or when demand comes in, do you see there will be opportunities to be more opportunistic or how you're seeing the landscape for M&A as you go into 2016? R. Adam Norwitt : Look, we are very pleased with our M&A progress this year. We have closed three deals, we have announced the fourth, we continue to have a really great pipeline of acquisitions that we are pursuing and we continue to have great availability to pursue those acquisitions financially. Does one quarter of a little bit of economic uncertainty create a different dynamic in the market for acquisitions? I don't think so. I mean when we look back over time periods that were even more severe than this, 2009 or others, the fourth quarter of 2011, it's not that sellers miraculously stand up and say, I'll sell my company to you quicker or cheaper, that's just not the dynamic that we see. We deal with very patient sellers and we're a very patient buyer and we take a very long-term approach to these things, and so it's either corrections in the equity market or uncertainty in the overall economy, that doesn't tend to drive acquisition activity any differently for us. If you look over the years, we have had years which are very strong economic years where we have done lots of deals, we have had other years where we've done fewer deals and the same can be said of less strong economic years. So I would not anticipate that there will be any meaningful change to the dynamics, but what I would just emphasize again is we have a very strong pipeline and an outstanding track record here of being the acquirer of choice in this industry, and as we look out over the interconnect and now the center industry for acquisition opportunities, we remain very confident that we will find more acquisitions for the long-term. And I think I would just add here, acquisition for the Company is a real organic capacity that we have. There's some years where our acquisitions will be at about that target that we have of generating about a third of our sales growth and there are other years where it can be more or less. I think what you see this year with our current guidance that at the high end of guidance or at the midpoint we'd be somewhere 6%, 7% growth in local currencies and acquisitions would make up a little bit more than half of that in this year. We've had other years where they've made up a little bit less than that. But I think overall it's the combination of the organic growth that we achieved together with the acquisition growth that ultimately creates great value for the Company and allows us to continue to expand our position with customers across the many markets that we serve. Operator : The next question came from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Adam, I just wanted to ask on the fourth quarter, your commentary on the different sections almost seem to suggest that we're seeing moderation and caution almost across the board throughout most of your segments. I think in all of the commentary for 4Q you've guided to relatively flattish or slightly down, obviously with the exception of the devices market. I know you called out industrial, automotive and infotech and data as being particularly weak, but I was hoping to get some additional granularity on what you're really seeing in terms of where the weaknesses is coming from, is it coming mostly from commentary from the [indiscernible], is it specifically U.S.-based, is it Europe based, any additional commentary on sort of what you're seeing would be helpful? R. Adam Norwitt : I think you're correct in one sense which is we do see slight changes across many of our markets. I think what both Craig and I talked about those, that the predominance of the change that we see and the change that's reflected in our guidance at the midpoint is really coming, roughly half of that coming from industrial and the remainder coming from auto and IT datacom, not to say that we don't see small changes in the others and I think you're correct in saying that more of those are negative than are positive, and that's the reflection of this overall market environment which as we've said appears to be more uncertain now than it was before. I talked about the fact that in automotive for example we see more of a reduction in expectations coming out of China. So that clearly has some geographical influence to it. As it relates to the industrial market broadly, there's no doubt about it that China and other emerging geographies, there has been some sort of step-down in the expectations or in the actual growth that is occurring in those markets, and that has kind of a knock-on effect across the industrial market. And whether that is in things like heavy equipment or whether that is in areas like medical or oil and gas, there's no doubt that that feels like it is a little bit of a broader geographical spread of where our customers are but the origin of where that uncertainty comes, may come more from those emerging markets as kind of the trigger to that weakening that we've seen in the expectations of our industrial customers. And I think the IT market is not wholly unrelated to that either, in that when you see an emerging market, some reductions, typically the IT market has a very strong fourth quarter that tends to be seasonally the strongest quarter as budgets flush and other things happen, and I think the moderation that we've seen there can also be somewhat linked back to that overall economic sense that may have started in emerging markets that says that maybe there's not going to be that pop-up spending coming here at the end of the year and those places \u2013 and then that has a carryon effect through the overall market. So I think that if you want to pin it on a geography, I wouldn't pin it specifically on one country like China or Brazil or Russia but there's no doubt that collectively across emerging markets there appears to be a less sanguine view of demand going into the fourth quarter. I mentioned also in my prepared remarks relative to industrial that the downturn in the commodities market has obviously been very severe, everybody is well aware of what has happened there, and I think there have been some well-reported knock-on effects of that across the industrial market and what that means for equipment and all of that. One could even look at something like oil and gas and draw a link to helicopters where we've seen a reduction in our commercial air and particularly in helicopters which was an important growth part of that, where the largest single purchaser of commercial helicopters is in fact the oil and gas industry and you can bet that they are purchasing a few less helicopters these days than they were. So I think there are some linkages from that that have some of those knock-on effects that you alluded to, but to find just one golden goose here in terms of what's causing that, that I wouldn't be able to do. Sherri Scribner : Okay, I think those comments were helpful. So thank you for that additional color. I also just on the automotive market, that's been a strong growth driver for you over the past couple of quarters, can you talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter in terms of auto production and what you're expecting for 4Q given that things are softening a bit and what's the outlook longer-term? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. I think we have never tied too much our results to just unit production, and I think that's very simply put because we see the opportunity to grow in the electronics in the car, we see a lot of electronics growing and we continue to outperform unit production just growing last quarter organically by 13%. Clearly that's well in advance of any unit production numbers that have either come out or expected to come out at this stage. So I wouldn't tell you that we have a good view on what units are going to do here in the fourth quarter. This is not where we focus on. I think we focus on servicing our customers at the various tiers of the automotive industry, and based on the information that we've gotten from them going here into the fourth quarter, we have adjusted our expectations accordingly, but I don't think we're a good read on what is the unit going to be in the automotive market. Operator : The next question came from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : First question, I just wanted to I guess the trends in the IT markets that you're seeing, the incremental weakness, is there any reasons to suggest that that's also not affecting the FCI business, so when that comes onboard, the revenue run rate that was highlighted at the time of the acquisition announcement is maybe a bit lower or a bit more challenged to growth dynamics? R. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Look, I mean, I think that what we see in the IT datacom market is probably not different from what others will see in that market, and then FCI being another player in that market, would they see some of that? That may very well be. I think the fact is we don't buy FCI for just their performance here in a quarter or two, we acquire that company with a long-term view that is a very positive long-term view of the benefits that come from the combination of Amphenol and FCI, and if there's something happening in the market in either the short-term or the medium-term, that doesn't change at all our expectations for the company nor our confidence that that's a great thing for Amphenol. Shawn Harrison : Okay. And then as a follow-up, I know it's tough to ask you to look out into 2016 and use a crystal ball, but are there end markets where you expect growth to be challenged or maybe potentially limited and no organic growth in 2016 given the trend you're seeing currently? R. Adam Norwitt : Look I think the crystal ball is not easy to exercise right now. I think we have just taken our expectations down here in the fourth quarter and I've talked a lot about why that is. What is that going to turn into as the calendar page turns into January, it's too early to say what that would be. I think that I mentioned in each of the markets those areas where we see that the Company still has great potential and great position, and as we look into next year, will there be some markets that will perform better than others and others that will perform worse than the rest, no doubt about it. I mean that's the beauty of the diversification of the Company. I think at this stage though it's too early to give kind of a prognosis about what may be starting here on January 1. Shawn Harrison : Fair enough, thanks as always. Operator : The next question came from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Adam, just first question real quick, I know you've given a lot of color on the markets, but when you think about the different distribution channels that you have cited as maybe showing some weakness, are there any that you would say were over-inventoried or would you say it's a fairly good reflection of demand, any color there will be appreciated? R. Adam Norwitt : I think we may have seen some slight inventory adjustments in the quarter in a few of those. I mean the areas where we have more distribution is industrial, commercial air and military. Those are the three markets where we have the most distribution presence. We have some limited distribution presence in others. But I think there was also sell-through. We certainly saw on the sell-through side that orders at sell-through and that limited visibility that we have across that 11% of our sales, were certainly started to moderate as the quarter went on. And so I don't know that there was significant inventory movement at that stage. Steven Fox : Okay, great. And then just specifically on the auto expectation, just relative to what the Company was thinking 90 days ago and now, I guess it will be interesting to sort of understand how much maybe was sort of Amphenol specific on where you had expected maybe programs to ramp that are delayed, whether they were mid-model upgrades or new models, et cetera, and how much was just pure unit demand, if there's any way to sort of provide color on that, it'd be appreciated? R. Adam Norwitt : I think the best I can say is virtually all of the changes that we've seen in the automotive market appear to be just generalised forecast reductions from customers. These were not due to program delays and certainly not due to losses of business that we had. That was just overall forecast coming down from customers. Now forecast can come down because of units, they can come down because of take rates, they can come down because of mix of units and the types of cars that are there. I think I mentioned in China for example that there is \u2013 while it's true that there are various stimulus programs that people have talked about, there's also some talk about the mix of cars and whether those are higher content or lower content cars that are being stimulated in China. That's one example maybe of an area where even if units are at a certain level, if the overall mix of the size of the cars and of the feature sets of those cars is different, that would naturally have some impact on us in the short-term. So I think that we certainly would not point to anything where we were losing or where there was a delay per se, it's just the forecasts are coming in lower. Operator : The next question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : First question was on M&A, I was hoping you could clarify if you closed any acquisitions in either the third quarter or quarter to date that you can point to. And then related to that, if you could just update us on the M&A landscape, and I know there's been some discussion on the topic already but if you can talk about the potential size of acquisitions that may be out there and just given that Amphenol is now a much larger company than it has been historically if there's either enough small deals or larger deals that are potentially available that can move the needle and still support the overall revenue growth as it has in the past? R. Adam Norwitt : No, we didn't close any deals in the quarter or announced any deals in the quarter. We certainly would let to know when and if we do. I did mention we have already closed three deals so far this year and we have signed another one, the FCI deal, and I think we feel very good about the M&A landscape. We have made over the last five years I think some 22, 23 acquisitions, maybe 25, Craig reminds me, and we have a really fabulous execution ability on those acquisitions. You asked a question, as the Company grows in size, how do we balance small deals versus larger deals? I think we have demonstrated how we do that. We continue to strive to find unique entrepreneurial kind of tuck-in acquisitions and we have a strong appetite still for those companies, and in the second quarter we acquired DoCharm and ProCom, both just really outstanding companies in their respective fields, and those are great acquisitions in that they bolster our capabilities either in a certain technology, in a certain region, with a certain set of customers. At the same time we continue to make larger deals and I think we announced the FCI deal. It was just a year ago September that we made the Casco acquisition, a year prior to that that we made the Advanced Sensors acquisition. So I think we have continued to find large sized transactions which can kind of move the needle at the same time as we continue to prosecute a great pipeline of tuck-in acquisitions, and we would view that very much the same going forward. The Company has just a great track record of M&A and our financial strength enables that, at the same time as our organizational structure and our culture enables us to assimilate those companies very smoothly, and I think that's a great advantage for the Company going forward. Mark Delaney : Thank you for those comments. And then for follow-up on the mobile networks market, I know 2014 was a very strong year on those, lots of build-outs, and so this year is partly impacted by some of the consolidation that's going on at the customer base and tough comps and maybe inventory reductions, I was hoping you could just kind of comment what your customers are suggesting this business can be at over the intermediate-term and is there still growth potential from further LTE build-outs as we go forward or should we expect lower growth to continue in mobile networks as we start thinking into 2016? R. Adam Norwitt : Look, I am obviously not a great forecaster of growth in mobile networks having taken our expectations down twice already this year, both at the end of the first quarter and the end of the second quarter, and we do see today, even if we grew in the third quarter on a sequential basis, we don't expect further growth here in the fourth quarter. I think it's safe to say that our view and the industry's view coming into this year was a more positive view of the mobile networks market than ultimately we think it's going to end up. And the reasons for that have been well written about, whether that is the digestion of last year's outstanding investments that were made, whether that's the variety of mergers and corporate combinations that have either been talked about or signed or executed upon, and there's also other kind of extraneous things that have happened, for example in China with the anticorruption investigations that have gone on and by all accounts have deferred some of the spending there. So what does that mean going into next year, I think it's very hard to give a prognosis at this stage, but I think what's very clear is that this is a market that is ultimately driven by consumer demand, consumers who are consuming more and more video on their devices, who are using their devices as kind of a replacement for their desktop, for their television, for their home computer, for their work computer. So as mobile devices become essentially the linchpin around which we revolve our technology live, I know personally that I just got a text message two days ago I was not so happy about when my kids blew through my huge monthly data plan and I had to pay another $15 three days ago. So there's no doubt about it that I don't think I'm the only one blowing through my data plan every month on my family shared data and there is a huge demand, growth in demand for data in the mobile networks market. How does that ultimately manifest itself in the spending, in the capital spending of the wireless operators around the world? That is a timing that is very difficult to give a prognosis on. I think we saw in the third quarter some incremental strength from North America and we are very pleased to be well-positioned for that. We have not seen that strength in places like Europe and Asia. There's been some signs of strength in India as an example. That's a market that we haven't seen a lot of strength in for three, four, five years. So I think for us the most important thing is that we are well-positioned and we continue to grow our position in all the places. When the spending comes, we'll be ready for it, we'll be well-positioned and we'll be the first phone call for our customers. Operator : Our final question came from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, I was just wondering with all the consolidation in the IT datacom space, do you see this ultimately as a market with an overall shrinking TAM for Amphenol as hardware moves to more commoditized platforms and companies move more to cloud-based deployments, and how do you think about the R&D deployment as it pertains to this end market and investing in like high-speed backplane connectors? R. Adam Norwitt : I think the simple answer is, we don't think of that as a shrinking TAM, Wamsi, but we do think of it as a changing TAM and we've talked a lot about that. There is no question that the consolidation is a reflection of a lot of changes in that marketplace. What used to be OEMs who would make boxes, put them and ship them to customers who needed some IT hardware, that has really changed and is in the process of flipping on its head. It's a slow flip, how that happens, that change towards the Web service providers and others, some of whom have taken it upon themselves to design and spec out their own equipment, but it is no doubt an enormous change in that market. It's actually a very exciting change for a company who can get on top and ahead of that, and I think that's something that we have really positioned ourselves to do. The reality is, if we look last quarter in the IT datacom market, we grew in local currencies about 4%, organically also about 4% last quarter, and I could tell you that a good portion if not all of that growth came from expansions that we've seen in sales to non-traditional customers. And so we continue to expand our position with these non-traditional customers in the IT datacom market on a global basis, and I think that as that settles out over time, we will have a great position there and whether that's in high-speed backplane products, whether that's in power products, whether that's in high-speed cable assemblies and I/O connectors and fiber optics, we have a wonderful product offering there that can service customers regardless of what part of the supply chain that they are in. No doubt about it, it's a changing TAM, but I would not say at all that that's a shrinking TAM long-term. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks Adam. And just to follow-up on your comment, would you say the non-traditional buyers have similar margin profile on your products relative to the traditional players? R. Adam Norwitt : Look, I mean we make good money on all what we sell. I think that I would not differentiate between them in terms of the potential. Ultimately, margin is related to how much value you can deliver to your customers, and I can tell you that customers across the IT datacom market have enormous needs for new technologies, and to the extent that you can enable their new technologies and their needs with your new technologies, then ultimately they are willing to pay a fair price, not a higher price, a fair price, and then it's incumbent on us to get our costs in the right position such that we can make money on any business that we participate in. Very good. I think, operator, it appears that that's our final question. At this time, Craig and I would like to once again thank all of you for your time today and we look forward to speaking to you again here in about three months. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day. A recording of this conference will be available for 30 days following this call. You may access the recorded conference by dialing 1-866-358-4539 or 203-369-0140. PIN is 7183. Thank you for participating. We will now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo and I am the Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. Q4 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales and EPS of $1.431 billion and $0.63. Sales were flat in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency sales in the fourth quarter increased 1%. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in both U.S. dollars and organically after a very strong third quarter. For the full year 2015, sales grew 4% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 3% organically compared to 2014. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was down 4% from last year primarily due to the effect of currency translations. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 1% from last year, reflecting the benefits of both organic growth and the company\u2019s acquisition program partially offset by currency translation. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income increased to $289 million in the fourth quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was a strong 20.2% equal to both the fourth quarter of 2014 as well as the third quarter of 2015. On an as-reported basis, operating margins were 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 12.5% compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4%, which is consistent with last year on similar sales levels. We are very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million compared to $20 million last year, reflecting the benefit of a lower average effective interest rate in the current quarter more than offsetting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s acquisition and stock buyback programs. The lower average rate is primarily a result of the implementation of a new commercial paper program. Other income was $4 million in the fourth quarter of \u201815 compared to $5 million last year and consists primarily of interest income on cash and short-term cash investments. The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 26.4% in the fourth quarter of \u201814, excluding one-time items. On an as-reported basis, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.2% in the fourth quarter of \u201814. Net income was a very strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 and EPS was $0.63 equal to the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding one-time items. For the full year 2015, EPS, excluding one-time items, was $2.43, up 8% over 2014, an excellent performance considering the current market environment. Orders for the quarter were $1.463 billion, a 2% increase over the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $322 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 159% of net income. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.030 billion or 133% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $852 million at the end of December, down 4% from September. Inventory days were 79 days, down 1 day compared to September. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.1 billion at the end of December, down approximately 5% from September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days consistent with September levels. Accounts payable was $588 million at the end of December, down approximately 11% from September levels. Payable days were 54 days, down 6 days compared to September levels and still within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $322 million, along with stock option proceeds of $25 million, were used primarily to reduce debt by approximately $27 million, to purchase approximately 53 million of the company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $39 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $162 million net of translation. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stock repurchase program. 5.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. The company used just under $1.2 billion of its cash and short-term investments net of cash acquired to fund the previously announced FCI acquisition on January 8. We are very pleased to have been able to fund the entire acquisition with cash on hand. Total debt at December 31 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $1 billion. After funding the acquisition of FCI, net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. At quarter end, the company had issued $824 million under its $1.5 billion commercial paper program and Q4 2015 EBITDA was approximately $343 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to just make a couple of comments relative to our guidance. As previously noted, we completed the acquisition of FCI on January 8, and consequently, the results of FCI will be included in the consolidated company results effective as of that date and therefore are incorporated in our guidance. For the full year 2016, we expect that the FCI acquisition will generate approximately $0.12 of accretion on sales of approximately $570 million. I would also note that while the acquisition is accretive to EPS, the inclusion of FCI in the company\u2019s consolidated results will reduce our operating income margin by approximately 90 to 100 basis points as FCI currently operates at a low double-digit operating income level. As we have previously stated, the management team is fully committed to improving FCI margins up to the average of the company over time. From a sales perspective, our guidance reflects an organic growth rate, excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts, of down 6% to down 3% in the first quarter of \u201816 and down 1% to up 2% for the full year of 2016. In addition, our guidance excludes any one-time charges associated with the FCI acquisition related to external acquisition transaction costs or other one-time acquisition related costs such as amortization of backlog or any one-time costs associated with improvements in cost structure. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig and it\u2019s my pleasure to also welcome all of you to our call here and I hope it\u2019s certainly not too late to wish each of you a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight a little bit our fourth quarter and as well as reflect back on our full year achievements in 2015. I will then spend some time to discuss the trends and our progress in our served markets. And then finally, I will make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year and of course we will have time at the end for questions. With respect to the fourth quarter, certainly our results in this quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings, despite what is clearly a heightened level of market uncertainty. Although we had expected some decline from prior year, our revenues ultimately were flat in U.S. dollars and increased by 3% in local currencies, reaching that level of $1.431 billion. I think Craig mentioned as well that the company booked a record $1.463 billion in orders, which represented a book to bill of 1.02 to 1. We are especially proud that in the quarter, we equaled our highest levels of profitability in the company\u2019s history as we sustained our industry leading operating margins at the same 20.2% that we achieved in the third quarter. In fact, over the last five quarters, three of those quarters we have achieved that 20.2%. Operating cash flow was another real highlight in the quarter as we reached a new record of $322 million of operating cash flow and actually free cash flow of $281 million. These are really just great confirmations of the company\u2019s discipline and financial strength. I am extremely proud of this Amphenol organization. Our results this quarter confirm once again the true value of our entrepreneurial culture as we once again exercised both the agility and the discipline necessary to perform well despite what are clearly significant and mounting uncertainties across the worldwide economy. Craig mentioned that we closed the FCI acquisition in \u2013 just here recently in January. And we are extremely excited to have completed that acquisition on January 8, after we finally received the last antitrust approval, which was from China at the end of December. FCI is the largest acquisition in the history of the company. It represents a significant expansion of our interconnect product offerings for customers in the IT datacom, industrial, mobile infrastructure, automotive and mobile devices markets. But most importantly, we have added a truly outstanding group of talented individuals to our organization. In fact just last week, we hosted a large group of the FCI management team here at our headquarters in Wallingford and what I can only confirm for you is that they are all truly excited to be part of the Amphenol organization. Looking into 2016, as Craig discussed we expect approximately $0.12 per share of accretion from the FCI transaction on revenues of approximately $570 million. Long-term, we look forward to capitalizing on the wide range of opportunities that will now be available to Amphenol, given our broader range of technologies and deeper penetration of customers in these many exciting markets that FCI brings us. And as we welcome this excellent new team to Amphenol, all I can say is that we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol into the future. Now with respect to the 2015, there is no question that 2015 was a very strong year for the company, in particular given the many economic and geopolitical disruptions that emerged throughout the year. First, we expanded our position in the overall market, growing our sales by 4% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies, ultimately reaching that new sales record of $5.569 billion. In addition, we expanded our operating margins to the new record of 19.9% for the full year while generating EPS of $2.43, both excluding one-time items. This represented a growth of 8% in EPS from prior year. We also had as you all know a very busy year in our acquisition program as in addition to FCI, we acquired Invotec, DoCharm and ProCom earlier in the year. These acquisitions are going to create great value for the company, in fact already are creating that value as we expand our position across really most of our served markets. And in particular, we have now been joined by a great range of new talented managers thereby strengthening our already impressive management team. In 2015, it\u2019s once again a reflection that our consistent focus on growing with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And in addition, our entrepreneurial organization has accelerated the development of innovative interconnect technologies in support of our simple but long-term mission to be the enabler of electronics revolution. These developments have allowed Amphenol to capitalize on exciting new markets and thereby have broadened the opportunity for our future expansion. While 2015 was not always an easy year, as we entered 2016 I can just say that our management team is highly confident that we have now built a new platform of strength from which we can drive even better long-term performance for many years to come. Now turning towards our progress across our various served markets, I just want to comment that our team remains extremely focused on maintaining a balance and diversified market position. And this is really an asset that becomes even more valuable during times of economic uncertainty. And I think we all know that we are in those times. In 2015, not one of our end markets represented more than 19% of our sales and I will just say with the acquisition of FCI, we continue to expect that no market will make up even 20% of our sales as we now see it. Turning to the markets, first the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year of 2015. Sales in the military market were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as growth in military airframe was offset by reductions in communications and rotorcraft. We were in fact pleased in the fourth quarter to see stronger than expected 4% sequential increase from the third quarter, with strength across most types of military equipment. For the full year 2015, our sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and were up 2% in local currencies in the military market. While the overall market has remained basically stable in 2015, we are pleased to be seeing the early signs of some renewed growth. Our team has done an excellent job of strengthening our overall market position during these most recent more moderate years as we have continued to expand our high technology product offering across many complex new equipment platforms. Looking into 2016, while we expect sales in the first quarter to remain roughly at the levels of the fourth quarter, we now expect to achieve growth in the low single-digits for the full year as we realize the benefits of our expanded content on new military equipment and as certain new programs launch. The Commercial Aerospace market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% also for the full year. Sales were down by 4% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies compared to prior year as stronger sales on to new airplane platforms were offset by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet related sales. We were actually very encouraged during the quarter to achieve a strong 12% sequential increase from our third quarter sales levels, which was driven in particular by ramp ups of new large jet programs. For the full year 2015, our sales declined by 7% in U.S. dollars and just slightly in local currency driven by reductions in commercial helicopter and business jets sales. And we believe that that was related in part to the significant declines in the purchases of such equipment by oil and gas companies. Regardless of this more challenging market environment in 2015, we are very pleased with our continued progress across the commercial end market as we have taken excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next generation jetliners, which we are enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect sales to remain at or slight above these levels in the first quarter and we expect to return to solid growth for the full year as production volumes of certain new planes ramp up, creating an exciting long-term opportunity for the company. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales both in the quarter and for the full year. Sales in this market grew by actually a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency and that was driven in particular by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy segments as well as by some contribution from the Goldstar acquisition we made last year. And this was offset in part by significant and continued declines in our sales to customers in the oil and gas segment. Sequentially, our sales grew by a higher than expected 6%, resulting also from strength in those same segments. For the full year of 2015, sales in the industrial market grew by 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency as the contributions from our acquisition program, together with that same strength in hybrid bus and truck, heavy equipment and alternative energy was in part offset by the significant declines in oil and gas. I can just say that we remain very proud of our diversified industrial businesses and we have continued to make progress selling an ever broader range of interconnect sensor and antenna products into the many growth segments of this market. Now with the addition of FCI, we have significantly strengthened our position across a wide array of embedded computing applications in the industrial market and we believe that this highly complementary offering is going to create an excellent long-term growth platform for the company. For the first quarter, we anticipate sales to increase from the current levels due to the benefit from the FCI acquisition and looking towards the full year of 2016, we now expect sales growth in the high-teens in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from contributions of FCI together with moderate organic growth from the many segments of the industrial market. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as in the full year of 2015. Sales in that market increased a very strong 5% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. And this was driven by stronger sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected and slightly exceeded our Q3 levels. For the full year 2015, we are very pleased to have achieved another year of excellent growth as our sales grew by 23% in U.S. dollars, 33% in local currency and 12% organically. This is an outstanding year by any industry comparison for our automotive products. Our successful strategy has included driving an expanded range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified range of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, while at the same time identifying complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from this approach for many years to come. For the first quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from current levels. And for the full year 2016, we expect to achieve mid to high single-digit growth as we continue to benefit from our recent acquisitions as well as our expanded range of automotive electronics into which our interconnect and sensor products are designed. The mobile devices market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2015. Our performance in this market was actually somewhat stronger than we had expected as sales were essentially flat to prior year and down by 14% sequentially from our very strong third quarter. Once again, our team demonstrated their incredible dynamic agility as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of this sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any upside opportunities for incremental sales that became available in the market. For the full year of 2015, our sales in the mobile devices market increased a very strong 13% from prior year, driven by growth in next-generation laptops, mobile accessories as well as production-related products for customers in the mobile market. We remain very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the ever dynamic mobile devices market and are encouraged by our excellent technology positions that run across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. In particular, mobile functionality continues to be integrated into an ever broader array of devices, expanding the growth opportunity for our interconnect and antenna products. Looking into the first quarter, we now expect a sequential reduction in sales of approximately 30% due to normal seasonality as well as the impact from strong ramp-ups that occurred during the second half of 2015. This decline is roughly similar to the seasonal decline that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. At this point, we expect sales for the full year 2016 to be slightly down from our 2015 levels. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic and agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this always exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year. And our sales in this market were a bit better than expected, but still declined from prior year by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies. Sequentially, our sales were essentially flat to the third quarter as growth in sales to wireless equipment manufacturers was offset by a normal seasonal decline in sales to service providers. No question that 2015 was a very challenging year in the mobile infrastructure market as our sales declined 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency, primarily due to a pause in spending by many wireless operators around the world. Nevertheless, we have continued to expand our position with customers around the world in the mobile infrastructure market. And in particular, we have made great strides in developing new interconnect and antenna products that are integrated into next-generation wireless systems. Looking into the first quarter as well as the full year 2016, we do expect a significant increase in our sales to the mobile infrastructure market due to the contributions from the FCI acquisition. While we do not at this time though expect overall spending environment to improve, our broadened product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on the opportunities that will arise when spending inevitably resumes in the future. Now, turning to the information technology and datacom market, sales in this market represented 15% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 16% of our sales for the full year 2015. As we had expected, our sales were down slightly from prior year as well as prior quarter as sales moderated in products that are integrated into servers, storage and networking equipment. For the full year of 2015, our sales grew by 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency as declines that we saw in storage and networking products were offset by increased sales into server applications, together with the strong progress that we have made selling into the new generation of web and datacenter customers. Regardless of this current moderation in growth, I could just say that we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising Web 2.0 and datacenter customers. Now, with the acquisition of FCI, we have truly the leading product offering for customers across all areas of the IT datacom market and this positions us very strongly as customers adapt to deal with the significant expansion of data traffic in all aspects around the world. Both our traditional as well as the new generation of customers are driving their datacenter equipment to new levels of performance in order to handle the rapid expansion of data that\u2019s driven in particular by the proliferation of new mobile devices as well as by the continuing spread of video on the Internet and cloud computing. Looking ahead to the first quarter and the full year 2016, we expect a significant increase in our sales due to the FCI acquisition. And we continue to look forward to creating great long-term value with our many investments in this space. Finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter as well as for the full year. And sales decreased slightly in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies from prior year as domestic MSO build-out activity slowed due to the traditional seasonality in that space. Sales were down slightly from the third quarter because of that seasonality. For the full year, our sales were down by 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency. And essentially, we were impacted by both the reduction in capital spending due to the many corporate consolidations that have occurred or are occurring in the broadband market together with the slowdown in spending by operators in certain regions, in particular Latin America, which as a result more due to the significant currency devaluations in that region. For the first quarter, while we expect demand to increase moderately from our current levels, we do believe that it\u2019s still too early to expect growth for the full year of 2016. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many consolidations that are ongoing, we will be very well-positioned to capitalize with our expanded range of interconnect and cable products on the growth opportunities that will, no doubt, emerge. So, let me just say with respect to 2015, I am just extremely proud of our performance. While the global economy did weaken throughout the course of the year and the market environment remains even today very uncertain, the Amphenol organization continued and continues to execute extraordinarily well, both organically as well as through our acquisition program to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance. The company\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, increasing position with customers in diverse markets, worldwide presence, our lean and very flexible cost structure combined all with our agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to the outlook. As I have already mentioned several times, there continues to be a great deal of market uncertainty around the world and accordingly and based on a continuation of the current economic environment as well as on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2016 the following results. For the first quarter, we anticipate sales in the range of $1.380 billion to $1.420 billion and EPS excluding one-time items, in the range of $0.55 to $0.57 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 4% to 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% to 9% in local currency and an EPS change of down 4% to flat the prior year. For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6.04 billion to $6.2 billion and EPS excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.54 to $2.62, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth of 8% to 11% and 5% to 8% over 2015 levels. In constant currencies, this guidance represents a year-over-year growth of 9% to 12%. We are very, very encouraged by our current and strong outlook in sales and earnings, especially given the many dynamics across the global economy. And I am extremely confident that in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our newly established record levels of revenues and EPS and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016. And with that, Operator we would be very happy to take whatever questions there may be. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question came from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks and good afternoon and happy New Year Adam and Craig. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Matt Sheerin : First, I have just a couple of questions actually on FCI. I know when you announced the deal last summer, I think you said it was at $600 million run rate for FY \u201815 and now you are guiding around $570 million this year, I know they have a lot of distribution exposure, what was the run rate coming out of 2015 and did they see the same weakness that other semiconductor and component suppliers saw in the distribution channel, was that why the number is lower now? Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much for the question. I wouldn\u2019t actually say that it\u2019s related necessarily to distribution channel. At the time we gave the guidance, I think there is two aspects of why the $600 million becomes $570 million. Number one is FCI certainly was impacted by currency as other companies were. They have similar, if not even slightly more exposure to certain currencies. And so there is a significant impact of currency translation. In addition, we closed on the deal in January 8, so we lose a solid week of sales in the year. And I would just tell you that if you think about the markets where FCI is, we have what I consider a relatively prudent and conservative outlook in those markets looking forward. And I would say that FCI is no different than that. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that there is any significant change in terms of distribution that is any different from what maybe we have seen nothing. That\u2019s not the big thing happening. Matt Sheerin : Got it. And I know you talked about, Craig mentioned the plan to improve margins and get the FCI operating margins to the Amphenol level, could you give us a little bit more color on how you plan to get there in potential timeframe? Craig Lampo : Sure, be happy to do that. As we previously mentioned, we don\u2019t integrate companies in a traditional sense. We certainly will look at the overall cost, cost structure and to maximize certainly the value of their great technology that they do have. I think what we will do is, over time look at certainly all these aspects of their cost structure, look at their organizational structure and whatnot and certainly we will be able to \u2013 we are confident we will be able to increase the margins over that time. This is certainly not going to be an overnight action. We are certainly in the process of working with management to go through kind of the details of the organization. But we are very confident and that we would be able to bring the profitability levels up over some time period. Adam Norwitt : Yes. And the only thing that I would maybe add to that is the management team from FCI, they have also that same aspiration. We have seen this in many times with acquisitions that we have made where the performance of that company has may be at somewhat less of a level than ours. They always from the outside, say how is it that they can do it and as soon as they come into Amphenol, they start to see how there is that sort of cultural ability to achieve those high margins and there is nothing better than a little bit of a peer interaction to help that same management team find ways to spend less or sell the product at a higher value wherever that may be. Ultimately, with FCI just like it is with every one of our businesses, it comes down to the margin is the price less the cost and I think that there will be many actions that can be taken on both sides of that equation. But the most important action is already there, which is that the team is committed to it. When does it happen, ultimately what\u2019s the timing of that, this is a very hard thing to predict at this stage. And I think we have taken an approach to guide towards the margins as they are today. Over time, though we remain very confident that we will bring that to close to if not above the levels of the company. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks. I have a question and a follow-up as well. So I guess maybe to start up on FCI question, Adam when you guys announced the deal, you also talked about low to mid-teens operating margins of FCI, I think the guidance implies 9% or so operating margins, so just maybe explain what\u2019s the delta there if there is mark to market accounting or something else that\u2019s driving it lower? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think what Craig mentioned is that it\u2019s low double-digit operating margins in the company. As you know when you make an acquisition, there are various things you have to do with amortization and other aspects that are related to acquisitions. But we think that that\u2019s a low double-digit operating income company today. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then just broadly, given the market volatility you are seeing, I would love to get your perspective on your desire to execute further deals post FCI. And really as you look at deals moving forward, your leverage is around 1.7 times I think right now, is there an appetite to do $1 billion plus kind of transactions as they come up or would like to do more to tuck-in deals as you go forward? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think we have always said and we remain very committed to the fact that we want to stay as an investment grade company. In particular, when markets are turbulent like they are today, I think the investment grade rating is a very important thing. That being said, we still have a lot of capacity. And I think Craig talked about that that we have still significant capacity remaining even where we were to get to investment grade. The reality is our position as an acquirer of preference for companies around the world, that has not changed and that continues to grow and we have an excellent pipeline of acquisitions. Are we going to make another FCI tomorrow, I guess probably not. But do we have a great pipeline of acquisitions, a variety of sizes and are we committed to continuing to drive our acquisition program, which has created so much value for the company, no doubt about it we are still very committed to that program. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Wood of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Mike Wood : Hi, excellent job navigating this very tough market. First question, just wanted to get some help on the guidance bridge, it looks like the currency that you had guided to roughly offsets the FCI accretion, so I am just curious with flat organic growth if you could just maybe point to one or two things that\u2019s driving the majority that roughly $0.15 earnings bridge to your midpoint. And I am wondering embedded in that if there is some prior acquisition margin ramps like from advanced sensors or something? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think Mike, it\u2019s not quite clear what you are asking, but it appears that what you are asking is did we have here a slightly higher conversion margin on our organic sales. And if that\u2019s what you are asking, there is maybe a slightly higher conversion margin on that. We have an environment right now that we think there can be some slight positive impact from some of the commodity benefits that we had. And we started to see, Craig mentioned that we saw a little bit of benefit in the quarter in our cable business. And you can bet that our team is being very aggressive on that. But overall, we think that is still a guidance that is well in line with the profitability trends of the company. Mike Wood : Okay, great. That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to understand. And then just Adam from your perspective managing the business, is there any \u2013 in terms of how you manage day-to-day given this market volatility, what do you do proactively, do you react to market movements to try to cut costs in front of potential contagion risk or are you just sort of looking at how trends are coming in and running it as a normal course of business? Adam Norwitt : So I am going to be a little flip in a second, which is to say that we spent two decades building a culture of a company that has then the inherent agility at the Street management level to react to changes. That\u2019s number one thing we do. That\u2019s not something you can do overnight. It\u2019s something we have spent the better part of two decades kind of incubating and developing in the culture of the company. And I think I have mentioned many times in the past for those especially who followed us through many cycles that in a time of turbulence, this is really when the Amphenol management team excels the most, because we have around the world 90 plus general managers. Those general managers are facing customers every day as they are going back from the customers with the information that they have gathered and they are going into the factory to allocate and arrange their resources. And you can bet in certain times that they are hearing from customers not positive news and when they are hearing not positive news, they don\u2019t report to someone who reports to someone who reports to someone at headquarters and then we make sort of a big decision about what to do, they go back to their factory that say, hey, I don\u2019t see the orders, I better adjust my resources and that can mean cutting cost with people, that can mean cutting spending, that can mean redeploying towards growth opportunities, whatever it is. That\u2019s the essence of the agility that is embodied and really across this entire organization. So, in a time like this where everybody wants to sort of buckle their seatbelts, because it doesn\u2019t feel like a very smooth flight, this is when the Amphenol team buys new pairs of shoes, gets out there, makes sure that they are getting real-time information from customers, goes back, make some real-time cost adjustments, real-time resource reallocations to make sure that we preserve strong operating performance and we expand our market position. That\u2019s the playbook that we have had through many cycles. God forbid, if we go into a cycle like that, we are going to have that same playbook. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a quick question, Craig, on the assumptions for SG&A as we move into fiscal \u201816. How should we model SG&A with the FCI acquisition trying to understand what hits SG&A and what hits the gross margin line for FCI? Craig Lampo : Sure. No problem. Yes, in regards to SG&A, as you know, the company Amphenol continues to tightly manage SG&A to maximize return on certainly this very important customer-facing resource of the company, we have always deployed a very strong return on investment policy with both our sales and engineering efforts. With the inclusion of FCI which currently carries a higher level of SG&A, we expect to see an increase in our SG&A for 2016 with our overall SG&A percent probably increasing about 80 to 90 basis points, I would think probably you can include. And then if you want to think about on the gross margin side, I would just add that although FCI does have slightly lower margins, I wouldn\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to have such an impact on the company overall. Sherri Scribner : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Adam, I wanted to ask you a big picture question. You mentioned a number of times that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. It seems like the industrial segment has gotten a little bit weaker. There is a lot of concern about China. Could you maybe talk about what you are seeing maybe specifically in China and then also what you are seeing on the industrial side? I know you provided some detail, but it was a little bit masked by the growth related to FCI. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter relative to industrial was actually a pretty positive result compared to what we had thought coming into the quarter. You remember, Sherri, very well as we came into the quarter, we saw some signs of a pullback from customers in the industrial market. And it seemed to be really very much related to this turbulence in the many emerging markets. I think I gave a lot of credit to our organization and by the way some of that organization in China that we have worked to identify where there are segments of growth in industrial. So, I mentioned maybe a new piece of business that we haven\u2019t talked about before as part of industrial and that\u2019s this whole universe of hybrid transportation equipment. As an example, our team just did a phenomenal job over the last year or two to ferret out this whole new area that is there that is really harsh environment, hybrid performance going into things like buses and trucks. And as you probably know, China is an area where that is happening more than any place in the world. And so the reality is actually our business in China in the fourth quarter did pretty well, because we had really ferreted out some of these new things. I mean, you think we grew in industrial year-over-year 10% in local currencies in the quarter and that\u2019s with oil and gas being down by a very, very significant amount. As we look at the guidance going into the year, I think we continue to have a favorable outlook for the industrial market. Organically, we expect it to be kind of mid single-digit growth for the year. And I think that that\u2019s a very robust outlook actually given all what one reads in the paper everyday, which seems to be not a great time to be reading paper these last few days. So, I think that \u2013 and that\u2019s coming again from our organization really poking their necks everywhere they can and ferreting out growth opportunities and then executing really fast to capitalize on those and to redeploy the resources towards those growth opportunities. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thanks. Adam, you highlighted just the strength of the combined company with FCI and IT. Any other end markets you trust in terms of where you will have more of a critical mass or strategic place? And then also from a geographic perspective kind of what FCI does for you? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thank you very much, Craig. I definitely hired an IT. I think I also mentioned in mobile infrastructure where we have just a tremendous span of presence. And then industrial, I talked about the fact that what we get with FCI is something that we have really never had and we have in all honesty struggled to build organically, which is a real pervasive presence across embedded computing on a broad sense. And the embedded computing revolution that\u2019s happening in the industrial market whether that be in places like factory automation, in energy management, in heavy equipment, wherever I mean you can go up and down the list of industrial applications where they are putting more sensors and there is more processing power and thus there is more embedded computing. And it is that sort of excellent job that the FCI team has done to repurpose essentially very robust computer interconnect products, some of which are not so new, but repurposing them into those embedded computing applications where the reliability of the product becomes such a premium. So, I think those we see all really, really real strengthening of our position. Relative to geographic, I think that FCI, as we have talked about in the past, they have a significant position in Asia, but they also have a very strong position in the North American and European distribution channels. And I view that the strength in the distribution channel is really one and the same with the geographical strength that it brings, because it allows us access with those types of products that we haven\u2019t had in the past. So, I think that there is really strength both from market and a regional perspective. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then just as my follow-up, in mobile devices, you guys have done a good job growing that business, as we see smartphones start to slow and you guys have also kind of navigated and your end market mix has shifted overtime with new opportunities. So just curious, as that market slows, do you think you can still drive new opportunities or content or will you see better growth opportunities in other end markets as you go forward? Adam Norwitt : Well, look I think I have just said relative to our guidance that we do expect that market to be down moderately coming into 2016. It\u2019s a very volatile space. It\u2019s one where we came in to 2015 with relatively muted expectations. Ultimately, our team was able really to outperform in that space growing for the full year essentially by 13%, which was certainly not what we had expected coming into the year. But it is a very hard market to kind of put a line in the sand on and say that\u2019s \u2013 we do anticipate to grow. So, we are taking what I believe is the prudent, but a necessarily prudent approach to our outlook for the market. That being said, I tell you that we continue to grow our position. And we grow our position with a range of customers. Obviously, it\u2019s not like there is millions of customers out there. So, there is some concentration in the customer base, but we continue to diversify. We continue to attract new applications. If you look at where the growth came this year, it wasn\u2019t necessarily, for example, from something like tablets, which several years ago had driven a lot of our growth. We saw more growth coming out of new-generation interconnected laptops, which years ago, we didn\u2019t work in laptops. And now, we seem to have built a very significant business there as laptops become essentially mobile devices. So, what will it ultimately be? What will the kind of new architecture of mobile be? This is very hard for us to predict. Will we continue to have a very strong position and will we capitalize on every opportunity that we see? No doubt about it. And I think nobody executes like the Amphenol team in the mobile devices market. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, can you comment on the auto end market, it\u2019s been very strong growth for your organically, how are you viewing production versus content growth and any regional color that you might share would also be helpful here in 2016 and I have a follow-up? Adam Norwitt : Great. Thank you very much, Wamsi. I think I have already shied away from talking too much about content versus unit volume. To be honest, we don\u2019t pay for all these reports. I couldn\u2019t even tell you exactly what content growth is and what unit volume growth is. I think I read the same papers, but I know there is lots of other detailed studies that we don\u2019t pay for. What I can tell you is our growth is clearly above the market. When we look at our performance here in the year of 2015, whether that was in the fourth quarter or whether that was the full year, growing 12% organically for the year, growing 33% in local currencies, there is no question, this is a very strong report. And as we look into 2016, I think we continue to have a strong guidance with real mid to high single-digit organic growth and a very positive outlook there. So where does that come from, it\u2019s clearly not just coming from units. I think that\u2019s very clear. So it\u2019s coming from our penetration to new applications, what I would say is a broadening range of new applications and also a broadened base of customers. I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we have made a lot of excellent acquisitions. And one of the great things that we have got through our acquisition program in automotive beyond just the product capability is access to OEMs and vehicle manufacturers where traditionally we may not have had that open door. And I think that, that has been a real great asset, in particular as we now have a product offering ranging from interconnect to sensors and even to antennas in the automotive market. From a regional perspective, I would just tell you that in the quarter, we actually saw on a year-over-year basis not bad performance in a place like Asia. Actually sequentially even we grew in Asia by double digits and I think the difference between our original expectations in the automotive market and ultimately, the results that we were able to get was in part due to a great job that our team did in Asia to drive sales. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks Adam. Thanks for the color. For my follow-up, on mobile devices did you see incremental deterioration on demand as you went through the course of the quarter and your guidance was slightly down year-on-year for the full year, is that a function of just market declines or is there any share changes options within that and do you have any production related accessories sales that you expect in 2016? Thanks. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. So the answer \u2013 let me answer it in reverse order. We do continue to have some production related accessories sales in 2016. I think that over the course of the fourth quarter, you naturally see a declining rate of sales during the quarter because the beginning of the quarter tends to be stronger sales than towards the end of the quarter. So I think that we would have expected that and we did see that. I mentioned that our sales in the quarter were a little stronger than we had come into but still over the course from October through to December, certainly you saw lower sales in December than you saw in October. And with respect to our guidance for the full year, we do not anticipate any share loss across. But on the other hand, we don\u2019t win everything. So there is always new programs, there is always new positions that you have on new products, but there is no share loss that we would note or that we have noted across any of our business in mobile. It is just a volatile space where each new thing comes out, you fight for as much content as you can get. And then you see how many the customers are going to sell of it. And then you react accordingly and you get your resources in the right position to support that demand. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. You may now ask your question. Steven Fox : Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I was just curious Adam, if we could \u2013 if you could talk a little bit higher level about the markets. You are calling for about flat organic growth for the full year, my understanding of the company is historically you do better than the markets which seems implied more of your markets going down and up, I was curious which markets you are most concerned about under that premise and which ones do you think have some organic growth prospects besides your own ability to grow above the market that you can take advantage, which ones are more positive? And then I had a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Steve. I think I would \u2013 I think I went over most of that in the prepared remarks, but I would just say that we have probably a more positive view of military, of commercial air, industrial and automotive and we have a less positive view of mobile devices, broadband, wireless infrastructure and IT datacom. I think that in a nutshell, how we see the markets. I think those latter four markets we would expect to be essentially flattish organically at a market level. Obviously, we have a big impact on wireless infrastructure and IT datacom with FCI. So we will report certainly strong sales growth in those markets. But our organic expectations are more muted in that space. On the contrary, we feel very good about automotive, about industrial, aerospace. And as I mentioned very early on, we start to see some renewed signs, green shoots, if you will of growth in the military market. Steven Fox : Great. And then if I could just follow-up real quickly on the FCI deal, my understanding is that a lot of the value, obviously not all of the value was with the technology that you mentioned in the data center and datacom area, can you just sort of talk about how that may be either accelerate your growth or how you take advantage of those products as part of Amphenol a little bit more, you have alluded to it a few times, but if there is any examples you can give, that would be great? Adam Norwitt : Sure. No, look I think number one, I would just modify it slightly, which is we see a lot of benefit of the product and the technologies from FCI in the IT datacom, but we also see that in mobile infrastructure and we see that absolutely in the industrial space where we also have very complementary and additive high-technology products. But with respect to IT datacom, we have talked for several quarters about the real transformation that\u2019s happening in that space, where you have a kind of generational shift whereby the balance of power is moving towards these service providers, be they are web service providers, data center service providers or whatever you want to call them. And many of those are really kind of calling the technology shots today whereas before, they were just unpacking boxes of stuff and configuring it. And I think in such an environment, the ability to present to those customers are kind of an A to Z product offering that helps them reach their price performance requirements is more critical than ever before. It used to be that you could have a couple of pillar products, you could work with the couple of box builders and you could know that, that product was what the box builder needed. Today, the range of customers that you have to work with and interface with is so much broader that if you don\u2019t have a product offering that fills essentially every hole, whether that be in high-speed connectors, whether that be in power connectors, in I/Os, in cable assemblies, you run the real risk of missing out on the one that ultimately will grow. And I think with FCI, we eliminate that risk wholeheartedly. We get a total A to Z offering. We can walk into customers of any nature and say you tell us what you need and we have it, somewhere on that ultimate price performance curve that the products all fall on. And I think that that is something that will over the long-term, pay great dividends for the company. Obviously, here I am talking about an IT datacom market in 2016, where we had a more modest expectation. But I think that is something that is commensurate with the market environment that we are in. It is a very uncertain environment. IT spending also it\u2019s a capital item and I think that at the end of the day, capital spending tends to be a bit more constrained when the markets are crazy like they are today. Ultimately though, data is flowing at speeds unlike we have ever imagined, applications are growing logarithmically and people need to equip their data centers and their networks with the equipment ultimately that can handle those speeds. And we are going to have the best solution for it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Good afternoon Adam. Adam Norwitt : Hello Shawn. Shawn Harrison : Wanted to just get into I guess the mobile networks business, it sounds like you have a dour outlook again for the market and I am wondering if there is any signs of life out there because it\u2019s been probably about 18 months since we have seen I think any positive growth and all regions were down in 2015 and so if can you just maybe comment on what you are seeing globally in that market and if there is the potential for it to rebound at any point in time in the year? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean look, dour and dour, I think we have an outlook essentially for the market organically to be at about the level that is it this year. So, that\u2019s certainly less dour than it was in 2015 when we were down 13% in local currencies. I think 2014 we were up by a significant amount. If I recall, 23%, 24% increase. So, I don\u2019t know about six quarters, even if maybe the first half of 2014 was a little stronger than the second half. I think in the fourth quarter, essentially our sales were flat to the third quarter and that is in a quarter where normally you would be down sequentially. So, if you talk about signs of life, I think one could interpret that flat performance in the fourth quarter where normally you see that to be down is maybe not the worst sign that one ever sees. I think that ultimately, they will \u2013 there is developing like there was last time a pent-up demand for capacity and coverage that needs to be, one day, solved. And to solve that pent-up demand, it will take equipment, it will take antennas, it will take the interconnect products that we have and it will be upon us who has really the broadest range of products at least in our industry to support both the OEMs and the operators. In fact, last quarter, I think I mentioned we actually saw growth from the OEMs on a year-over-year basis and that was the first quarter in I would say three or four that we saw OEM growth in wireless infrastructure. It is normal in the fourth quarter to see the operators down a little bit. From a regional basis, I would tell you that we have seen actually pretty good performance in North America in the wireless infrastructure market at least in the recent quarter. And we have started to see actually in Asia some pretty solid signs here, in particular in place like India. India is going through quite a significant infrastructure build. We seem to be at the early stages of that. And our team has done an excellent job to position ourselves. I am never going to bet on India in terms of a market, but I will tell you that we are very strongly positioned in India and to the extent that they do ultimately build that the levels that they have that can be also another sign of life for mobile networks. Shawn Harrison : Okay. And then as a follow-up, just I think the free cash flow dynamics of Amphenol are well understood, but what is the free cash flow profile of FCI like is it very similar to Amphenol? So we expect similar free cash flow return of the FCI business for fiscal \u201816 as Amphenol generates? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I would say that it\u2019s actually very similar to Amphenol. So, that\u2019s I think a good way to think about it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Will Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, I am wondering if you can give us an update on your sensor product category traction with clients and remind us, is the end market exposure there tilted somewhat towards automotive or industrial? And any update on that category would be helpful. Adam Norwitt : Yes, I think we feel very pleased. We just finished two years as a sensor company. In fact, we acquired the GE advanced sensor business. I think it was December 5, 2013. So, it really just finished our two years. And I can tell you that we feel really good about the progress and we added obviously Casco a year later and that is \u2013 I can just say that that\u2019s a very positive impression, both with our customers as well as internally. There has been a lot of collaborative initiatives between engineers across the company. We have seen some nice wins with customers where maybe they would not have had access and we have also seen great reception from some customers where we didn\u2019t have a strong access before with our interconnect products. So I tell you from my perspective I give it a real strong grade, a solid A, let me say, in terms of our experience. In terms of the end market exposure, advanced sensors when we bought it was about two-thirds industrial, one-third automotive and then Casco was essentially all automotive. So, I would say that our business is roughly balanced between automotive and industrial. And within industrial, again there is a diversification ranging from heavy equipment to medical to automated building products and things like that. So, there is a great diversification in that. And within the automotive, there is a very strong geographical diversification and OEM diversification as well as the types of sensors, pressure and temperature and otherwise the types of sensors that we are selling into those applications. So, we feel great about the deals. We feel great about the progress so far. And we continue to actively look for new ways to expand both organically and through acquisition. Will Stein : If I can just follow-up with one more, we have talked a bit \u2013 you have talked a bit today about what sounds like a bit more of a uniqueness or strategic benefit of FCI and that\u2019s in the embedded end market. Is that \u2013 am I summarizing that correctly? Are there other end markets where there is a more unique advantage that FCI builds out for Amphenol? It was my impression that the company\u2019s exposure to distribution might be part of that. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, distribution, we have talked about from day one with FCI that it is a great asset for us. 40% of their sales are through distribution. And I think I have mentioned before, but I will reiterate that the strength that we see is not that we are not exposed to those distributors, we certainly are and we are bigger than they are, those distributors, but they are exposed to the part of those distributors that markets into areas that we have not been successful. So, we have been very strong with our harsh environment, military, aerospace and industrial products and they have been much stronger in identifying and working with distributors on new IT datacom, embedded computing and all of those areas where we just have not had the traction, because we didn\u2019t have the shelf space of the products. And so I think that is a big advantage. Industrial is one which I have already spoken extensively about today. I think that in the IT datacom market, FCI did an outstanding job. And I would say in part because they have just a phenomenal reach into places like Taiwan and China. They did a fabulous job attacking the new generation of ODM and new generation of IT datacom, new customers, the nontraditional, let me say. And while our team has done also an excellent job there, FCI was even a few steps ahead of us in that respect. And so I think that\u2019s another real additive thing that we get with FCI. The other thing that we get with FCI irrespective of the market position is capabilities that are truly second to none in certain respects, plating technology, manufacturing in certain areas, low cost areas of products that we don\u2019t make in those areas. So, there is a whole range also of capabilities that we are very excited about. And I can tell you, our respective teams are spending a lot of time together right now to identify kind of the low hanging fruit around where the collaboration can create value for the company. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I have a question and a follow-up and I will ask them at the same time. The question is I think I heard you, Adam, talk about mobility of being down 30%, which if my numbers are right, it look like that\u2019s pretty normal. So, if you can just confirm that? But the real question is then I think I heard you say you expect it to be down slightly for this year. And I kind of scratch my head, because the smartphone market is expected to grow. So, are you kind of deemphasizing some things or is your exposure causing you to do that just because it\u2019s really not like the industry is expecting the handset industry to be down. I mean, there is some other part of the business I am missing. And then the follow-up question is on the industrial side, it seems like we saw some strength and if I heard right, correctly, the hybrid bus and truck did well. Is that sustainable or is that more driven by some credits or some type of programs that came up and went away or just kind of wondering because it\u2019s kind of surprising and encouraging to hear about strength in industrial? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thank you, Jim. These are three very good questions. With respect to mobility, I think you did the right calculation, 30% down. And as I said, that\u2019s similar to what we saw in prior year and I think even for the last three years almost. And I think I already addressed our outlook for the year. I will just summarize maybe, which is that yes, we do see that our sales will be down slightly for the year. We take a very prudent approach to this market. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s extremely hard to predict and one that\u2019s volatile. We came into 2015 also with a very muted expectation. And ultimately, we did a lot better. But that was not something that you can see coming into the year. What are the expectations for smartphone growth? What are the expectations for tablets, for laptops, for all the accessories that are there? I don\u2019t know. If you add them all up together, does that reflect the market that is growing or not growing? I think you can read five reports and get five different answers right now. So, what we do is we guide based on what we are seeing. But as I said earlier, we are not expecting and nor do we anticipate any losses per se. And I think I addressed that already. With respect to industrial, I mentioned this kind of new and exciting area of hybrid heavy trucks and buses and is that related to credit, I don\u2019t know necessarily that that\u2019s related to credits. I think it\u2019s related to really dirty air. And so I think that there is a lot of places in the world who are coming to terms with the fact that their air is not breathable and they are doing things about it. And I don\u2019t know that, that is necessarily a short-term trend. I think that is a trend that is probably at the beginning stages of such a trend. Will that always be a driver of growth over time, we will see. But I think our team has done a great job to position themselves and position ourselves in a new and exciting area and what is otherwise an industrial market that certainly sees its ups and downs. Operator : Thank you. Our final question came from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions. First question was on FCI, of the $570 million forecast for this year, can you help us understand the split between your different end markets, so is it a quarter industrial and 50% IT datacom, etcetera? Adam Norwitt : Yes. We are not going to dive too deeply into the real specific splits of FCI, but let\u2019s just say in order I would say it\u2019s IT datacom, industrial, mobile infrastructure and then automotive and a little bit of mobile devices, kind of in that order. Mark Delaney : Okay. And then for a follow-up question also on FCI, I mean I know traditionally, Amphenol runs the companies that it acquires independently unless its franchises, I mean just given the size of FCI and you talked about a plan to improve the margins, are you expecting to do anything there differently in terms of integrating some of the manufacturing where some of the Amphenol products are built in former FCI factories, etcetera? Adam Norwitt : Yes. No, we are not integrating it per se. We are not restructuring, closing, consolidating facilities. The one thing we are doing is that we have running FCI as of the time it\u2019s joined Amphenol an individual who has been with Amphenol for a long time. He was actually the individual who shepherded us \u2013 shepherded the TCS company into Amphenol 10 years before. He has been with the company \u2013 with TCS for more than 27 years, been with Amphenol for more than a decade and he knows exactly what it takes to bring a large enterprise into Amphenol and to really go through the cultural transformation that is something that takes time, but takes also great focus. The prior executive running FCI, who is also a fabulous individual as part of a private equity sale, that was natural that he would be moving on and we were very happy that the whole current management team who now reports to the gentleman who is running that as part of Amphenol. They are very strong robust and excited to be part of the team. And they are doing that under the leadership of someone who has gone through this exact same transformation in a very, very successful fashion in years past. So otherwise, we are not mushing things together. We are not going through radical transformations. But we are doing the things that are necessary from an operating standpoint as Craig alluded to, to get the margins up. And long-term, in Amphenol, it\u2019s not like we have sacred cows and we say nothing can go, we are going to be very thoughtful about that. But at the end of the day, we feel that that is an enterprise that is going to be a high performance enterprise going forward. Adam Norwitt : Very good. I think that is our final question. So on behalf of Craig and I we again wish you all happy New Year. Hope that everybody enjoys the current market environment and we certainly look forward to talking to you all again here in 90 days and best wishes for a strong start to the New Year. Appreciate it. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Q1 results were released this morning. And I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter; and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A. The company closed the first quarter with sales and EPS of $1.451 billion and $0.59, excluding one-time items. Sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currencies, sales in the first quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially, sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and down 8% organically after a seasonally stronger fourth quarter. Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprises 6% of our sales, was down 1% from last year primarily due to the effective currency translation. The Interconnect business, which comprises 94% of our sales, was up 10% from last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisition. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income, excluding one-time items, increased to $270 million in the first quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 18.6%, compared to 19.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The decline in operating margin is due primarily to the lower profitability level of the FCI business acquired in early January. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis, but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and expect their operating income margins to improve over time, based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.3%, compared to 12.1% last year. The increase in margins related primarily due to strong operating execution and some favorable impact from commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 20.6%, compared to 21.8% last year due to the acquisition of FCI. We are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving an enhanced performance. The company has recorded one-time charges of approximately $30 million or $0.09 per share during the first quarter related to the FCI acquisition, which closed in January. These include the acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog and post-closing restructuring charges. The acquisition-related transaction costs includes professional fees, transaction taxes and other external transaction-related costs. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million, compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's effective interest rate was 26.5% both in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, excluding one-time items. On an as reported basis, the company's effective tax rate was 28.7% and 26.5% for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income, excluding one-time items, was a strong 13% of sales in the first quarter of 2016, although it was impacted, as previously discussed, from the acquisition of FCI. EPS was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2016, excluding one-time items. And on an as reported basis, EPS was $0.50 and $0.57 for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1.479 billion, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to l. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $194 million in the first quarter or approximately 123% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $934 million at the end of March; and inventory days were 84 days, up five days compared to December and within the normal range for the first quarter. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.2 billion at the end of March; and day\u2019s sales outstanding was 75 days, up approximately four days from December and within the normal range. Accounts payable was $615 million at the end of March; and payable days were 55 days, up one day compared to December. The cash flow from operations of $194 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $53 million and stock option proceeds of $19 million, were used primarily to fund acquisitions of $1.2 billion; to purchase approximately $49 million of the company's stock; to fund net capital expenditures of $38 million; and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion net of translation. As we've mentioned previously, the purchase price for FCI was funded entirely with offshore cash. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares under its January 2015 10 million share stocks repurchase program. 4.5 million shares remain available under the program through January 2017. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $714 million, the majority of which was held outside the U.S. On March 1, 2016, the company entered into a new $2 billion senior revolving credit facility, which replaced the previous $1.5 billion facility. At quarter end, the company had issued $877 million under its commercial paper program; and effective April 1, the commercial paper program was also increased from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities now total approximately $1.8 billion. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In Q1 2016, EBITDA was approximately $312 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. And Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I'd like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone here today from sunny Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our first quarter achievements here. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter, as well as for the full year; and then of course there'll be time for questions at the end. With respect to the first quarter, we're very pleased that our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high-end of our guidance in sales and earnings; and that's despite continued market uncertainty. Our revenues increased by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $1.451 billion. And very importantly, the company booked a new record of $1.479 billion in orders, which represented a book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1. As Craig went through and as we had anticipated, our margins, after acquisition-related expenses, were lower than prior year due to the impact of FCI, but reached to higher than expected 18.6% operating margins. And operating cash flow in the quarter was again a very strong $194 million. And I just have to say once again, how proud I am of this entrepreneurial Amphenol team who once again has reconfirmed the value of both their discipline, as well as their very important agility; and that has driven strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties in the worldwide economy. Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just point out that once again in the quarter, we continue to have a real tremendous balance across our end market diversification, as no one of our markets represented more than 19% of our sales in the first quarter; and that's after including FCI, which we acquired at the beginning of the quarter. Turning first to the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and in local currencies from prior year, as growth in avionics, airframe and ordinance was offset by moderated sales to communications and vehicle applications. And sequentially, our sales were down slightly from the fourth quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we were instructed by the United States Defense Logistics Agency, or the DLA, to stop the shipment of several of our military specification connector products that are sold by one of our operations into the U.S. military market. This was due to the sourcing of certain non-critical piece parts from non-approved locations including China, as well as delays in regular product testing. I'd just say that we understand that there are no alleged quality issues with respect to these products; and I'd also just reaffirm that our practices, we believe, are common in the industry and thus we have expressed disagreement with the delays strict to rule interpretation. Nevertheless, we have complied with the DLAs order and we're currently executing on a plan to meet their requirement, which we expect to be completed within the next two quarters at the latest. Let me just also note that the specific products that are impacted represent less than 10% of our annual military sales. Despite the short-term regulatory challenge, our team continues to do an excellent job of strengthening Amphenol's overall position in the military market. And looking ahead, while we expect sales in the second quarter to moderate slightly from these levels due to this delay issue, we do continue to expect growth in the low-single digits for the full year of 2016. Amphenol remains the leader in the military interconnect industry with the broadest range of products across virtually all defense equipment; and this is a position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter; and sales in this market were up slightly from prior year, as stronger sales onto new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet sales. Sequentially, our sales were a bit softer than expected as they were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, while we expect a slight moderation of sales in the second quarter, we continue to expect growth for the full year of 2016, as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. And I can just reaffirm that we are very pleased with our strong position in the commercial air market. And we continue to take excellent advantage of the proliferation of new electronics on next-generation commercial aircraft, which we're enabling with our broadened range of high-technology interconnect products. The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition, together with growth in the hybrid bus and truck, instrumentation, medical and alternative energy segments. Organically, sales were essentially flat as growth in those segments was offset by continued significant declines in several markets, including oil and gas in particular. Sequentially, our sales grew by 9% largely due to the benefits of FCI. For the second quarter, we anticipate sales to increase moderately from these current levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year, as we benefit from the contributions of FCI together with organic growth from a range of segments across the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business and we continue to make progress in selling an ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this exciting market. In particular, I would just commend our team, who has done an outstanding job of continuing to unearth growth opportunities amidst the backdrop of what is clearly a more somber global industrial market outlook. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter; and sales increased a strong 11% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 6% organically. And this was driven by expanded sales of our products used in a wide array of new vehicle electronics, as well as growth in hybrid electric vehicles in which we have strong content. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%. We continue to have a positive outlook for the automotive market, as we drive a broadened range of interconnect and sensor products across a more diversified array of vehicles and onboard electronics around the world, all while at the same time continuing to identify and leverage complementary high-technology acquisitions. We look forward to realizing the benefits from this approach for many, many years to come. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to again increase from these levels; and for the full year of 2016, we remain confident to achieve strong growth in the automotive market. The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the first quarter, our sales were down by 6% from prior year and just over 30% from the fourth quarter. Just once again, our team demonstrated incredible agility in this quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the face of the significant sequential reduction, all while staying poised to capitalize on any opportunities for incremental sales that may become available in the market. We're very confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the dynamic mobile devices market; and we are encouraged by our excellent technology positions across a wide range of new mobile computing platforms. While we do expect sales in the second quarter to increase sequentially by at least 20%, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit decline in our sales for the full year of 2016. Regardless of this more muted outlook for the full year, we remain extremely confident that our team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may arise in this exciting market. The mobile network represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. And sales were better than expected in the first quarter, growing from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, as we benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales in particular to network operators across several geographies. Sequentially, we grew by 22% from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the addition of FCI. We're very pleased in the first quarter to have achieved renewed organic growth in the mobile networks market; and I think that this is a strong reflection of the company's ongoing efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers, as well as equipment makers around the world. Those customers continue to drive their networks to higher levels of performance, as mobile users, the end users, ultimately demand ever greater bandwidth and more comprehensive coverage. Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to remain essentially at these first quarter levels. And while we continue to expect strong full year growth with the addition of FCI, we think it remains still too early to predict organic growth for the mobile networks market for the full year of 2016. Regardless, we remain well-positioned to capitalize on any growth opportunity that should arise in this market. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were up strongly from prior year and prior quarter, as contributions from FCI offset some organic moderation in sales. Our sales overall were up 21% versus prior year. With the broadened technology offering and expanded reach into customers that we have gained with the FCI acquisition, we continue to make excellent progress in our development of advanced high-technology products, as well as in our penetration of the many newly arising web service and data center customers. In particular, we're helping both these new customers as well as our traditional customers in their drive to raise the levels of performance of their equipment to support ongoing and dramatic increases in data traffic. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year of 2016 with the contributions from FCI. The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies, as multiservice operators, in particular in North America, began to expand their purchasing volumes. Our sales grew by 4% sequentially. While we were very pleased to see these early signs of renewed growth in the broadband market and while we do expect a slight increase from these levels in the second quarter, we continue to believe that the broadband market in 2016 will remain at roughly last year's levels. Nevertheless, as the industry eventually digests the many corporate consolidations that are ongoing, we are well positioned with our expanded range of Interconnect and Cable products to capitalize on any growth opportunities that may emerge. So, just in summary with respect to the first quarter, I just want to tell you how proud I am of the company's strong start to 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well both organically and through our acquisition program in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. The company's superior results are a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse range of markets, our worldwide presence, a lien and flexible cost structure and most importantly our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to the outlook for the second quarter and the full year, based on a continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and the full-year 2016 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.535 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.64 respectively. This represents the sales and EPS increase, excluding one-time items, versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 7% to 10% respectively. For the full-year 2016, we now anticipate sales in the range of $6.080 billion to $6.200 billion and earnings per share, excluding one-time items, in the range of $2.56 to $2.62 respectively. For the full year, this now represents sales and EPS growth excluding one-time items of 9% to 11% and 5% to 8% respectively over 2015 levels. We're very encouraged by the company's robust start to 2016. And we all look forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the global economy. I'm confident in the ability of our standing management team to build upon that strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities both to grow our market position and to expand our profitability throughout 2016. Operator, at that point, we'd be happy to take any questions if there maybe. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Adam, on the DLA issue, can you perhaps help us think to what percentage of the bill of material is subject to these procurement restrictions? And logistically, does this sort of, in the long run, affect the way you're going to have to source and where you're going to manufacture? Does it affect your cost structure at all, or do you view this just as a transitory thing within a couple of quarters where you overcome these supply chain issues? And I have a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. I think with respect to, the first part of your question, as it relates to the bill of materials, I don't know whether you mean the bill of materials in terms of our product range or what do we represent on the bill of materials of our customers. So, maybe I'll answer both. On one, I would just tell you that connectors represent a small percentage of the overall bill of materials, but we're the largest connector manufacturer in the defense industry. So, we have a very, very broad presence across essentially every equipment that there is. As it relates to our products, I think I mentioned that the products that issued here; number one, they come from one facility; and number two, they represent less than 10% of our overall military sales. So, from that perspective, it is a relatively minor impact to the overall military business that we have even if one or two of those products can end up on lots of different systems around the world. We do believe this will be a transitory issue. Let me just say that very clearly. We're working very rapidly to address the demands of the DLA. And our team is well, well along in that process. And as I mentioned, we expect this at most to be a two-quarter disruption at the extent that it is. Will it mean that we will have to source certain things in certain different places? Absolutely, because ultimately part of the issue arose from sourcing of components in a place that they now have decided is not appropriate to source from. So, we have already resourced those products. And I can tell you today that the vast majority of what we need to resource has already been resourced. And ultimately, I can tell you that our company is very good at managing through any cost impact that would come from that. We don't expect any material changes to our profitability in that business long-term. Wamsi Mohan : All right. Great. Thanks, Adam. I appreciate the detail. And as a follow-up, on the mobile devices, you noted, if I heard you right, 20% quarter-on-quarter increase. I know obviously like 1Q was a fairly tough quarter across the entire mobile supply chain. It seems as though your 2Q quarter-on-quarter increase is actually somewhat better than what a lot in the industry are witnessing. And I was wondering if you could share any color on what is driving that sequential growth here from somewhat low levels arguably in 1Q? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, no, I appreciate that. Look, I think the first quarter, we view that as a normal quarter. I mean the reality is, if you look at our results over many years, the first quarter is usually down somewhere between, I don't know, 20%, 35%. So, was this slightly the high end of that? Maybe, but it was not out of the ordinary as far as we're concerned. That is what it is usually in the first quarter. I can't comment on what others are seeing in the second quarter. I can only comment on the fact that our team continues to do a wonderful job to take advantage of every opportunities that is present in the market, whether that is on new programs, taking share on other programs, developing new products, expanding the range of products that we sell, expanding the range of customers to whom we sell those products, and the different types of platforms that are there, because you're dealing with platforms everything within mobile computing devices that can be tablet, computers, that can be laptops, that can be phones, that can be accessories, wearables, all those kind of things. And I think our team does a fabulous job of continuing to diversify their business, expand and deepen their presence with customers and ultimately that's what we see going to the second quarter with the robust sequential outlook that we have. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open. James Suva : Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team there at Amphenol. I think most are aware of your very good acquisition strategy and how strong it's been. And with interest rates so low, can you talk a little bit about your comfort level for continuing to do acquisitions or maybe are there debt to capital or debt to EBITDA levels or something you're mindful of, or it seems like the cash flow generated nature of this industry really supports a meaningful still room for M&A. So, can you talk about sometimes we get pushback about, oh, the company can't lever up any more or things like that, but can you just kind of talk about where your comfort level is from a financing perspective? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I'll let Craig talk first about the capital structure in the company, and then I'll maybe make a few more comments. Craig Lampo : Sure. So, Jim, at the end of the quarter, we had about $1.8 billion of capacity under our revolver and cash from availability perspective after we did the new revolving credit facility that we entered in the first quarter that I mentioned in my comments, which certainly we believe is very strong capacity and certainly does even take into account the strong operating cash flow that the company continues to generate. From a pro forma leverage perspective, we're approximately 1.5 times at the end of the quarter, which is certainly well within our comfort level, certainly giving full on the appropriate consideration to the importance of our investment grade rating. So, I would say that we're very comfortable and certainly have sufficient flexibility from a leverage standpoint, and believe that we have plenty of capacity for future acquisitions as well as any stock repurchases that may be warranted. Adam Norwitt : And I think that's a very important backdrop, which is, we continued to be a very aggressive acquirer in the industry. We have a lot of capacity. We made just, at the beginning of the year, closed the largest acquisition in our history. Last year, we completed three other acquisitions and we continue to have a strong pipeline. At the same time, we will always be a disciplined acquirer. So, we look for companies that have great people that have great technology, that have a strongly complementary market position. And then we look to pay fair prices for those companies. And the fact that interest rates are low or not low, doesn't necessarily enter into our calculus so much in terms of the price we're willing to pay on things and how much of our capital we're willing to put to work. We view acquisitions as a very, very long-term initiative. This is not a short-term approach to say, well, that can be accretive in the year and thus we will do the acquisition. We're very, very thoughtful about that. And thus, we spend a lot of time. We date many, many, many companies over time. And then eventually, the select few of those that we date ultimately become strong acquisitions for the company. And we will continue to follow that same approach regardless of what short-term interest rates do or what the overall market multiples will do. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks. Adam, it sounded from your commentary that the macro continued to be challenging and looking at the guidance for the full year for many of your segments, the growth seems to be somewhat challenged. I guess I'm trying to think about the outlook with the FCI business obviously in there. How should we think about organic growth for you guys this year? It seems like it maybe low single-digits. And how should we think about the connector industry market growth at this point? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Sherri. I think we don't have a different view about our organic growth this year than we did when we came into the year. And I think at the time we talked about the organic growth being kind of at the midpoint just a hair above flat. And I think at the high point it was somewhere between flat, I think, down to the up 1% or something in that range. And we don't have a different view about the \u2013 or down 1% to up 2% I guess it was. We don't have a different view about the organic growth of the company this year. Now, when you look at the different markets, it's not that every market has that somber outlook. And I think this really speaks to the value of the diversification in the company. We have one market, mobile devices, which is not a small market for us. Last year in particular, it was a significant 18%, 19% of sales market and we do expect that that market will be down in the coming year, and that's all organic. On the other side, we have a positive organic outlook for markets like automotive, industrial. We have a positive outlook for aeros for commercial aviation and others are more flat. So, I think the value of the diversification in a time like this where there is no question that the overall growth environment is more muted is really coming through in 2016. What does that mean in terms of the overall growth of the Interconnect industry? There are many studies about that. I think when you compare us to others, you see still a more favorable outlook and a more favorable ultimately results in terms of the organic growth compared to the overall industry. And our goal, as a company, continues to be to outgrow the industry in every environment and through every cycle. And if you look over the course of the last 10 years, 15 years, we have outgrown the industry by a significant margin and we still have a long-term conviction to continue to do that going forward. Sherri Scribner : That's helpful. Thanks, Adam. And then just thinking about the margin profile as we move forward with FCI. Is there a point when you think that FCI's business can get to your corporate average levels and how long does that take? Thanks. Craig Lampo : Yeah. I think, Sherri, what I would say on that is that we've taken some great actions I think in the first quarter that provide a real solid foundation for future performance for FCI. I mean, as a management team, we continue to be committed to improving that overall profitability of FCI. And I'm confident over time that we will be successful on bringing up to that pre-acquisition average for the company. I would say in regards to our full year guidance, it's only been three months since we acquired the company. And certainly it takes some time to see the impact of these actions. So, I would say that our current guidance really isn't so different than what we guided to in January of the top line and bottom line perspective. But I think, over time, we are committed to getting them. I wouldn't necessarily give you a specific timeframe for doing that, but I think if you look at our history and our success at prior acquisitions, I think you can feel confident as we do that we will be successful in doing that over some period of time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Hi. Afternoon, everybody. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Shawn Harrison : Adam, I guess the mobile infrastructure market, you cited a better start to the year than maybe previously anticipated, but then echoing some caution about the year getting better. And so, maybe if you could just characterize what you're seeing out there? Is there something regionally that's giving you pause or is it just, let's wait and see how the June quarter plays out before getting a little bit more bullish on that market? Adam Norwitt : Well, Shawn, as you know, one swallow does not make a summer. And I think this is a market which had a very challenging year last year. There is still volatility in the market, there's still a lot going on from a corporate perspective in that space. We had a great quarter in the first quarter, and it was better than we had expected. There's no question about that. But I think it's a little too early to say that that is going to be then a trend of growth in the year. Should the opportunity present itself to have that growth in the year, our organization is so well positioned. And the one thing that we felt very good about in the first quarter is that the growth, that did not just come out of one place. We saw strength in North America. We saw strength in some places even like in India. We saw some strength in Europe. We didn't see so much strength in Asia in the quarter. And I would say that we probably saw more strength coming out of our sales of our product direct to service providers as opposed to the equipment manufacturers. And you know that there have been many widely reported corporate combinations among the OEMs in that space. So, there's still a lot going on in the industry that makes one take maybe a more prudent outlook for such a market, but to the extent that there is spending that is going to be there, there's no question in my mind that we will capture more than our fair share of it. Shawn Harrison : That's helpful. And as a follow up just on mobile devices, it's tough to actually say what seasonality is in the back half given its varied significantly for you over the past couple of years. But, at least with a strong second quarter, it implies a muted ramp into the back half versus maybe what you saw last year even a few years before. Are you seeing a shift in terms of how that market is ramping or are you just taking a more cautious view on what those devices will grow overall for the year? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. No, look, I think, we still have an outlook for second half to be much stronger than the first half, but you're correct in your calculation that it would be a lower ramp. Last year, our second half sales in mobile devices were, I think, 40%, 45% compared to the first half. And I think our guidance here would imply something more into the mid to high 20%s. So, no doubt about it. Now, in a given year, is there some years where it's more like this year and some years more like last year, I think we've seen all those different scenarios over time. I think that the growth that we're seeing in the second quarter, maybe that's a little more than we would normally see in the second quarter and maybe the second half is a hair less than we would see in other years. And so maybe that's a little bit more in balance from that perspective. But I can tell you that we do always take a prudent approach to our outlook in this market. These are products that sometimes have lifecycles of less than a quarter. And so, we want to be very careful in terms of representing what our customers tell us while also taking some of our past experience in terms of how those ramp ups ultimately go and that's how we craft the guidance. I think what everybody knows, who's followed the company for a long time, is to the extent that opportunities do arise either a competitor falls down on the job or a customer sells more of their products, our team has always been impeccably able to capitalize on those opportunities. And we'll, no doubt, be in that same position this year should those opportunities arise. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up as well. I guess, Adam, when you think about the stop shipment impact from the DLA, do we think about this 1% revenue, $10 million, $11 million a quarter call it, essentially seizing in June and September, and then you're having a potentially snap up effect in the December quarter. Is that the way to think about it? Is that sort of what you baked into your model, and do you run a risk of share loss in this market given the fact that it's going to take two quarters to resolve it? Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Amit. I think that I would not anticipate any material snap back in the fourth quarter. I think the thing is still playing out. We are just over 30 days or so into this wonderful experience with the DLA. But no doubt about it, our team will be poised as soon as we are off that stop ship to satisfy every one of our customers as much as they need to be, but I wouldn't necessarily assume some massive snap back. Look, relative to share, in the next two quarters are some people going to take some orders that otherwise we would have taken, I guess by definition that's the case. But I can tell you, as a company who has been through two floods and this is the same facility, which was having a flood in the past, and by the way, I could tell you that these issues relate back even to the time of the flood, but that's not for regulators to sympathize with. I can tell you that this is an organization who does not accept to lose a position, period. And with our breadth of technologies, with our program presence, a two quarter stop shipment is not going to hurt Amphenol in the medium-term or long-term in our market position. In fact, I can tell you, we're going to come back so much stronger after this, that I would expect over the long-term, we will further build our leadership position in the military market. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. That's very helpful. And I guess, Adam, I heard you guys talk about the M&A discussion with Jim. I'm curious, you guys have plenty of liquidity as you sit today, what drove the decision to expand the commercial paper program, increase your revolver further at this point, given the fact you have enough liquidity and it doesn't seem like M&A is any more eminent today than it's ever been in the history of the company? Craig Lampo : Sure. I think I'll take that one, Amit. I think the reasoning for that is really just more based on the size of the company today. We thought it was very prudent to increase the capacity of the company. We're a much bigger company than we were when we initially entered into the credit facility at the $1.5 billion size. We want to \u2013 we use most of our cash from a domestic perspective. We use for our share repurchase and dividend programs so domestically, we generally use our facilities for that in addition to any M&A that may come along. So there wasn't any other reason other than just to increase our capacity, and given the size of the company, so to put us in a better position long-term, but I wouldn't read so much into that. In regards to our overall capacity, again, this $1.8 billion that I mentioned before, which includes the $1.1 billion of availability at the end of the quarter under our credit facility and then the additional $700 million of cash that we had on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones for me, Adam. Just regarding the auto business, it sounds like the momentum is continuing there, you talked about good growth rates for the year. Within that business, the heavy truck and off-road vehicle area, I know has been mixed too weak for other suppliers and I know that tends to be a good margin business relative to the rest of your auto. How are things tracking there and what's the outlook versus geographies for that business? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, first, I would just make one clarification which is, we don't classify heavy truck as part of our automotive business, that's part of our industrial business. Matthew Sheerin : Got it. Okay. Adam Norwitt : I certainly wouldn't assume that our margins are different on a heavy truck than it would be on overall automotive. So automotive is for us really automotive, as it is called. No, we're so happy with the automotive business. And you've followed us long enough to have seen the trajectory of that business over the last six years, seven years going from I think at its low 0.56% of sales to today 19% of sales, and we've done that both through some wonderful acquisitions together with some just outstanding technology program wins that we've had over those many years. And where we used to be a safety device company with a little bit of telematics, today, we have a very broad high-technology automotive offering, ranging everything from engine control to antilock braking, to electronic transmission, to high-voltage products, into sensors, starting even to make penetration and things like antennas along with the RF products that we've sold for so many years, and together with hybrid and electric vehicles. And so that breadth that we have into the high-growth content opportunities in the car that has really been for us what has differentiated in terms of our performance. And geographically, our automotive business has also really transformed from a predominant kind of two-thirds European business to today, a less than half of the business in Europe and really equally spread on the rest between North America and Asia. And when we look at our results in the last quarter, actually, we had really strong performance. For example, in the first quarter coming out of in Asia where there was some talk last year at least in terms of some warning signs in that space. But our team in Asia has just done a fantastic job and we've made a nice acquisition as well last year that positioned us with some of the local manufacturers in Asia. So I'd just tell you, we continue to grow in our satisfaction with the breadth and the depth of our automotive business. We're still small on any relative and comparable basis, but we certainly are getting more and more than our fair share as things go on. Matthew Sheerin : Got it. And just another question on FCI, it looks like the results there came in to plan, but there was a disproportionately higher percentage of distribution sales for FCI than there is I know for Amphenol. And there has been talk among other suppliers, particularly the semi-suppliers that inventory correction has largely played out in distribution, there is some refresh going on. Are there signs from FCI's perspective that that's happening? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I would just tell you that FCI didn't necessarily see a meaningful inventory \u2013 maybe at the time that everybody else was talking about it. And not surprisingly, they don't see necessarily a correction or a refresh that comes sometimes on the tail of that. So we don't see anything meaningful plus or minus relative to changes in the distribution channel. What we do see and that's for sure is now having owned FCI for just over three months, the relationships, the presence, the discussions that we're having with the distributors have really gone to a next level. And I think that that is just the testament to the strength that FCI had. You correctly point out, roughly 40% of their sales was on distribution, but what's more important is not that 40%, but rather where that 40% resides with the distributors. We have traditionally been more in the industrial, the aerospace, the harsh environment products with those distributors and FCI takes us much more into the more commercial products, a lot of which end up in embedded computing applications in the industrial space. And I think that's an area really of excitement among all of our distributors. And so we go from maybe a more traditional position with them to a position that is really right in the wheelhouse of many of their strategies. And I think we really see already the benefits of that in terms of the dialogs that we have had with our distributors and that we continue to have with them. So we thought all along that FCI would be a great asset as it relates to our distribution channel and I can just tell you three months in that that has been clearly confirmed for me. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. Questions on the industrial segment. Adam in your prepared remarks you talked about some varied transmission, different portions of industrial. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on some of those subsector trends within industrial that you're seeing. And if you could help us reconcile at all some of the differences in indicators we see, there has been some improvement in some of the indices like the ISM index has started to pick up, but there is still quite a bit of volatility at a micro level on the industrial \u2013 from the industrial companies. So any sort of granularity or color you could give us on industrial would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. No. Thank you very much, Mark. Look, I mean, we are not too wedded to all of these micro indicators in the industrial market. I mean, I read the same papers and see some of these things. I think there is no question. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that that is a relative somber overall industrial market. That being said, I can tell you our industrial team is far from somber. And I think the reason is, is we continue to plum for those opportunities that are there. We are not just stuck to things that aren't growing. But as soon as we see that the opportunity is not there, our team is quickly pivoting towards those areas where there are opportunities. And so we talked about last quarter, one example where we've seen a really great growth out of something like a hybrid bus and truck. We've seen also great growth coming out of alternative energy in areas like new lighting applications. We saw strength in instrumentation in the quarter. Conversely, a market like an oil and gas continues to not be a great place to be and that is what it is. And our team who is involved in oil and gas is doing all the things that you would expect and Amphenol management team to do at a time when sales are down very significantly. It is just a kind of a microcosm of how we view our business overall within industrial that we drive every day to make sure that we are properly diversified and agile such that we can pivot towards the opportunities that are there in the industrial market. And I think, our team has shown consistently the ability to really fair it out those growth opportunities, wherever they may be. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. A follow-up question on commodities, there's been some rebound in commodity prices, especially in gold. And can you just talk about to what extent you are starting to see that in your cost structure and if there is something we need to be keeping in mind, as we think about modeling costs going forward? Craig Lampo : Yeah, I mean, I'll take that. Thanks. Yeah, a good question. I think that as we've said before, there is certainly many contributors to margin. And in terms of the rebound of gold or copper or the other commodities, we've always said that you kind of have to look at the top-line growth opportunities in terms of the marketplace versus the bottom-line from the commodities and other things. And we haven't seen really a significant \u2013 although certainly a positive commodity environment is helpful, but we haven't seen that significant improvement other than in the cable segment, which I talked about a little bit. I wouldn't say that we would \u2013 I would say that there is a \u2013 we would also see a negative trend right now, based on where the prices are. Certainly if the markets then overall, become more robust in the future and like in 2011 when the commodities had some significant increase, there could be some impact at that point, but we don't see that at this point in time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood from Macquarie Capital. Your line is now open. Mike Wood : Hi. Good afternoon. Auto remains one of your strong growth markets, curious if you can give us some more color just in terms of what's actually been driving the content and based on your platform visibility, where you see some of the content, if there is maybe one or two areas that you could point to of strong growth there? Adam Norwitt : Well, good afternoon, Mike. I think I mentioned earlier that we have really broadened our automotive business and we broadened it both from an application, we've broadened it geographically, we've broadened it by customer. I wouldn't point to just one or another application. I mentioned earlier that we've seen solid growth coming out of hybrid electric vehicles. Look, hybrid electric vehicles has been something that people have been talking about for pretty close to a decade now and I would tell you that today that seems to be a bit more of a reality than it was earlier just the prognosis for hybrid electric vehicles. So we're happy to see that, we're happy to see that we continue to win and gain new content. We've seen a lot of great content in other areas like electronic transmissions for example, that's something I've talked about in the past. It's an area where customers have one of the harshest environment electronic systems in the car, and where there is a unique interconnect requirement, in a very inhospitable part of the car, which is ultimately transmission. And it's part of a category of applications that I would almost refer to as halfway to hybrid because that's one area, whether that's electronic transmissions, whether that's start-stop motors, whether that's engine management control. These are all areas which allow automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of the car without having to stick a heavy battery and add all of the cost of a hybrid drive into the car. And so I think in general that is one area that's sort of hybrid-ish or half-hybrid area that we have seen good growth and we continue to see good progress with our customers. Mike Wood : Great. And also can you talk about how you view the diversity target to the company with the acquisition strategy? In terms of having now multiple segments that are approaching 20%, is there a sort of number cut-off where you'd exclude large acquisitions from your pipeline just to maintain the diversity? Adam Norwitt : Look, we believe that the diversity of the company is a great asset for Amphenol and I think we see it here in the first quarter. We've seen it over recent years, and I think this is really a strategy that is from my perspective really without reproach. Today, we have an outstanding balance across our \u2013 across the various markets with two markets representing 19% of sales, one representing 18%, and a few others in the double-digits. And I think that balance is really a great asset for the company. But we have had in the past in a given quarter, even in given year, markets be higher than 20% even up in to the mid-20%s, even flirting maybe close to 30%. Is there a bright line that we would have? I wouldn't tell you that there is a bright line, but I would tell you that there are areas \u2013 there are levels where we would not be comfortable and I think that would really mean that one market would have a disproportionate impact on the company. Is that 35%, is that 40%, is that 30%? I mean I think it's hard to pin a number on to it. But I would definitely know it when I saw it. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question from me, please. Just getting back to the FCI acquisition, you mentioned how you're getting a handle on the distribution strength of the business. My understanding is \u2013 are there sort of product synergies whether its backplane connectors with some of the stuff you do in datacom et cetera. So I was wondering Adam, if you could just talk a little bit about \u2013 I'm sure you're not including sales synergies in your guidance, but the potential for that to ramp and what kind of rough timeline before you could pull some of those synergies together and we could see that in the top-line numbers? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Steve. Look, we are just owning the company now for one quarter. We're very, very pleased with the results here in the first quarter, and I can tell you that there is a lot of activities ongoing across the company. Some of those activities and Craig alluded to them are to get the cost structure in order, and we had significant actions here in the first quarter to do so. But there is other activities, which is to really identify collaborative opportunities for growth. And those collaborative opportunities fall into a few different categories. One is from a market standpoint, working with customers where we may have a strength with a certain customer in a certain geography and FCI may not or vice-versa. Another may be just into a new market. For example, taking FCI's embedded computing products and seeking to proliferate those into an area like an aerospace, for example, where they didn't have so much presence in the past. And a third and equally important area is that technology collaboration. And what I can just tell you is here in the first 90-100 days, we have really attacked all of those areas in a very thoughtful way, because at the same time, as you want to be impatient, as you want to get all that stuff done, you have an organization of 7,000 people who have a new family and they need to adjust to that new family. And we're very thoughtful about how we do that, how we bring the people in, what we ask of them, what we drive them. I mean this is not an easy process for someone coming into a company. But the initiatives that we have already, we start to already see the prospect of value creating between us on those incremental initiatives. When are they going to result in extra sales per se, I think it's too early to pin that on to a day, to a quarter or an outlook. But there is no doubt in my mind that long-term, we will have significant opportunities to realize incremental growth because of those very strong initiatives that are really being embraced across the company. Steven Fox : Great. I appreciate the color. Good luck. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open. Brian White : Yeah. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about IT and data and how you're thinking about the second half of the year. I wasn't clear, are we expecting organic growth in that area? And second part would be China communications infrastructure, what are you seeing in the comm infrastructure market in China? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Brian. Relative to IT-datacom, I think when I talked about our guidance both at the beginning of the year, as well as just now, we did talk about the fact that while we expect a very strong growth because of FCI, we do expect the market overall on an organic basis to be roughly at the same levels of last year. Now, that does incorporate in the second half some growth compared to the first half. And that's not abnormal in the IT-datacom market and that is really organically growing from the first half to the second half of the year. And we look forward to that and we feel that that is not only normal, but it is something that should happen, given our real strength with customers. I think the overall IT datacom market is a market that is going through a lot of transition right now; and you see that in some of the public releases that already come out. But you see that really in terms of the shift of power in the industry and, something that I've talked about in the past, that shift of power towards the operators, the service providers and a little bit away from some of the traditional OEMs. I can tell you that our team and, in particular, our team as it relates to the acquisition of FCI and the breadth of products that we have from FCI has done an outstanding job of ensuring that we take advantage of that shift, as opposed to get injured by that shift; and we're doing a great job to pivot towards some of those new customers. And so, while our overall outlook for the year for IT datacom is a more muted outlook organically, the strength that we have in that space is going to pay great dividends for us. I mean the reality is, we have a lot of confidence in the importance of that market relative to the interconnect market long-term. This is a market where they're pushing the limits of performance to enable data delivery, whether that be video, voice, or other data forms around the world. The challenges that customers are facing in that space are significant, and many of those bottlenecks reside in interconnect. I can tell you that's a good recipe to have a good business behind it. When we see customers who struggle with performance and when we can go in and solve those performance problems, that's a great long-term place to be; and we believe very strongly in the importance of the IT datacom market. Relative to the communications infrastructure market, specifically in China as you discussed, I think I mentioned that in the first quarter we saw good strength in the mobile infrastructure market, in particular from North America and Europe and we didn't yet see that sort of strength building in Asia. It doesn't mean that it's not going to come. I think it's too early to call this year is Asia going to be a helper or a hurter in the mobile infrastructure market. Right now, we continue to have, what I would call, a more prudent outlook. But there is no doubt about it that the growth of mobile data is happening as well in Asia. And I mentioned in one place in particular, which is India, where we have seen really some beginnings of a build-out and we're capitalizing very well on that. And it won't surprise me if that ultimately spreads to other parts of the region. Brian White : Okay. Great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Great, thanks. Just a follow-up question on automotive, given the increased breadth by geography and following up on your comments of robust growth for 2016. Any differences that you're seeing by geography in terms of the automotive growth? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think \u2013 I mentioned that in the first quarter actually we saw our strongest growth coming out of Asia in the automotive space; and we were really pleased to see that. We saw some growth coming out of North America and some maybe a more muted performance coming out of Europe at least in that quarter. I think one quarter is not always perfectly reflective. I think for the year we continue to see opportunities in all of the geographies in automotive. And it's really great for us, given that we are now a much broader geographical presence in the automotive market; and that is a big change from where we were six years, seven years ago, and we're very pleased to have that position. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then as my follow-up on the sensor market and granted you're a relatively new entrant to the space, but just from what you've seen so far after the first couple of acquisitions. Anything you could distinguish in terms of some of the growth drivers in that for those technologies relative to connectors or \u2013 and even go so far as growth rate opportunities? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Look, we've now been in the sensor market for just over two years. I think it\u2019s two years and a quarter now since we made our first acquisition of GE's Advanced Sensor business. I think originally when we made that acquisition, there was always the question, is sensors naturally a higher growth area than interconnect; and we always said, we certainly don't think it's a lower growth than interconnect. And I haven't changed my opinion. Is it necessarily higher growth than interconnect? I don't think by definition it is. But is it at least as good of an opportunity as the interconnect market? We think, no doubt about it, which makes some sense when you get down to it. Because every time you have a new application for a sensor, and that's whether it's in automotive, or industrial, or in aerospace, ultimately that sensor has got to connect into the system. And so, you may have so many new applications in a plane, or a car, or a train, or a bus. Each time you have that new application, that's going to require then some way to get that signal back into the overall system; and that usually is happening through an interconnect product. And so, the reality is the two are not necessarily disconnected in terms of their trends; and we feel very good about that market. I think as we've now gotten a little bit more mature in our experience in the sensor market, and as we've gotten out with more customers, and as we've learned more about the space, we are really excited to be a part of the sensor industry and to have our presence in the sensor industry. Now, we're still small. There is no question about that. Bigger than we used to be, but smaller than we will be in the future. And I think that we see so many potential growth opportunities in the long-term, either organically or through acquisitions over time. And it is just a really exciting technology space. And it's one that really gets to a lot of the underlying technology trends in the various markets that we serve, whether that's emissions control, or whether that's performance, or autonomous driving, or whether that's more control and more analytics that goes on in industrial equipment. You name it, there is no question about it, sensors have a great future there. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Thanks for all that color. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Craig. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Adam, I was hoping you could spend a minute talking about military end market, ex this DLA issue, and maybe looking towards the back half of this year and into next. There is an expectation among some investors that the sequestration is off, we had the first up DoD budget in maybe seven years. Would Amphenol expect to see an acceleration of growth in this end market? And maybe you can characterize the trends and the projects that are going out in that end market, please? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thank you very much, Will. Look, if we takeaway this issue that we already talked extensively about and you look at our outlook for the market, which is still to have a positive growth in the military market despite that DLA issue, I think you'll get the answer right there to the question, which is that we do have a positive outlook. And I think that positive outlook speaks to the breadth of presence that we have across the military market, whereby we are really participating on essentially every program in those geographies where we're allowed as a U.S. company to participate. And I think whether that is new airplane platforms, whether that's upgrade communication systems, whether that is new avionics and radars, there is definitely growth opportunity that we see starting in this year and long-term. Now, is this a snap back or kind of a spike in growth, I would not advocate taking that view of it. But is there really a kind of maybe a more solid footing under the trends of the military market today than there was a couple of years ago? I feel like there is. And you look at our performance even last year in the military market, where we had relatively flat performance in a market where I think you would have thought was overall down, there's no doubt about it that we continue to grow our position in the military market; and that's despite any of the sort of mild regulatory hiccups that may come our way. So long-term, I think that's a great market to be in. It's a market where we have tremendous presence; and it's a market where there's a lot of innovation around the technologies and around the electronics that are there. We see also in the military market that there is a subtle shift that appears to be happening just more geopolitically; and that subtle shift is that subtle shift away from a more tactical focus, getting a little bit back towards a more strategic focus. And that's a geopolitical topic that you could spend hours to review. But the net-net of that is that when you get to a more strategic priority in military, the answer very often comes down to new technologies and new systems, and what can be done with radars, with surveillance, with new fighter jets, with new avionic systems, with new communication systems. And so, long-term I think that that will be a great place to be. And our position remains very, very strong there, and we look forward to capitalizing on those trends going forward. William Stein : Thanks, Adam. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Will. Well, I think if I understand correctly this was our last question. And I'd like to take the opportunity to wish all of you a very warm and pleasant spring here; and we look forward to speaking to all of you again here in just around 90 days. Thank you very much. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day",

White - Drexel Hamilton LLC Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may now begin. Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo, and I'm Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter conference call. Q2 results were released this morning. I provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we'll take Q&A. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1.548 billion and EPS of $0.65. Sales were up $0.15 \u2013 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 4%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 11% from last year, primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The Interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 15% from last year, primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income increased to $300 million in the second quarter. Operating margin, excluding one-time items, was 19.4% compared to 19.7% at second quarter of 2015. As discussed on our last earnings call, the FCI acquisition is accretive on an earnings per share basis, but reduces the company's overall operating income percentage as the business currently operates at a lower level of profitability than the average of the company. We continue to be very excited about the potential of the FCI acquisition and have begun to see improvement in their operating margins. We expect their operating income margins to continue to improve over time based on the combination of their excellent management team, leading technology and our strong operating discipline. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The increase in margin is related primarily to strong operating execution on additional volume, as well as the benefit from favorable impact of commodities. In the Interconnect segment, margins were 21.2% compared to 21.9% last year. The decline in the Interconnect operating margins reflects the impact of the FCI acquisition previously discussed. We continue to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance, action-oriented culture and which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions, and thereby, is maximized both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million when compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company's stock buyback programs. The company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in both the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2015, excluding one-time items. On a GAAP basis, the company's effective tax rate was 26.5% and 27.1% for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net income was a strong 13% of sales in the second quarter of 2016. EPS was $0.65 and $0.58, excluding one-time items in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively. And on a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.65 and $0.56 for the second quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively. Orders for the quarter were $1.582 billion, a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $243 million in the second quarter or approximately 117% of net income. For the six months, operating cash flow was $438 million or approximately 119% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of June. Inventory days were 79 days, down five days compared to March. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of June; and days sales outstanding was 73 days, down approximately two days from end of March. Accounts payable was $645 million at the end of the quarter; and payable days were 55 days, flat compared to March. The cash flow from operations of $243 million along with stock option proceeds of $66 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $59 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million and to repay commercial paper borrowings of $33 million, which resulted an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $112 million net of translation. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1 million shares. 3.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January 2017. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were $825 million, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued $845 million under its commercial paper program and the company's cash and availability under the credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at June 30. Total debt at June 30 was $2.8 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion. In Q2 2016, EBITDA was approximately $362 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple comments relative to our guidance. We have issued updated guidance in the press release that increases our range of guidance for the full year from sales and diluted EPS excluding one-time items of $6.080 billion to $6.200 billion and $2.56 to $2.62, to sales of $6.120 billion to $6.200 billion, and EPS of $2.60 to $2.64, an increase in the midpoint of guidance of $20 million in sales and $0.03 in diluted EPS. This updated guidance reflects the offsetting impacts of the negative impact of current FX rates, particularly the weakening of the euro, RMB, and pound, and the positive impact of our newly announced acquisitions. In addition, it reflects our current expectations for accretion from our January 2016 acquisition of FCI of $0.15 compared to $0.12 in our previous guidance. Our updated expectations for FCI reflect good progress in operating margin improvement. The management team continues to be fully committed to continuing to improve the FCI margins. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I also like to add my welcome to that of Craig's to all of you who are here on the phone today, and I hope that you've all had a pleasant beginning to the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And in particular, I'll discuss some of the trends and progress in our various end markets. Finally, I'll make a few comments on the outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2016. And of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. With respect to the second quarter, we're just so pleased that we reached new records in sales and orders and equaled our previous record for EPS. I'll just say that these achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Our revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reaching that new record of $1.548 billion. And Craig alluded to the fact that we booked also record orders in the quarter of $1.582 billion and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1. We're also really proud of the company's margins, which increased by 80 basis points from the first quarter to 19.4%. Really excellent achievement, especially in light of the currently lower margins of FCI that Craig detailed. And while those margins do remain below our average, we're excited to be starting to see improvements in the operating performance of FCI and that is reflected in our revised guidance for EPS accretion of approximately $0.15. Operating cash flow in the quarter was also a very robust $243 million, which is a clear sign of the quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say that I remain truly proud of our Amphenol team. Our entrepreneurial agility has once again enabled the company to achieve strong performance despite what are still very significant uncertainties around the worldwide economy. And with respect to that financial strength, we're also very pleased that our financial position has enabled us to complete two acquisitions just in the last week. First, AUXEL FTG is a France-based manufacturer of high-technology power interconnect solutions for both the industrial and IT datacom markets. And AUXEL has sales of approximately $50 million per year. AUXEL, which has facilities in France and Germany as well as production in China and India, is a real leader in value-add power interconnect and busbars and represents an excellent complement to our already broad array of high reliability power interconnect products. Custom Cable, the other acquisition we announced today, is a U.S.-based manufacturer of fiber optic and copper cable assemblies, in particular for the enterprise and carrier datacenter market. And that company has annual sales of approximately $30 million. With Custom Cable's outstanding service and their great product offering, together with our existing array of high technology products, we really look forward to being able to better capitalize on the interconnect opportunity within the fast-growing data center space. Let me just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our successful acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is in fact our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and successfully bring those new companies into the Amphenol family that represents a real core competitive advantage for the company. Turning to our progress across our served markets, I'll just comment that our company's extremely balanced and diversified end-market exposure is really a great asset, in particular during economic times like today. In fact, we're really pleased that in the second quarter not one of our markets represented more than 20% of our overall sales. Starting first with the military market, military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down slightly in U.S. dollars and local currencies from prior year as growth in avionics, airframe and space applications was offset by its slower sales in military vehicles, communications and rotorcraft. Sequentially, the sales were flat from the first quarter. As we've talked about last quarter, we expected and in fact, that's what happened, that our sales were impacted by the Defense Logistics Agency's stop shipment order that we reviewed with you. Our team continues to work on the recovery from the DLA stop ship. And we are actually encouraged by our progress thus far and have actually just recently been able to secure a lifting of the stop ship on certain products. Nevertheless, our expectations for the financial impact of the DLA issue remain consistent with what we discussed last quarter. Despite this continued short-term regulatory challenge, we remain very encouraged by the company's performance in the military market. For the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these current levels and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016, even with the impact from the DLA issue. I'll just tell you that Amphenol remains the leader in military interconnect technology with the broadest range of high technology products across virtually all defense equipment, and that's the position of strength that we look forward to building upon into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market were down by 5% from prior year, as stronger sales on some new airplane platforms were offset by continued reductions in commercial helicopter and business jet-related sales. In addition, we did see in the quarter some impact of the DLA stop shipment on certain military specification products that are used in commercial air applications, and in particular, sell-through distribution. As expected, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter. Looking ahead into the third quarter, we do anticipate a moderate increase in sales sequentially and we continue to expect growth for the full year 2016, as production volumes of new airplane platforms ramp up. The commercial air market is really an exciting space for Amphenol. With our strong technology position with customers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on new aircraft platforms, as well as the increasing production volumes of such airplanes, we are very confident for the long term in this exciting market. The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 19% from prior year, driven by contributions from the FCI acquisition as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, alternative energy, rail mass transit and medical segments. Organically, sales increased by 2% as growth in these segments was offset by declines in our sales to oil and gas and heavy equipment customers. Sequentially, our sales growth is expected by 5% from the first quarter. Now with the acquisition of AUXEL, we have today the broadest range of power interconnect products into the industrial market, including a wide array of value-add solutions for both high and low-voltage applications. For the third quarter, we anticipate sales to remain at these levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and now AUXEL, together with organic growth from a range of segments within the industrial market. We remain very proud of our diversified industrial business as we continue to make progress in selling in ever broader range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products into this important space. And our position in the industrial market is really stronger than ever and that's despite continued uncertainties across the global industrial market. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. And this was driven by continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional as well as hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% in the quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at or slightly above these levels due to normal summer seasonality. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive. With our continued expansion of automotive interconnect sensor and antenna products; we are participating in a very broad range of new vehicle electronic systems. In addition, we now have a more balanced position geographically than actually ever before in the company's history, and this positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities around the world. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that strengthened position from many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up slightly from prior year, as increased sales of products into laptops and accessories were offset by reduced sales into smartphones and tablets. While we grew by a very strong 15% on a sequential basis, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the second quarter. And in fact, we've recently seen a moderation of customer expectations for a range of different mobile devices for the remainder of 2016 and this includes smartphones as well as other mobile computing devices such as tablets and laptops. Accordingly, while we expect sales to increase again in the third quarter by approximately 10% from current levels, we now expect our full year sales to decline by more than from 2015 levels. Regardless of this more challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our dynamic agile team has positioned us to benefit from any increases in demand that may still arise in this very dynamic market. We're confident that our highly reactive organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market and are actually encouraged by our excellent technology positions that are across a wide range of next-generation mobile computing platforms. The mobile networks market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were better than expected in the second quarter, growing from prior year by 29% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, as we benefited from the contributions of FCI, as well as stronger sales of interconnect and antenna products to OEMs and network operators in several geographies. Sequentially, our sales increased modestly from the first quarter. We're very pleased that our growth accelerated here in the second quarter and it's an excellent confirmation of the success of our efforts to expand our position with mobile network service providers and equipment manufacturers around the world. This growth is a great confirmation of our ongoing drive to develop next-generation products that enable the continued proliferation of mobile broadbands. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales on normal seasonality. Nevertheless, we now expect to achieve low- to mid-single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which, together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition, we expect to result in an excellent growth year for mobile networks market. Turning to the information technology and data communications market, this market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in this market was also stronger than expected in the second quarter, as our sales grew 38% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically. This performance was driven by strength in networking as well as further progress that we have made with new data center and web service provider customers. Our sales increased a very robust 12% sequentially, essentially all organic. Our team, focused on the important IT datacom market, is just doing outstanding job of positioning Amphenol across a broad range of customers with the widest array of high technology products, and in particular, with the new products from FCI. We're supporting our traditional and new customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle dramatic increases in data traffic around the world. We're particularly excited that the acquisition of Custom Cable strengthens our position with both enterprise and carrier data centers, and it represents really an excellent addition to our growing offering in this important part of the IT datacom market. In addition, AUXEL further bolsters our leading suite of power interconnect products for the IT datacom market, an increasingly important technology area as data center operators strive for more efficient power consumption for their equipment. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels. And we remain confident in achieving strong double-digit growth for the full year 2016 with the contributions from FCI and these new acquisitions, together with our organic performance. Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we're very pleased that sales increased from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies as cable operators accelerated their investments to accommodate upgrades in network performance. All of this growth was organic. Sales from the first quarter grew by a very robust 11% sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect the seasonal moderation of sales. But nevertheless, given our strong performance here in the first half, we now expect to achieve mid-single-digit growth for the full year 2016 in the broadband market. We're pleased to be benefiting from the renewed investments in next-generation capabilities by cable operators, especially in light of the many challenges we witnessed over the last couple of years amidst the wave of customer merger activity in this market. Our team in the broadband market is now capitalizing on our expanded range of interconnect and cable products, as well as our excellent position with broadband operators around the world and we think this positions us very well for the long term in this important space. So, just in summary, I just can tell you that I'm extremely proud of our company's record results here in the second quarter. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our dual-prong strategy of strategic acquisitions and organic growth, all of which is enabling us to expand our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages : our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a diverse array of end markets, company's worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure, and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. Turning to our outlook, based on the continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year of 2016 the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.543 billion to $1.583 billion, and EPS in the range of $0.67 to $0.69 respectively. This represents sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 3% to 6%. For the full-year 2016, we now expect sales in the range of $6.120 billion to $6.2 billion and EPS, excluding onetime items, in the range of $2.60 to $2.64. For the full year, this represents sales and EPS growth, excluding onetime items, of 10% to 11% and 7% to 9%, respectively, over 2015 levels. We're very encouraged by the company's robust outlook for 2016 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward despite the many ongoing dynamics in the global economy. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our strength and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. With that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Mike Wood from Macquarie Group. Your line is now open. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Congratulations on good quarter results. First question maybe I'll just ask about, your pipeline in automotive, just what you're seeing with some regional color, if you'd expect any impact as the comparisons with the incentives there start to rollover and potentially any European thoughts on production after Brexit? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Mike. Look, our auto business is continuing to just perform extremely well and we're just really happy about the progress that we've made over a many year period. I've talked about it in the past, the strategy that we have of finding complementary acquisitions, together with really driving into new electronics in the car with our organic product suite. And I think that continues to create a very, very strong pipeline. From a regional perspective, what we're just so proud of now is we have transformed that business from what was a clear majority European business with a minority North America and a very small presence in Asia, to now a business that is much, much more balanced. In fact, it's just over 40% or so in Europe and then equally split roughly between the other two regions. And I think that gives us exposure regardless of where the developments are and regardless of where the ultimate volumes are going to be. With respect to the incentives that may be in certain areas, I don't know necessarily that we have seen a big impact or whether we expect to see a big impact from those incentives. The ones that are most widely talked about are in China. They have traditionally to do more with smaller cars that tend to have a little bit less content than maybe some of the larger cars. If I look at our performance in the second quarter, actually, we had our best performance in Europe, where we had strong growth in the European market, both organically as well as with acquisitions. And we had also good performance in Asia and modest, let me say, performance in North America. And again, I think it's a credit to both the OEM diversification that we have, the regional diversification that we now have, and the application diversification, because we're seeing that growth across a wide array of different applications. And that is interconnect and sensors as well. Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And it was good to see the FCI accretion increase. Curious if you've had any conversations yet with the distributors about leveraging the Amphenol product suite with the distributors where FCI had strong relationships and if you have any expectations about that? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We've had a lot of conversations with distributors. I personally have had many of them and our team has had multiples of what I have had. And what we saw early on from the date of announcement and that has continued and I will say even ratcheted up is a great enthusiasm from our distributors on two fronts. Number one is, they have always had an affection, affinity, and loyalty towards FCI, but they had always a little bit of a cloud hanging over it in terms of the prior ownership. Whenever you're owned by a financial sponsor, your partners always have a little bit of a question mark. And I can tell you that every distributor just stood up and applauded when we were ultimately the company that was the ultimate home of FCI. But the second and more important is, FCI has positioned us with those distributors in just a very, very different way than we have been in the past. In the past, we have always been known by the distributors from our original legacy with them, which is in the harsh environment, military, industrial products, and that's where the history came. Even if we have diversified our products over time, we struggled to diversify them in certain of the commercial areas, the more high-tech telecom, IT datacom type areas, which are still very important for those distributors. Well, on the contrary, FCI was extremely well-positioned, and that was the area where they were positioned with these distributors. And so, what we have already seen is really great momentum in elevating the prominence of total Amphenol at those branches where traditionally we were not necessarily the first name to their lips when they were going to their own customers. And I think that elevation of the prominence at those branches which are more associated with telecom, with datacom applications, that will for us create great long-term opportunities to really cross-sell the broader suite of Amphenol products. Does it happen in a six-month period? Not necessarily. But do we already start to see the kind of green shoots of that coming up? We do, indeed. And I can only attest to the level of interaction and the enthusiasm of the interaction that we see with all of our distributors that gives me great confidence that in the future we will really see strong benefits from that combination. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions as well. I guess starting off on the mobile devices side. Adam, could you just talk about the softness that you're seeing in the back half of the year? Is that a reflection of what's happening in the end demand in end markets or is it more a reflection of maybe share shift that's a little bit against you right now and that's impacting you? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, no. Thanks very much, Amit. I think we have seen in the mobile devices, as you know, we came into the second quarter with an expectation of being down for the year in the sort of mid-single digits range and, today, we see that being down somewhere in the 10% range approximately. And that was reflected in part with a somewhat less ramp-up that we saw in the second quarter, we were up about 15%. I think we had originally talked about being up around 20%, and then also some modest reductions here in the second half. We see that really all as changes in the overall demand as it's being now forecast to us from our customers. It's not that we're losing anything of any note. You're always winning and losing certain things in that space, let me say that. But overall, we have seen that just a more modest expectation from customers really across the board from their earlier forecasts. When we look at the mobile device market for the year being down, there's no doubt we prefer it not to be down and we're not happy about that. When you look at the trends, we've had years in the past where the second half is a very significant uptick from the first half and we've had other years where it's a somewhat less significant uptick from the second half. And I think this year in mobile devices, our second half as we've currently guided it is going to be up in somewhere in the teens. And we've had years where it's been in the high-teens, low-20s. We've had other years where it's been like last year much more substantial. And the cadence of the market, do you see more growth in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, we've had even years in the past where the first quarter was not so bad. Every year that changes a little bit. But overall, what we see is a more broad-based reduction in expectations. Now, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is not an easy market to forecast. And our team, no doubt about it, is poised for whatever opportunity to do better than that may come their way. And it's always been the agility of the team that in the end has allowed us to remain strong with our customers. Because in the end, customers want somebody there who can react to those quick changes, satisfy the upticks in demand, and deal with the moderations in demand if they come, and in that market, they tend to come when you least expect them. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Fair enough. That's really helpful. And if I could just follow-up on the FCI integration. I think you guys are raising the accretion by about $0.03 for the full year from $0.12 to $0.15. Just wondering, is that a better demand reflection from FCI or is the margin improvement in FCI much better than what you guys \u2013 or somewhat better than what you guys thought it would be? And to the extent, you can talk about the eventual potential of FCI margins versus what Interconnect average is? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think it's not a demand necessarily. We're happy with the demand. And I would say the demand is really meeting \u2013 the top line of FCI is really, at a minimum, meeting with our expectations. We've just seen better operating performance as a company. We've started to see better operating performance, we expect to see better operating performance and that's what's given us the confidence to raise our outlook for the accretion of the company. We still have a long-term goal, as we always do and as we widely communicated, to have FCI perform at the same levels of the rest of Amphenol. And we certainly don't lose sight of that goal and we have confidence long term to reach that goal. When does it ultimately get there? That's something that is still too early to say, but the early returns and the performance of the team is really fantastic and we're just so pleased with how they have not just embraced being part of Amphenol, but actually embraced what it means to be part of Amphenol. And that high performance culture, they have bought into that, embraced it, and become one with it in a time period that is really somewhat beyond our original expectations. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Just following up on FCI and especially the increased exposure on the IT datacom. There is a lot of changing dynamics to that landscape. So, Adam, we're just hoping you can kind of discuss kind of what they do for you and what you're seeing from kind of a customer traction perspective particularly in the data center? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No, I think it's a really important point, and we talked about the fact that at the time we announced the acquisition that FCI really bolstered our position in the IT datacom market from two perspectives. One, from a product perspective, where they had just a great rounding out of some of our products on the high speed, on the backplane, very incremental progress from a power perspective and IO and then the unbelievable array of board level products that are just really fantastic from FCI. So, from a product technology perspective, we just have today a much, much broader array of products for customers in that space. As it relates to the market side, in addition to the products, we had very complementary customer base in fact. There were certain customers where we were both well-positioned, but there were most customers where one of us had a better position than the other. And whether that was regional where they, for example, had some stronger positions at certain customers for example locally in China, we had maybe certain customers that were a little bit stronger here, they had some very good customers on the data center, the web service provider, we had others, but there wasn't really an overlap there. So, it just \u2013 not just rounded out, but strengthened and bolstered and broadened our position. And you're absolutely correct, the IT datacom market is going through tremendous, tremendous change today and it's not for the faint of heart. You see that around the industry. If you just hang your hat on the traditional OEMs, the traditional places where the orders used to come, the orders then are not going to come at the same pace you used to get them. You've got to pivot. And I think with that broad product range, with the channel, with the presence with other customers, as well as with our innate agility of our team, we've just done a fabulous job in that pivot towards where the opportunity are. I think what's clear is the overall opportunity, the market opportunity for IT datacom is still an exciting one, it's just a very, very different one than it was in the past. If you look at our performance last quarter, we grew 38% together with FCI, but we also grew 5% organically. And clearly, that is a different level of performance than you see overall in the industry and no doubt with the broad range of OEMs in that space. And that growth is a reflection of not just excellent agility that our team has displayed here, now with also a broader range of weapons to attack. So, it's a place that we're excited about. Like any market, I wouldn't want to be 100% in IT datacom, but that's the beauty of the diversification of the company and the diversification even within that space. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for your color there. And then just as a follow-up on kind of the hybrid and EV battery opportunity. There's been some noise of some potential slowing, and I know in these kind of new technologies as they're adopted, it could be kind of fits and starts, as to kind of the growth. But can you just give us a sense in terms of how you see that market developing and have you seen much volatility to that hybrid or EV opportunity? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think in any space, as you correctly point out, as the market is evolving, there is volatility. I think there is actually volatility in most markets, most times right now anyways. We're not in a Steady Eddie kind of a macroeconomy today. And I think the hybrid EV space is no different. There is a tremendous amount of innovation happening and there is a lot of opportunities to intersect new demand for new functionality from customers and it's kind of all over the place. There're so many places where you need to target those customers. And I think it gets down to the nature of our organization. The fact that we have general managers in certain places around the world, whether that's in China, in Europe, in North America, who are focused on their customers reacting quickly to those customers, retooling products, redesigning products, designing new products, as appropriate, that has positioned us well very. I think the other thing that we've seen in this space is there is a real demand for a comprehensive interconnect and sensor solutions. And that's something that our team has started to do a real excellent job on. And will all of those applications that we work on ultimately results in something that is mass produced in volume on a stable fashion for a long time period? No, absolutely not, but well some of them, no question about it. And our approach in times like this in these very dynamic times is to really maximize our presence with as many customers as possible, with as many of our products as possible such that whoever the winners and losers may be as the market shakes out, we're going to be positioned with them. And that's the approach we've followed in the mobile market over many years. That's the approach we followed in the datacom market. And it's an excellent approach here for this exciting space today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You line is now open. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. So, Adam in the mobile device segment, can you comment on that incremental five points of weakness for the year. If you could categorize that between like lower demand on any inventory correction. It sounds as though smartphone demand is pretty weak but PC demand actually was a little bit better in 2Q. Do you think that there was some pull-in, because of that, that's now leading to a little bit sharper decline for the remainder of the year? And I have a follow-up. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, again, what we're talking about here is a reduction in our outlook, not a reduction in the sales. We still expect mobile devices to be up in the second half and up by, as I said, somewhere in the mid-teens range, second half to first half. But it is a reduction in what our customers have been telling us 90 days ago. Is some of that related to inventory build or not? I actually don't have enough visibility into the various pieces of the supply chain to be able to tell you whether there is inventory build. Nothing that we have seen that kind of \u2013 is so obvious. But could there be \u2013 certainly there could be \u2013 but that is not really what we see beyond just hearing from our customers that their overall demand is less than they said it was going to be one quarter ago. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks, Adam. And then have you seen any order pattern changes post Brexit? Has that actually really had an impact, or is it just too early to say anything about it? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't think we've seen any order pattern changes. I think Craig gave a very concise review of some of the FX changes and how those have impacted our overall guidance and that clearly happened on the day after this faithful vote. And I think as Craig mentioned, that had an impact roughly for the full year of somewhere to the tune of $35-million-or-so reduction of our full year outlook. And fortunately we've made these two acquisitions, which essentially offset that in our guidance. But in terms of order patterns or customer conservatism or changes from our customers of any real significance, I don't know that we've seen that. I think there's no question that there's unease around the world even before Brexit, and Brexit does not reduce the amount of money. What does that ultimately translate into, that's hard for us to say at this point. And we'll be watchful of it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Just regarding your commentary, Adam, on the automotive and the fact that you're becoming more geographically diversified there. Could you elaborate that and run by us the numbers percentage by geo and maybe your outlook for each segment? TE Connectivity this morning talked about perhaps slower growth in North America versus perhaps stronger demand in Europe and China. I'm just wondering if you're seeing similar patterns? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think I mentioned earlier that we are very pleased with our balance geographically and that in the last quarter, actually Europe represented just a bit more than 40%, and Asia and North America were roughly balanced on the remainder of that. And I think I also mentioned that Europe was our strongest growing region, followed by Asia and then North America. Matthew Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just the trends in North America in terms of your share and your content growth offsetting perhaps (46:37) share production numbers, are you still confident that you're going to grow here? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think, look, our share overall in the automotive market is still really small. So, while we've grown a lot in the automotive market, we still have a relatively minor position and that's what's so exciting for us, is that there is still so many electronic applications that are coming. And as each new thing comes along, that's a new opportunity for us to create a renewed platform for growth. And I think we see that in North America as much as we see that in Europe and in Asia. As it relates to our performance in North America, related to the SAAR and the overall volumes, we don't have a strong view on what SAAR will be this year and what the impact of that will be on us. I think we expect still to have strong performance in North America for the year. Although I guess at this point, we would expect Europe and Asia to be a bit stronger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question, and congrats on the very strong quarter and good outlook. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm hoping you can talk about the incremental margins going forward \u2013 they were very strong in the quarter. It seems clearly that's going to improving performance within the FCI business and that's expected to extend into September. For how many quarters \u2013 or maybe said another way do you expect that to continue into 2017 to get this sort of upsized contribution margin? Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. I think, as it relates to 2016 and the second quarter, we're really pleased with the company's profitability achievement and we continue to be committed to achieving operating income margin expense and we've really done that in the last couple of years. Moving to 2016, as we've discussed, we've had an overall level of ROS and conversion margin that, although negatively impacted by the inclusion of the FCI that's at the lower \u2013 our company average, from kind of an organic perspective, we've really converted quite well into the second quarter. And certainly part of that strong sequential margin improvement that we've had 30% sequential quarter conversion into the second quarter, 80 basis point improvement, part of that really does relate to our organic business. I'm not going to talk about so much about 2017. We certainly still see improvement potential in the FCI business, and certainly that will happen over time, which essentially equates that happening into 2017. But I think right now, we're really happy with where we are. We performed at a very good level. And going forward I would expect, as you look at our guide for the second half, our conversion will continue into the second half of the year. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. And then a follow-up, if I can, on M&A. Earlier this morning when TE Connectivity announced results, they announced a couple of smaller acquisitions that are frankly a bit more reminiscent of the types of deals Amphenol does. And as a result, it sort of begs the question whether there is incremental competition. I'm aware that these deals are not predictable; you can't certainly predict to close one every quarter for example and that they're subject to all sorts of market and even sometimes family conditions. But when I think of the pace and the pipeline, are you seeing incremental competition for your deals? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, let me just comment. We made and announced two acquisitions this morning, outstanding companies. I discussed both AUXEL and Custom Cable. These are two excellent companies that represent opportunities in very exciting markets for us with really complementary product technology and service offering into those spaces. And together, they represent an annual sales value of about $80 million. And those are just outstanding companies. Are there other companies making acquisitions? I think this is nothing new. Others have made acquisitions of many companies in the past. And whether that's the companies that you follow or otherwise, we're not the only company who has ever made acquisitions in the interconnect market. And we will continue to not be the only company. But what we are is a company who has developed an organic strength in acquisitions that we believe is really second to none. If you look at our track record over a long time period, and we think in acquisitions, in very long time period, if you look at us over a very long time period, we have acquired somewhere north of 60 companies in the last 10, 15 years. Each one of them outstanding companies with great people, great technology and really complementary market position. And we have paid, over time, what we consider to be very fair prices, not that they are low or high, but they are fair prices. In the case of the acquisitions today, for those $80 million in sales, we paid roughly one times sales for those companies. And these are extremely high technology companies that we have brought into the company. And so are we going to win every auction? Are we going to be the first at the door of every company that ever comes out? No. But look, the beauty of the interconnect industry is how rich of an industry it truly is for acquisitions. There is a constant wellspring of new companies that are coming up, smaller companies that are becoming larger and midsize companies that become larger there again. And our approach, both organizationally and also from an execution perspective, is just a really, really, compelling approach for those companies. And the right companies, we're still very, very confident to win those companies and to bring them into the Amphenol family over time. And you correctly point out that every quarter, you cannot predict are you going to get a deal done or not but we have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions and a great reputation among companies in the industry as a place that represents an outstanding ultimate home for those companies long term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Good afternoon, Adam. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Shawn. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Wanted to, I guess, dig in a little bit more to the commentary on mobile infrastructure, and it sounds like a more bullish view. Is it something that you're seeing globally or is it anything that you're seeing particular region, be it China coming back or Europe or North America getting a little bit better? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think in this quarter, we saw probably better performance in Europe on an organic basis than we saw in other regions. We saw a strong performance also in Asia. And we had growth in North America but the most robust part of that performance clearly was in Europe. Look, our performance in mobile networks is just a great example of the fact that when the chips are down, we don't just throw them on the table and run away. In fact, we know that in a space like that, there are cycles. Last year was clearly a down cycle, the year prior was a good cycle and two years before that were not great cycles. And regardless of what the given cycle of the day is, we know that the ultimate demand for mobile networks comes from the rapid acceleration of the proliferation of mobile broadband, and that continues unabated. When do operators spend their money, on what do they spend their money, what are the nature of the architecture of the various systems that they're using, where are the constant opportunities for us. Those are all things that are changing on a constant basis. But they're all ultimately paying homage to and servicing an end demand which appears to continue to grow without limit. And so, our strategy is just a very simple one, continue to broaden our product offering, continue to work with customers at every geography and across service providers and equipment manufacturers to make sure that we are really the first phone call for them and there with them on the day that they want to design that next-generation system. Maximizing our position, maximizing our content on that equipment that they need so dearly to ultimately support the demands of the networks. And I think, I really give a lot of credit to our team. It's not easy to do that when your sales are down like they were last year by 18% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies. But the team did a fabulous job. And I think the fact that we've seen now two quarters of strong performance, really indeed accelerating performance when you look at the growth here in the second quarter, it's just a great validation for that very aggressive and simple approach that we take. And to give us now the confidence to expect for the full year some growth in a market that we previously did not expect, we're really pleased with that. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : The growth for the year, is it kind of a \u2013 it would be a continuation in the second half of these second quarter dynamics in terms of regional trends and your ability to continue to take share? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I don't know in the second half would it necessarily be the same regional trends. In all honesty, we don't necessarily even have specific forecasts by region in that way. But I wouldn't be surprised if it's a relatively similar continuation as we go into the second half. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question is a follow-up on the FCI margins. I think the original guidance was for FCI EBIT margins to be low-double digits. And if I try and back into what $0.03 of margin improvement implies, I think kind of gets you to a little over 200 bps of improvement, so maybe low-teens on average now for the year which, if you're getting better over the course of the year, should we be thinking that as you exit 2016 that FCI EBIT margins are something like 16%, maybe a little bit better? R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I think without going to a specific number, we're pleased that the operating performance is improving. And I think right now, it's maybe too early to say ultimately what the numbers will be. But you're correct in presuming that there is an improvement. And ultimately what that improvement will be by the end of the year still remains to be seen but we're just really excited about that improvement. And as I mentioned earlier, it's just an outstanding embrace of Amphenol at every level by the people of FCI that has ultimately resulted in them accelerating more than we had expected their operating performance improvement. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on OpEx, SG&A dollars. Should we be thinking about SG&A dollars declining on an absolute basis in September versus June? Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I think normally from an SG&A perspective, certainly, we operate pretty efficiently and cost effectively from that perspective. SG&A is, I think, at a very effective rate for the sales. Our product development and technology expansion is very key in terms of how we spend our money from an SG&A perspective. I think if you look at the second half of the year, I would expect that, as a percentage of sales, that our SG&A would certainly continue to decline as we get leverage on the increased sales. From an absolute dollar perspective, I don't necessarily know that that would essentially go down on higher volumes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks, Adam and Craig. I think you guys did a good job of explaining the puts and takes on sales for the full year guidance, but when we think about the EPS number, you guys raised the EPS guidance by about $0.02 at the midpoint. But you beat this quarter by $0.02 and you added about $0.03 from FCI. So, should we think about the FX impact and the macro stuff as being sort of a $0.02 to $0.03 hit to the full year and that's the offset to that, similar to revenue? Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Thanks. This is actually a good question. And I think your math actually is quite good in regard to that. FCI did add about $0.03, as I mentioned, and then we had the FX impact that Adam mentioned, which comes with it, a normal kind of a margin perspective and impacting us by about $0.02. And then you have essentially about \u2013 the difference essentially being the acquisition impact on the additional $40 million in the acquisitions that we did. A little bit lower profitability than the average of the company currently. So, that's why it brings a little bit less from an EPS accretion perspective. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, Adam, your IT and datacom segment is doing very well. It's 20% of revenue at this point, and typically Amphenol's strengths in their model has been that no segment is larger than 20%, that you're pretty well diversified. Would the strength expected to continue in IT and datacom? Is there some risks that this segment becomes too big, or do you need to offset that with more strength in another segment? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, thank you very much, Sherri. I think if you look back over the years, it's true that today no segment represents more than 20% in the quarter. But we've had years where it's been a little bit more 20%, 25%. I think if you go back all the way to 2006, IT datacom was 25% of our sales. I think if you go back we had may be a year where Mil-Aero was a bit higher as a percent of sales. So, it's not that 20% is the bright line. I think there is a level beyond which we wouldn't go, what is that? Is it 30%, is it something like \u2013 somewhere in that range probably makes us a little bit less comfortable. What's most important though is that we have that breadths and balance across all of our end markets. We think it is a tremendous asset for the company to have that diversification and balance, in addition to have it within the market. And so, as we look at an IT datacom market, I mentioned earlier that the growth that we're seeing in that market is actually a lot driven by some of these newer customers and this sort of almost re-architecting of the nature of the market. And I think that's just the great credit to the interim market diversification that we have in IT datacom. But no, we're not putting the brakes on the IT datacom. It doesn't change our investment strategy. It doesn't change our appetite for acquisitions or otherwise, but we continue to be very sensitive that whatever we do strategically, we will maintain a good balance and we won't be over-relying on one or another of our markets for the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Unknown Speaker : Good afternoon. This is actually Mike (01:02:26) for Jim at Citi. Just one question, if I may. So we saw that the Cable business saw a nice operating margin improvement. So, do you believe that's something sustainable, or is it something even that can continue to improve going forward? Thank you. Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, sure. Yeah, we are very pleased certainly with the growth and resulting profitability performance of the Cable segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, margin improved from 11.8% last year to $14.9%. I would say this three point increase -as again I mentioned in my prepared remarks reflects strong operating execution on this additional volume as the segment grew by about 11% related to the broadband market strength. The team really also did really a nice job to diversify the business since it's really higher margin products and maintained really a strong pricing discipline. I should also note that there was also some favorable impacts from commodities. I think if you look going into the second half of the year, Adam did mention that we expect that broadband market to moderate slightly into the second half. And as such, we would expect some moderation in the Cable segment profitability based on kind of normal conversions. But I would say based on the current commodity environment essentially \u2013 certainly if that doesn't change and demand environment doesn't change, then we would expect the profitability to be roughly in this range, flexing up and down based on whatever the volumes do. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Very good. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Just one quick question from me on the cash flow. So, you're running well above the 1 times net income that you guys target; it's closer to 120%. So, is there anything unusual in the first half cash flows that would make us think that's not sustainable in the second half, or has something changed with your scale and operations that maybe even more cash flow efficient? Thanks. Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Actually the answer is \u2013 in regard to any unusual items in the quarter is, no, we had no real unusual items of note that would have increased our cash flow. This is the cash flow that we achieved in the first quarter. It's really a great cash flow. We've actually \u2013 it's not really abnormal. We've had similar cash flow as a percentage of net income probably for the last number of quarters, going back probably a couple of years at least. So, I would say that this is probably a cash flow generation that we would expect going forward as well from the company. We generated a strong cash flow for the business. The company does really a great job using its \u2013 managing its working capital and certainly in order to really maximize the cash flow they are able to generate to be able to invest back into the business and through M&A and other things to use our cash for. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Brian White from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. Adam, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the dynamics you're seeing in the sensor markets, obviously a big opportunity, you made a couple of acquisitions in that area. So, maybe talk about your traction there and some of the dynamics and what you're seeing. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks very much, Brian. Look, we remain very excited about the sensor market. We got into the market now more than two and a half years ago. Time really flies fast here, since we acquired first the Advanced Sensor business from GE. I can just tell you that the team has done an outstanding job in our sensor business. We are growing. We are improving the operating performance. We're expanding the range of opportunities in our pipeline. We are working in collaboration with the connector operations. I alluded to one of those areas where that's happening more intensively with places like hybrids and batteries. And we continue to be just very excited about the space. In addition, we continue to hunt for acquisitions in the sensor market. We have an excellent pipeline. The market can still \u2013 really reminds us of a bit like the Interconnect market of a decade or two ago, a very fragmented market, lots of diversity from a technology perspective, from a customer and geographical perspective. And I can just tell you two thumbs up from our perspective in terms of the assessment two and half years in. It is a space which is also not without challenges sometimes, I mean, you have competition, you have technology change, you have programs \u2013 that common programs that go very much like you have in the connector industry. And I think our team and the culture of Amphenol, as it is now reflected in those companies that are in our sensor business, is just so much better equipped to deal with those dynamics than they may have been under their previous shareholders. And I think of all the values that we have brought by those two acquisitions that we've made, so far, it is really incubating in them that agility and reactivity, the aggressiveness to shift towards where the opportunities are and not just hang your hat on something that may or may not be doing well. I mean, I look at our sensor business and we talked at the time when we first acquired it that we had some automotive business, we had some in heavy equipment, we had some in medical, where you can imagine, heavy equipment overall is a bit more of a challenging space. The team has just done an amazing job of pivoting their technology efforts, pivoting their sales coverage and applications coverage towards where the opportunities are and doing that both on their own and in collaboration with others in Amphenol. So, we're really excited. We're still small in sensors. We are still on a relative from a market share of the overall broad market for sensors. We still have just a very small position, and that's also exciting because it gives me great confidence that we can expand long term both organically as well as through our robust acquisition program. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : And Adam, just any color on wireless infrastructure in India. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Actually, Craig and I were in India recently. And we are just really pleased with how we've done in India. We've been in the mobile infrastructure in India. We're not new comers to that space. In fact, I think we've been from the greater part of a decade and a half participating in the Indian mobile infrastructure market, I mean, I personally have over the years spent a lot of time going to operators and OEMs in the Indian market. And I think that long-term patience and investment in the time, in the relationships and in the native creation of technology and great team that is there, that has positioned us really well in India. And we saw towards the tail half of last year, the beginnings of some good performance, and we have continued to see that this year. And our expectation is to have really \u2013 India be a good contributor to our mobile infrastructure business. Operator : Thank you. At this time, speakers, I'm showing no further questions in queue. R. Adam Norwitt - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Very good. Well thank you very much. And we truly appreciate everybody's attention today. And we wish that you all have a wonderful conclusion to the summer with hopefully a break between now and the next time that we see you for you and your families. Thanks again, and we'll talk to you in three months. Bye-bye. Craig A. Lampo - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

[Operator Instructions] At the request of our company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I would like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome everyone to our third quarter conference call. Q3 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then Q&A. We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So, please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $1.636 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.71, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.73. Sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of \u201815. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency sales in the third quarter increased 2%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 5% organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 14% from last year primarily due to the strength in the broadband market. The interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 12% from last year primarily driven by the impact of the FCI acquisition as well as organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $326 million and 19.9% respectively. Adjusted operating income increased to $333 million in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was a new record at 20.3% compared to 20.2% in the third quarter of 2015 and 19.4% in the second quarter of 2016. The significant 90 basis points sequential improvement in the operating margin reflects a particular \u2013 in particular, the excellent progress in profitability made by the FCI management team, which they have achieved through the successful combination of their leading technology and the adoption of our strong operating discipline. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9% compared to 12.5% last year. The increase in margins related primarily to the strong operating execution on the additional volume as well as the benefit from the favorable impact of commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were 22.2% compared to 22.3% last year and 21.2% last quarter. The significant sequential increase in the interconnect operating margins reflects the improvement in the FCI acquisition profitability I just mentioned as well as good operational execution on the additional volume. We continue to be very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies, the management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance. The company has recorded acquisition-related transaction costs of approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share during the third quarter. Interest expense for this quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s stock buyback programs. On a GAAP basis, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.9% and 26.5% for the third quarter of \u201816 and 2015 respectively. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 included the effect of the $6 million of acquisition-related transaction expenses incurred, which had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate by 40 basis points. Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the quarter. And on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.71 and $0.65 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.73 and $0.65 in the third quarter of \u201816 and \u201815 respectively. Orders for the quarter were a record $1.698 billion, an 18% increase over the third quarter of \u201815, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $291 million in the third quarter or approximately 130% of net income. For the 9 months, operating cash flow was $729 million or approximately 124% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $927 million at the end of the quarter. Inventory days were 75, down 4 days compared to June. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of September. Days sales outstanding was 71 days, down approximately 2 days from June. Accounts payable was $651 million at the end of the quarter and payable days were 53, down approximately 2 days compared to June. The cash flow from operations of $291 million, along with commercial paper borrowings of $128 million and stock option proceeds of $70 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $121 million of the company\u2019s stock, to fund acquisitions of approximately $87 million, to fund net capital expenditures of $47 million and to fund dividend payments of $43 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $192 million net of translation. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares, approximately 1.5 million shares remain available under the stock repurchase program through January of \u201817. And as mentioned in the earnings release, the company\u2019s Board of Directors had approved a 14% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company\u2019s common stock from $0.14 to $0.16 per share bringing the dividend yield to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.017 billion, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. And at the end of the quarter, the company had issued $982 million under its commercial paper program. The company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion at the end of the quarter. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3 billion and net debt was approximately $2 billion and the third quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $389 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent performance. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and our current trends. Adam Norwitt : Very good. Thank you very much, Craig. And I would like to add my welcome to all of you here on the phone today and thank you very much for taking time with us here on a lovely fall afternoon. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I will then spend some time to discuss the trends and progress across our diversified served markets. And finally, I will make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter, and of course, for the full year 2016. I think Craig just went through the numbers, but I will just restate here that the third quarter was really an excellent quarter for the company. We established new records in orders, sales and EPS, all while reaching the highest level of profitability in the company\u2019s history. These achievements are particularly significant given the ongoing uncertainties that are still present in the worldwide economy. Revenue has increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically reaching the new record of $1.636 billion and I think Craig mentioned that we booked record orders, nearly $1.7 billion, $1.698 billion in orders, which represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.04:1. We are particularly proud of our operating margins in the quarter, which reached the all-time high of 20.3%, up 90 basis points from the second quarter. As Craig alluded to, this margin expansion resulted from excellent operational execution, including continued progress in improving the performance of FCI. Given this faster than expected margin expansion by the FCI team, we now expect the FCI acquisition to contribute $0.18 to our 2016 earnings per share. This compares to our prior outlook of $0.15 for the accretion this year. I can just tell you that we find it especially gratifying to see the benefits of the Amphenol management culture so clearly demonstrated in the performance of our new acquisitions. Craig also mentioned our operating cash flow, which was a very robust $291 million and that\u2019s just a clear sign of the continued quality of the company\u2019s earnings and that has then been reflected with our Board of Directors approving a 14% increase in the company\u2019s dividend effective in the first quarter. I will just say how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this organization\u2019s entrepreneurial agility has enabled the company to achieve strong performance amidst an uncertain and a very dynamic worldwide economy. Our financial strength in the quarter also enabled us to make further progress in our acquisition program as we recently brought two new companies into the Amphenol family. All Systems Broadband, which we closed at the end of September, is a U.S. based provider of high technology, value add copper and fiber optic interconnect solutions, in particular for the broadband market. All Systems has annual sales of approximately $40 million. This company is the leader, in particular for both consumer premises as well as important central office applications in support of high speed data and video delivery for the broadband market and a truly an exciting growth area for the company. SGX Sensortech, which closed at the beginning of October, is the Switzerland based supplier of air quality sensors with annual sales of approximately $15 million. SGX, which manufactures at its facility in Poland, is a provider of really high technology air quality sensors that are used in both the automotive and the industrial markets. It\u2019s a real pleasure really to welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, our fourth and fifth acquisitions of the year. And going forward, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Turning to our progress across our various served markets, I just want to point out that in the third quarter, we continued to have an extremely balanced and diversified end market exposure with no single market representing more than 21% of our sales. I will tell you this diversification is truly a valuable asset for Amphenol, especially in these very dynamic times. The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased from prior year by 6%, driven by growth in naval, space, airframe and communications applications. I will just say that this is really robust performance given the overall military spending environment as this was all organic growth. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% as we began to recover from the Defense Logistic Agency stopped shipment order that we have discussed over the last couple of quarters. We are, in fact, very proud of the outstanding work of our military aerospace team, who has managed the recovery from the DLA\u2019s stopped ship so well. We are really fortunate actually to have forged outstanding long-term relationships with both our military customers as well as our distribution partners and have truly appreciated their patience and closed collaboration during this challenging time. In fact, our customers and partners have been extremely pleased with the agility and reactivity of our aerospace team and it again reaffirms our reputation as a leader in this important market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to again increase from these levels and we continue to anticipate modest growth for the full year 2016 and that\u2019s even with the impact from the DLA issue. Our long-term leadership position in the military market remains very strong as we continue to have the broadest range of high technology products designed into virtually all defense equipment. We look forward to building upon this position of strength into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a strong 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies from prior year as we realized stronger sales of our products designed into new airplane platforms. As we had expected, sales were up moderately from the second quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate a modest increase in sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, we continue to expect sales to be flat to modestly up as the impact from the DLA issue, together with lower expected demand for helicopters and business jets, offsets the positive impact that we have seen from growing production volumes of new airplane platforms. I will just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the long-term opportunity in the commercial air market. With our strong technology position with airplane manufacturers around the world, together with the proliferation of electronics on and increasing volumes of new aircraft platforms, we are very confident for the long-term in this exciting market. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 22% from prior year. This growth was driven by contributions from the FCI and AUXEL acquisitions as well as by growth in the hybrid bus and truck, battery, heavy equipment and instrumentation segments, which were in part offset by slower sales in the oil and gas and rail mass transit. Organically, our sales in the quarter increased by 2%. Sequentially, sales grew slightly as contributions from AUXEL were offset by a normal seasonal moderation of sales that we would typically see in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales in the industrial market to grow moderately from these levels. And we continue to expect very strong sales growth in the industrial market for the full year as we benefit from the contributions of FCI and AUXEL together with organic growth from a range of exciting segments within the industrial market. We are continuing to build upon our successful diversified industrial business as we expand our high technology interconnect, sensor and antenna products across a broad array of industrial customers around the globe. The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically as we made continued progress in penetrating new interconnect and sensor applications in both traditional and hybrid electric vehicles and also accelerated our sales in Asia. Sales were up slightly from prior quarter on typical summer seasonality in the U.S. and Europe. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to grow from these levels. And for the full year 2016, we remain confident to achieve continued strong growth in the automotive market. We continued to be excited by our long-term prospects in the automotive market as we are still making excellent progress in designing in our broadened range of interconnect sensors and antennas into new electronic systems incorporated into a wide array of vehicle platforms. The acquisition of SGX, while relatively small, builds out our sensor product line for air quality application, an important growth area for the automotive industry. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our strengthened position for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down as expected by 22% from prior year on reduced sales into all categories of mobile devices with the notable exception of wearables. Sequentially, our sales rose by a strong 17% from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect the mid-teens sales decline and we continue to expect full year sales in the mobile devices market to decline by more than 10% from 2015. Regardless of the still challenging outlook for 2016, we remain extremely confident that our highly reactive and agile organization will continue to secure a strong position in the mobile devices market by capitalizing on our excellent technology positions across a wide range of next generation mobile computing platforms. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically. This was a bit stronger than expected as we again benefited from the contributions of FCI together with stronger sales of antennas and interconnect products to network operators, particularly in Europe. Our sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we anticipate a further moderation of sales due to the typical year end seasonality. Nevertheless, we continued to expect to achieve low to mid single-digit organic growth for the full year 2016, which together with the very strong contributions from the FCI acquisition will result in an excellent growth year for the mobile networks market. Our strong performance in this market in 2016 is really a direct reflection of our team\u2019s unwavering drive to promote our leading technology interconnect and antenna products to OEMs as well as service providers around the world and that\u2019s regardless of the normal ebbs and flows of wireless capital spending. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance in IT datacom was much stronger than expected in the third quarter as sales grew 55% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 19% organically. This excellent performance was driven by contributions from FCI and Custom Cable as well as by robust organic growth in servers, storage and networking applications. And in particular, we accelerated our progress in selling into next-generation web service providers. Sales increased a very robust 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the second quarter. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase of sales from these higher levels. Given our much stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we now expect for the full year growth of more than 40%, which reflects the contributions of the FCI and Custom Cable acquisitions as well as approximately 10% organic growth. I will just say that our team focused on the important IT datacom market is clearly doing an outstanding job of positioning Amphenol as the leader with a broad range of customers with the widest array of high technology products. We continue to support our traditional and next-generation customers in their ongoing quest to upgrade their equipment to handle the continued dramatic increases in data traffic. The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and we are very pleased that our sales increased from prior year by a stronger than expected 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically as broadband operators continue to expand their network build-out activity to enable better network performance. Sales in this market were slightly down on a sequential basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect an increase of sales with the addition of All Systems Broadband and we now expect to achieve low double-digit growth in the broadband market for the full year of 2016. With the acquisition of ASB, we now have a broader offering of products used in both consumer premises as well as in the service provider head-end systems including importantly, an array of value-add fiber-optic solutions. That newly expanded range of interconnect and cable products, together with our excellent position with broadband operators around the world, positions us very well for the long-term. So just in summary, I want to say that we are extremely proud of the company\u2019s outstanding record results here in the third quarter of 2016. While the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extremely well through our consistent dual-pronged strategy of driving organic growth while pursuing complementary acquisitions. And that strategy is enabling us to expand our market position while also strengthening the company\u2019s financial performance. And ultimately, the company\u2019s superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct, competitive advantages : our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets around the world, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program as well as most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year and based on the continuation of current global economic environment and as well as assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.585 billion to $1.625 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 respectively. This represents a sales and EPS increase versus prior year of $0.11 to 13% and 13% to 16% respectively. For the full year 2016, we expect sales in the range of $6.220 billion to $6.260 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $2.68 to $2.70. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted EPS growth of 12% and 10% to 11% respectively over 2015 levels. We are really encouraged by the company\u2019s strength and outlook now for 2016 and we all look forward to driving further success going forward despite the many dynamics in the global economy. I remain truly confident in the ability of Amphenol\u2019s outstanding management team to build upon these robust results and to continue to capitalize on the many opportunities to both grow our market position and expand our profitability in 2016 and beyond. Thank you very much. And operator, at this time, we would be happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Jim Suva \u2013 sorry, Wamsi Mohan. Sir, your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Adam, your operating margins were clearly outstanding here. Are we in an era where you can see that the de minimis price declines that you have historically seen in this connector industry actually stop and ASPs start to potentially rise driving further margin upside? Because companies might be willing to pay for the high-performance connectivity that is needed to keep things from blowing up as all of us have heard about or is there a natural ceiling here to margins other than the fact that you are trying to balance revenue growth? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. First, on your question on pricing, I wouldn\u2019t say that there is a new world order on pricing. I mean, this continues to be a very, very competitive market, a very competitive industry that\u2019s natural in an environment where you see commodity prices relatively lower and you see overall economic growth being relatively muted. And that\u2019s typically not an environment where you see a truly favorable pricing environment. So, no doubt about it, our teams continue to do battle with competition. At the same time, as we have always said, if we can create value for our customers through technology, through service, through quality, through appropriate reactivity to their requirements for delivery and otherwise, well then, our customers will always pay us a reasonable and a fair price. And I think that\u2019s something that when we look across the company, our team is just doing an outstanding job of executing on all of those fronts. So, it doesn\u2019t mean that there is some new pricing dynamic. I think what it means is that we are executing our way to those new higher levels of margins and we are really proud of those margins. I mean, ultimately, margins is just a very simple calculation, as I always say, of price minus cost and embedded in that is all those things that we talk about. Now ultimately, what is the natural profitability of the business? I mean, we know what the profitability of the business was here in the third quarter. We achieved 20.3% operating margin. Is the natural profitability higher or lower than that? I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s something we have ever talked about. We always do talk about the fact though that as the company grows, we seek to drive conversion margins at a level that will allow us to achieve margin expansion, and we have continued to have a focus on those 25% conversion margins. And when you couple that with the strong execution with our acquisitions and in particular, with FCI, you get ultimately the performance that we saw this quarter. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks, Adam. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from James Suva of Citibank. Sir, your line is now open. James Suva : Thanks very much. A strategy question for Adam and then maybe a finance question for Craig, Adam, on the strategy question, FCI, you commented is progressing and integrating better than expected, which is a good thing. Does that \u2013 the size of that if I remember right unless my math is wrong was the all-time biggest acquisition Amphenol has ever done. And if that\u2019s true and it\u2019s progressing well, does that give you more confidence that maybe bigger acquisitions are kind of the way to go or how should we think about that? And then the finance question for Craig is the coaxial business is hitting some pretty good operating profitability. I know it\u2019s due to volumes but also copper and aluminum prices have been favorable. Are those margins pretty sustainable or is there a point where the customers start asking to pay copper and aluminum has come lower. Therefore, they want to give some price perhaps or is that already built into the results that we are seeing of the improvement and profitability? Thank you guys and congratulations. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Jim. Maybe I will let Craig address the cable margins and I will come back to the strategy question. Craig Lampo : Sure, Jim. I think, certainly we are very pleased with the growth in profitability of the cable segment. I mean, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, the margin improved from \u2013 the 14.9% from 12.5% last year. Last quarter, we were also at 14.9%, I believe in the cable segment. This 2.4 point increase from last year does really reflect the strong operating execution on the additional volume of the team. I mean, the segment grew over \u2013 grew 14% over last year driven primarily by the broadband market. I mean, the team has really done a nice job to diversify this business into higher margin products, which we certainly think has helped the profitability in this business and they have been able to maintain a strong pricing discipline. Certainly, there is still pricing pressures within this business as there is with all our businesses, but they have certainly been able to do a good job of changing a bit of the mix in this business that they try to increase it. But I will note and I think you mentioned that there has been certainly a favorable impact on commodities. And I would say if there was some significant change in the commodity pricing that we certainly have an impact on this particular business, which is a little bit more sensitive to commodities than even our interconnect business might be. So whether or not this is the norm going forward, it\u2019s tough to say with this commodity environment we are in here today. But certainly, they have done good job and we expect that this is certainly a new benchmark for them to build from. Adam Norwitt : Absolutely and just with respect to your question on strategy and specifically, our appetite for bigger acquisitions, if we just recall back and those like you Jim, who followed the company for a long time will know, our criteria for acquisitions has actually been very consistent for a long time. First and foremost, we think about the people and we look for people who are strong entrepreneurs, who have great management talent because we don\u2019t have an organization necessarily that has lots of people sitting on the bench waiting to go run these acquisitions. So number one is the people. Number two is always the technology. We look for companies with really leading edge, valuable technology that can find \u2013 that can allow their customers to drive better products ultimately and then thereby allow us to make better returns. We also look for complementary market positions. And I think in the case of FCI, we had all three of those. What has never been our criteria for acquisitions and continues not to be is size. Now, I will say it\u2019s no doubt about it, FCI was in fact the biggest acquisition that we have made in the history of the company and we are very pleased so far with the results of that. Does that drive in us a greater level of confidence about making bigger acquisitions I don\u2019t know that it changes our level of confidence. We had already a pretty good confidence in the model. But I would say that it reconfirms that we believe that the acquisition strength of Amphenol, the program of Amphenol and the competency that we have is really a wonderful strength for the company and it\u2019s a real pillar of the value that we create in addition to all the other things that we do to drive organic growth in the company. And so it certainly does not take away from the confidence. And if the right company came along at whatever size, we would be willing to look at that as long as it fit with those other criteria that we cling so importantly to. James Suva : Thank you for the details. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thank you. Adam, I was hoping you could give us some commentary on your thoughts on the macro environment specific to the connector market, I mean if you look at your \u2013 of course you had an excellent quarter, but organic growth is only about 2%, clearly the mobile devices declines are a significant drag on the growth, but you guys are doing great job on the IC data side and automotive, so wanted to get your sense about what is the overall demand trends that you are seeing and do you think that improves next year or is that \u2013 are we still going to be in a relatively muted environment? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Sherri. I mean look, I am not an expert on the overall macro environment. I will tell you that I don\u2019t believe that the macro environment has largely changed this year. It remains relatively muted and uncertain, both geopolitically and economically. I think that if you look at just the various companies in the world that at least are public and the various markets that we serve, there is clearly not an overall trend of improvement. If you look at our company though in the third quarter and you pointed it out very astutely here, Sherri. If you would take the mobile devices, which is no doubt about it, a significant decline on a year-over-year basis, if you exclude that we grew by more than 7% organically in the quarter and that is really a testament to the diversification of the company. Now, you go back to last year, our mobile devices business was up 13% and other parts of the business were not growing at that rate. And I think what you see is the consistency of the performance in light of the diversification of the business. It\u2019s true. This quarter, we had just fabulous performance from IT datacom, up 19% organically, 55% growth with the benefits of FCI and Custom Cable. And I think that that\u2019s just a fabulous performance. But also let\u2019s not forget that IT datacom has had a few tough years. We have done may be a bit better than the market. But if you look last year, we grew just 2% in IT datacom while may be the overall market was down. Our team, despite that 2%, continued to drive aggressively with customers to expand our position, to develop the new and appropriate products, to pivot towards where the growth opportunities and the potential growth opportunities could be. And we are able to realize the benefits of that here in the third quarter and we expect to be able to do so for the total year 2016. But is that a reflection of an improving IT datacom market or rather a reflection of our team really ferreting out where the growth is in an otherwise muted environment, I personally believe it\u2019s more of the latter than the former. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much Sherri. Operator : And our next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Hi, good afternoon everybody. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Shawn Harrison : I guess two questions if I may. When looking at the mobile device business, it looked like maybe just demand was pulled forward into the third quarter, but your full year view didn\u2019t change whatsoever and maybe if you could just clarify whether I am correct in that assessment. And then second just looking at FCI and accretions stepping up once again, is the revenue profile of FCI improving or is the final kind of end target margin assumption of FCI heading up now that you had it on your belt now for, I don\u2019t know better part of 10 months? Adam Norwitt : Yes. So on your first question, I don\u2019t think there was a real meaningful pull forward. We did maybe just a hair better in the third quarter than we had anticipated. I think we have guided to a bit more than 10%. We ended up with 17%. It was plus or minus. But for the full year, we continue to see it as expected. So was there a slight pull forward, I mean really ever so slight. The strength that we saw in the third quarter was really predominantly from IT datacom and then followed by mobile networks and broadband. We continue to have a similar view of the mobile devices market this year. We have talked about that quite a bit over the last \u2013 in particular, at the last call and we continued to have our team poised in case there are opportunities that come about. And sometimes those opportunities do come about. But you never know. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult market to forecast and an incredibly dynamic market, but we remain with a very, very strong position with customers across the board. Relative to your question on FCI just very simply, the revenue has been really at the expectations that we came into the year with. The improvement in the performance of FCI from an accretion perspective has really improved operating performance and the team has just done an outstanding job really beyond our expectations, maybe not beyond our best wishes but certainly, beyond our expectations coming into the year. And they continue to drive the company to a level of performance that I think none of them really thought would have seen in such a great fashion. And so we really commend them just on a fabulous, fabulous job. Operator : And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. I guess two questions for me. One on FCI, if I run the math correctly, I think you guys are implying about 15% or so op margins for core FCI at this point, which is still below your corporate average, can you just up about do you see room for further accretion provided FCI gets in line to your corporate average margins and if you feel generous, would love to get a time line on that? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Amit, whether you are referring to full year or the quarter. I mean FCI has gotten pretty darn close right now in the course of these and now our third quarter. And so they are operating \u2013 they have gotten there faster than we would have expected to our corporate average. But I don\u2019t know if you are referring the 15% to the full year. We \u2013 as I said, we now see $0.18 of accretion with FCI. That compares to the $0.15 that we saw before. And we are very pleased with where they are today. And I think from now, we have a really strong business and a platform to go forward with. Amit Daryanani : Got it. I was thinking of it on annual basis, but you might be right, it might be done, the quarterly numbers already, I guess then Adam, on IT datacom side, you are seeing some very impressive growth here we are setting most other data center companies are talking about. Could you just talk about the sustainability of these trends and is there a way to think about how much of this segment today is probably levered to hyper scale customers versus the traditional enterprise customers you have had? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean the sustainability, I think all of the markets that we are in are very dynamic. And IT datacom is clearly one of those, so are there going to be ups and downs in that market over the coming years, I would bet that there would be ups and downs. But I think what\u2019s clear in this quarter is that we have positioned ourselves with the acquisition of FCI as well as with our organic initiatives to broaden our product offering and to deepen the technology that we offer to customers. We have positioned ourselves as the clear leader in this space. There is no doubt about it. And so as we go to customers who are all struggling to deal with these increases in data rates, demanding customers, the new dynamics that come with the web scale players and cloud computing and everything that is entailed with that, we become really the first phone call. And I think that that\u2019s a wonderful place to be in. So, regardless of the ups and downs that may come in overall IT spending, we want to be the leader and we want to be the first phone call and we want to be the partner for next generation designs and that\u2019s what we have really become here. In terms of the web scale providers, I couldn\u2019t quote for you a number which tells you how much it is as a percent of the total, but I will tell you it\u2019s a really big part of why we are growing in such a fast pace. Is it all the growth? No, certainly not. There are also some really interesting companies that are growing around the world in that space, but it\u2019s clearly growing at a much faster pace than our overall IT market and it\u2019s starting to be a meaningful part of our business. And our team has just done an outstanding job to accommodate and to pivot towards these new web scale companies, which are not always the easiest companies to do business with. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the questions and congratulations on the nice reports. First question is on mobile devices, so Adam, I think you guided down double-digits for this year obviously coming off a strong 2015 and I think if I recall correctly last year benefited from some of the test equipment sales and mobile devices or maybe a little bit more one-time in nature and set it up for a harder comp for \u201816 in mobile devices. As you look into 2017 in mobile devices, is there anything obviously subject to how the market would grow, but anything that would make you think you could grow above or below what units we do in that market either in terms of content, market share or pricing? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t point to anything with 2017. This is a hard market to forecast in one quarter, and to start to talk about what 2017 would be for mobile devices, I would be pretty far out ahead of my skis on that one. What I do know is that we have a very broad position. We have continued to broaden that position this year despite being down and I think that we go into next year from a position of strength. So, what does that end up being? We will hopefully be able to tell you with some degree of certainty coming into January. Mark Delaney : That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up question on mobile networks, second quarter, you guys have done well in that segment. Obviously, one of the big equipment OEMs negatively pre-announced and talked about some weakness. Do you think there is a disconnect there that you guys can sustain and maybe just kind of help us understand why you are maybe doing better than the European telco equipment company and maybe as you are coming off of a low base or its increased capacity builds, but any sort of thoughts on why you are doing a little bit better would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Look, I mean I am not the expert on why certain companies are doing better or worse. I know that why we did better in the quarter, in particular, as we saw really stronger growth in our business and support directly of service providers. And we have talked about for a number of years the changing nature of the mobile networks market, where our business used to be really an OEM focused business and really everything that we sold into the mobile networks market was really via those OEMs. And I think the dynamics in the market, the architecture of the system, the real makeup of the market has changed to a pretty big extent, whereby service providers are now directly interacting with companies like us, where we are providing a broader range of products, including everything from antennas to a broad range of interconnect products, and whereby we are not just rising and falling with the fate of necessarily the OEMs. We continue to have a very strong position with the OEMs and we continue to support them really very closely and as partners that they are, but we have as well transitioned to having that direct interface with certain operators around the world. When you work directly with the operators, it\u2019s also not necessarily for the faint of heart, because this is a much more volatile business. I think that we have had to and our team has very successfully made that transition. We have really had to become more agile and more reactive because of the much quicker dynamics that come when you are putting crews out in the field and putting towers up on relatively moment\u2019s notice. We saw particularly strength in mobile networks in Europe and in the service provider this last quarter. Is that going to continue? We had a similar picture, I guess, in the second quarter. What\u2019s that going to be in the fourth quarter going forward? I would expect it would change, but how is it going to change, what\u2019s the nature of that going to \u2013 change going to be? I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell at this point. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Mark. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Wood from Macquarie. Your line is now open. Mike Wood : Hi, thanks for all the commentary already. I just wanted to follow-up on two end markets. First, on the network data and IT where you are seeing the better-than-expected results that you called out, I am just curious on your thoughts when I think about the weak macro environment that you speak about, I typically think about markets typically being more CapEx reliant or more confidence driven. And I appreciate your thoughts that you had said this \u2013 a lot of this is Amphenol specific, but I am also seeing it across other companies exposed to that end market. So, just give your thoughts in terms of are we now seeing a reinvestment after years of just under-investing in that or can you just speak about your thoughts there? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I think you are correct. IT is in part at least a CapEx-driven market. I guess, as it transitions more and more towards cloud and service provider, it becomes even more of a CapEx-driven market. I think there is no question that the demand on the network has never faltered whatsoever and that\u2019s even over a few years of much more challenging market environments. But what has not changed is the end user demand, the data traffic, the video traffic going over IP networks, you name it. That is all expanding really, continuing at an accelerating pace. And so you do develop in certain points the pent-up demand. Pent-up demand is similar to what we have seen in years past in the mobile networks market, and I think we have even alluded to the fact that we believe in the IT market, there is some pent-up demand. But then the question comes and that\u2019s the company-specific question. Have you positioned yourself or repositioned yourself to take advantage of where that pent-up demand is going to come from? And I think that had one remained with just traditional customers, that pent-up demand would not be satisfied through those same channels and you could find yourself really continuing to have a business that was in a more stable, almost languishing environment. And I think our team to their credit has truly pivoted, has truly pivoted towards where the demand and where the pent-up demand was building and where the real demand was coming and thereby, we see that as a relative strength of Amphenol in that market. I haven\u2019t seen and I don\u2019t think we have all seen yet all of the results that are coming in this area. There have been a few results that have been announced. And I think those are some ups and some downs. When all is said and done, maybe we will see that this is a more broad market environment. But is that going to be a 19% organic growth? That, I would be \u2013 I would guess we would not see on a broad basis. Mike Wood : Great. And then switching gears onto auto, I think 9% organic. I believe you reported 4% organic growth last quarter. Just curious, what\u2019s driving that step up in organic growth? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks very much. No, I think the automotive business for us did really well this quarter. We are very pleased with the broad basis of that. As I mentioned, we grew 9% organically. We saw particular strength in Asia. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and we have both made acquisitions and put a lot of focus in Asia on working with global and local companies in Asia in particular, in places like China to make sure that we are positioned in what is really the world\u2019s now largest car market and I think we are seeing some of the fruits of those labors. That was a very strong performance for us there. And if you look at our overall business today, it is roughly almost even across the various regions. Europe is maybe a bit more and then Asia and North America are roughly the same size, but that\u2019s a big change for the company. If we go back 7, 8 years, Europe would have been two-thirds of our business and then the rest would have been North America and just a smidgen in Asia. And today, you see a real balanced automotive business and I think that\u2019s both a representation of the market opportunity having changed, but also of our organization having embraced that market opportunity. Specifically, what applications, what types of products? I can tell you that we have seen in our organic growth really across the board, across many applications. When we think about the automotive market, we don\u2019t think of that in terms of a unit of car market. We think of that more in terms of a unit of systems in the car market. And so while you may have in the world 90 million, 92 million, 93 million cars being built, we think of that as some multiple of that in terms of how many electronic systems are being built in those cars and the total number of electronic systems, which ultimately leads to the opportunity for Amphenol, has been growing at a wonderful pace. And then it rests on us to say, what can we capture through technologies such that we can get even a little bit more than our fair share of that. And that\u2019s the building blocks, ultimately of this 9% organic growth. And by the way, a continued positive outlook into next quarter, the fourth quarter, we still believe that there is a little bit of growth on a sequential basis, which is not always the case in the fourth quarter. So I think we have good momentum in our auto business sitting here where we are. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just firstly, again on the auto demand in China, how much when you look at year-over-year was related to sort of tax incentives that are ongoing right now in the region versus you expanding your customer base and if there is any sort of new product categories that you could or system areas that you maybe have expanded into with Chinese OEMs in the last year, any examples there would be helpful too? And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure, Steve. I honestly wouldn\u2019t be able to quote you what\u2019s the tax incentive base and what\u2019s the market base. We are still small in China and in Asia in general. The huge market, our position in overall automotive is still relatively small and our position in Asian automotive is relatively even smaller. And so I think we are able to grow and I think we have grown not necessarily because of certain tax incentives or otherwise, but I think we are expanding our position with customers. And in terms of what specific applications, we have done really well in hybrid electric vehicles, we have done really well in lighting applications, where we made a fabulous acquisition early last year and that company is doing really well, made really great progress in emissions related system, transmissions, you name it. There is a whole kind of list of a wide range of applications where we are participating and seeing still growth opportunities in Asia. Steven Fox : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the industrial markets, not asking you to comment on the macro at all, actually just curious as you look out maybe also a little longer term without putting numbers is around say, the next few quarters, which of these submarkets in industrial do you feel like you sort of have the best head of steam in terms of your order book based on your wins going forward? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean it\u2019s a bit of a tough question. We have seen a lot of volatility across the segments in the industrial market. And it\u2019s a great credit to the diversification that we are still able to drive performance because when you look at something like oil and gas, which continues to be a negative for us, albeit at a much smaller level, is that going to turn around, I am not going to be the first one to predict the turnaround of oil and gas. I think we have had really strong momentum in battery applications and really heavy vehicles and we \u2013 I think we would expect that to have still some legs to it. We have done really well in places like in heavy equipment, which is maybe a little bit contrary to the broader market environment. We have seen great progress in areas in heavy equipment, things like diesel engines, things like the transition of mechanical and hydraulic to electronics. So I think those, we have done very well in. And we feel good about our medical business. Even if the medical business didn\u2019t necessarily grow so substantially in the quarter, we have made just great progress in medical over the course of the year and we feel really good about that. I think the others, there is big segments here like factor automation, instrumentation. Our team has just done a fabulous job of positioning a broader set of products in those areas such that we can get more involved in things like robots and more involved in things like factory control systems. And I think that those have good opportunities for the future as well. Steven Fox : Great. Thank you. It sounds like you love all your children equally. Adam Norwitt : I do Steve. Steven Fox : Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. Maybe a different twist on kind of a macro question just given the subdued environment, certainly the book to bill, 1.04 to 1 stands out is very healthy, so anything you are seeing even if it\u2019s a slightest change in terms of customer behavior or anything of note kind of by geography that\u2019s driving a little bit healthier bookings? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I don\u2019t know that I would point to any specifics, either by geography or type of customer. I think our team is really focused on taking orders off the street and that\u2019s \u2013 there is an aggressiveness with the company, where we know that you can\u2019t ship anything if you don\u2019t have an order. And getting those orders requires you to develop the new products, to get the design in with customers. And ultimately then, that leads finally to the sales. I think we had a very strong book to bill, which is encouraging. Some of our business is on a very short book to bill cycle. You take like the mobile business, that\u2019s not a \u2013 that\u2019s a business where you book and ship really almost at the same time and we have other businesses like military, where you have a little bit longer cycle. And I think we had some \u2013 we had here good bookings. We had actually pretty good bookings in the IT datacom market, not surprisingly given our performance there. And I think that the trend from bookings to me, the fact that we had that strong book to bill is encouraging for the very long-term. And it\u2019s encouraging for the fact that our customers are willing to commit to us on the new products and with the new technologies that we give them. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t read a macro inflection point necessarily because of those bookings if that\u2019s what your question is. Craig Hettenbach : Understood, I appreciate your color there. As a follow-up in the automotive space, given your positioning or increasing positioning in connectors and some exposure on the sensor front as well, do you see a path towards kind of integrated type products or do you see it kind of developing on a more discreet basis, how is your view of kind of how you might position automotive into immediate to longer term? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Look, we have across the company always had a focus on selling. In addition to components value add solutions. And that is not a new strategy for the company. This is actually a strategy that we have had as a bedrock of Amphenol for a long, long time. It\u2019s really selling application specific, value add interconnect solutions to customers, where the underlying basis of that may very well be a very highly designed component, but where in fact, the value add solutions becomes the highly integrated and designed in component for the customer. When we acquired the sensor business of GE and that\u2019s now almost 3 years ago, we talked a lot about the fact that we felt that long-term, that would create an opportunity for having integrated sensor and interconnect solutions for customers. And I can tell you that we have seen that and we have started to see that and we have started to see some positive momentum coming out of that. But it\u2019s not a new thing for us to go to a customer in automotive or industrial or any of our markets and work with them to propose a comprehensive interconnect solution for their product. On one hand, the customers really want it because they are all under pressure to accelerate their design process, to do more with less, in many ways reducing their own R&D spending such that they don\u2019t have to spec each of those little products. And in addition, it gives them a sense that they have ultimately, what I would call before that one throat to choke, where rather than patch working together something, a solution, they can come to a company like Amphenol and we can sell them really a complete interconnect solution. And they can feel the comfort that one company stands behind that whole solution from a quality perspective, from a cost reduction perspective, from a delivery perspective, all the things that matter to those customers that gives them essentially the single throat to choke. And I think that the customers like that. It makes their life a lot easier. It makes it easier for them to design the products and ultimately, it makes it easier for them to sleep well at night knowing that they are going to be able to ship their products on a timely basis with the right quality. So I think that it\u2019s not a new strategy, but it continues to be a core part of our strategy in automotive and in our other markets. Craig Hettenbach : Great. Thanks Adam. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian White from Drexel. Your line is now open. Brian White : Yes. Adam, I am hoping you can update us a little bit on what you are seeing in the sensor market and some of the growth trends relative to Amphenol at large? Adam Norwitt : Yes. We are really pleased with the sensor market. I would tell you that organically, sensors are probably growing a bit better than our overall organic growth rate. And I think that\u2019s a real good thing. We came into the sensor market never with the statement that it will be a faster growing space or more profitable space, but we think it\u2019s always has the potential to be at least as good as the rest of Amphenol. And I would say that we were right about that sense. We see the sensor market as a truly diversified space. And so there are pockets in the sensors which are in some areas which aren\u2019t doing as well and there are pockets in areas that are doing better and that\u2019s a little bit of microcosm of all of Amphenol. You will remember, Brian, at the time we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors business. For us, one of the most compelling things for that company was its diversification, the fact that it operated in industrial and within industrial, it operated across a number of different sub-segments of the industrial market as well as operating in the automotive market. And we are really pleased that we have that diversified company, because it\u2019s getting us also a picture of what the sensor demands are in those markets, so that we can then think about ourselves, our sensor strategy. And when we talk about the acquisition that we made the quarter, it\u2019s a small acquisition, SGX, but there is no question that we saw in our activities in sensors, a real trend towards this requirement for air quality sensing applications both in automotive and in industrial applications. And so when we found the right company, we were very eager to bring them into the Amphenol family to round out and to strengthen our technology position in sensors. So, I think in a nutshell, we feel really good about it. I think it\u2019s performing better than the average across the company and continues to have great potential for us long-term. Brian White : And Adam, what\u2019s the takeaway on telecom infrastructure in China? Obviously, at large for the company, it did well in the quarter, how did China perform? Adam Norwitt : Yes, China did okay. I think that the \u2013 in China and Asia in general, we don\u2019t in our numbers necessarily split those out. As I mentioned earlier, mobile networks, we saw the strongest growth in Europe. And in fact, I will say that the vast majority of our growth in mobile networks organically came in Europe, especially in our service provider, direct to service provider business. And I would say in Asia, it was relatively flattish on a year-over-year basis and in addition on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Obviously, our total mobile networks market grew very strongly in the quarter, in particular with the contributions from FCI. We have a lot of strength in Asia that FCI has brought us and so we have just an outstanding position in Asia. And Asia is a really large part of our mobile networks market, but it was not necessarily the growth driver organically in the third quarter. Brian White : Great, thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Sir, your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Adam, congratulations on a very strong quarter and a great outlook. I just have one small question in the industrial end market. You seem to continue to be doing reasonably well in that end market. We are getting more, I should say, muted or cautious data points from some of the industrial OEMs. Do we ascribe that to Amphenol\u2019s typical stronger ability to find the growth or do you think perhaps we just haven\u2019t seen the whole picture in that end market yet? And as we get more data points, perhaps it won\u2019t look as problematic. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Again, industrial is a really big market. I think Steve Fox said earlier, do I love all of my children equally, and I do, indeed. The industrial market for Amphenol, as I mentioned earlier with Steve\u2019s question, it\u2019s a really broad market. We have a lot of position in a lot of different sub-segments. I don\u2019t know that we are always the best canary in the coal mine for whether that is a positive or a negative trend in the overall industrial market. What I know is that our team is pretty good at ferreting out these opportunities as they may come. You don\u2019t think of an industrial team as being agile. It\u2019s almost by definition the opposite. You think of industrial as being the sort of staid, stable kind of an organization, slow lifecycles, long design cycles, all of that. But I will tell you, our industrial team is a pretty dynamic group of people. And so when they see things like oil and gas being done for now and it\u2019s running on the end of its second year a really tough performance, they don\u2019t just sit back and take their medicine. They go out and they look for new opportunities to find growth wherever they maybe. And I think the overall industrial market if you think about just the biggest trend that is existing in broad industrial, it is this electronification of systems that previously would have been hydraulic and/or mechanic or nonexistent in their functionality. And I think that we see that really across all of the segments that we are in and that is a question of just making sure that you have the right solutions, whether that be a discrete connector, a discrete sensor, an antenna, an integrated interconnect solution, an integrated sensor and connector solution, whatever it maybe, you have to really make sure that you are tailoring your approach to that customer and you really knowing the customer, knowing the market. It\u2019s a very marketing intensive business actually the industrial space, because there is just so many potential customers across these dozens and dozens of sub-segments and staying on top of that and pivoting towards where the right segments are, that\u2019s really important. I know there are big industrial kind of giants in the industry and they may have certain trends at one time or another, but I don\u2019t believe that we are necessarily a proxy for those trends. William Stein : Great, thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks Will. Operator : We show no questions at this time. Adam Norwitt : That\u2019s great. Well, listen, we really appreciate everybody\u2019s time this afternoon and we wish you all a pleasant conclusion here to 2016 and I can\u2019t believe to say it, but we will see you all in 2017. Thanks very much for all your time today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day.",

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in listen-only-mode. At the request of the company this conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir you may now begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. Q4 and full year 2016 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and full year and Adam will give an overview of the business, current trends and then we\u2019ll have Q&A. We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $1.651 billion and diluted EPS of $0.75 meeting the high end of the company's guidance and achieving new records of performance in both sales and EPS. Sales were up 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. From an organic standpoint and excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 4%. Sequentially sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and organically and 2% in local currency. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales was up 18% from the fourth quarter last year with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. The interconnect business which comprise 94% of our sales was up 15% from last year with organic growth as well as the impact of FCI as well as other acquisitions. For the full year 2016 sales were record $6.286 billion, up 13% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 2% organically compared to 2016. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $339 million for the fourth quarter, operating margin was a record 20.5% in the fourth quarter of \u201816 compared to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of last year and up 20 basis points from the third quarter of \u201816 adjusted operating margin of 20.3%. From a segment standpoint in the cable segment margins remain flat at 14.9% compared to last quarter and improved from 12.5% last year. The increase in margins from last year related primarily to strong operating execution on the additional volume, as well as the benefit from favorable impact of commodities. In the interconnect segment, margins were unchanged compared to last year at 22.4% and represented a slight increase over the last quarter of 22.2%, reflecting excellent operating execution throughout the business and a very successful first year of improving performance for FCI, the largest acquisition in the history of the company. We continue to be very pleased with the company\u2019s operating margin achievement both with the full year achievement of 19.8% on an adjusted basis, which reflects the impact of the lower then average profitability level of FCI in the first half and in particular with the consistent quarterly improvement in profitability throughout 2016, culminating in the achievement of 20.5% operating margin in the fourth quarter. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance, action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering for such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies our management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhance performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $18 million compared to $17 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels resulting from the company\u2019s stock buyback programs. The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 26.5% for the fourth quarter of \u201816 and \u201815. For the full year the adjusted effective tax rate was 26.5% in both 2016 and 2015. On a GAAP basis the company\u2019s full year effective tax rate was 27.0% and 26.6% for 2016 and \u201815 respectively, reflecting the tax impact of the acquisition related cost incurred during the respective years. Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of \u201816. Diluted EPS grew 19% to $0.75 in the fourth quarter of \u201916 from $0.63 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS was $2.72, up 12% over 2015 at $2.43, a very strong performance. On a GAAP basis diluted EPS was $2.61 and $2.41 for the full year of 2016 and 2015 respectively. Orders for the quarter were at $1.669 billion, a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $349 million in the fourth quarter or approximately 146% of net income. And for the full year operating cash flow was also a record $1.78 billion or approximately 129% of net income. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $929 million at the end of the year. Inventory days were 76, down three days compared to December of last year. Accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion at the end of December and day sales outstanding was 73 days, up approximately two days from December of 2015. Accounts payable was $678 million at the end of the year and payable days was 55, up approximately one day compared to December of last year. The cash flow from operations of $349 million in the quarter, along with commercial paper borrowings of $37 million and stock option proceeds of $38 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $96 million of the company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $51 million, to fund dividend payments of $43 million, and to fund acquisitions of approximately $32 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $181 million net of translation. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.5 million shares, completing our January 2015 stock repurchased plan of 10 million shares. The company\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized it\u2019s a new two year stock repurchase program, to repurchase up to $1 billion of the company\u2019s common stock commencing in January of 2017. At December 31st, cash and short-term investments were $1.2 billion and the majority of which is held outside the U.S. At year-end the company had issued $1 billion under its commercial paper program and the company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion at December 31st. Total debt at December 31st was approximately $3 billion and net debt was approximately $1.8 billion. And the fourth quarter 2016 EBITDA was approximately $403 million, bringing full year EBITDA to $1.465 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and a strong finish to a great year. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I wanted to make a couple of comments relative to our sales guidance for the first quarter and full year \u201817. Our guidance reflects an organic growth rate excluding all acquisitions and currency impacts of 1% to 4% in the first quarter of \u201817 and 1% to 3% for the full year of 2017. In addition the guidance reflects the benefit of our recently announced acquisitions, as well as offsetting native effects of current FX rates versus 2016, particularly the weakening of euro, renminbi and the pound. This results in a U.S. dollar growth rate of 3% to 6% for the first quarter of \u201817 and 1% to 3% for the full year of 2017. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I would like to add my welcome to all of you on the phone and particularly like to wish you all a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year 2016 and most importantly I\u2019ll walk you through the progress across our various served markets. Then finally I will take a few moments to comment on our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017 and as Craig mentioned we will have time for questions at the end. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than we had expected, as Craig mentioned we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and earnings and we reached new records in sales, EPS and operating margins. Our sales in the quarter grew 15% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies and that reached a new record in the quarter of $1.651 billion. Craig alluded to the orders which were very robust nearly $1.669 billion and that was a book-to-bill of 1.01 to 1. In particularly we\u2019re very pleased with the profitability in the quarter and that new high of 20.5% certainly represents a great achievement for the company. Cash flow is very strong in the quarter, $349 million and I think all of these results really confirm the company\u2019s financial strength. I can just say as we end the fourth quarter how proud I am of our team. Our results in the quarter once again reflect the true value of both the discipline and the agility of this entrepreneurial Amphenol organization. Who has continued to perform very well despite the many dynamics in the worldwide economy and all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company. We are very pleased in the quarter that we closed on another outstanding acquisition, just recently in last couple of weeks during January. Phitek Systems Limited, it\u2019s a New Zealand base provider of high technology interconnects solutions that are used in in-flight entertainment and passenger connectivity for the commercial air market. Phitek has annual sales of approximately $20 million. One thing, we are really excited about with Phitek is that they develop their products together with in-flight equipment manufacturers and aeroplane builders, but also directly with airlines around the world and that represents an outstanding complement to Amphenol\u2019s already broad array of products for commercial air applications. We are really excited to welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol and with that acquisition we remain very confident that our overall acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. It is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities while successfully bringing them into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now, 2016 as a full year I think was just really outstanding year for the company, we expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies, reaching new sales record of $6.286 billion. Our full year adjusted operating margins reached 19.8%, which was an excellent achievement given the initially lower margins of FCI, which as you know we acquired back in the early part of January 2016. And that strong profitability enabled us to generate EPS in the year on an adjusted basis of $2.72, which grew 12% from prior year. Our acquisition program in 2016 contributed significantly to our performance. First and foremost we closed on the largest acquisition in our history FCI. We're extremely pleased with the results of FCI in their first year as part of the Amphenol family. In fact, what I\u2019m most pleased about is how the FCI team has truly embraced Amphenol's performance culture and thereby has been able to drive outstanding improvements in their operating performance, And that has resulted in a contribution of $0.19 per share to EPS in 2016, well in excess of our original expectations, which you may recall back in January we expected about $0.12 of accretion for the company. In addition to this great operating performance FCI has also solidified its position with customers across its many served markets and geographies. And in particular has made significant progress working collaboratively across Amphenol to expand our total company's collective technology and market strength. In addition to the acquisition of FCI in 2016, you\u2019ll recall that we also acquired Auxel, Custom Cable, SGF Sensor Tech and All Systems Broadband as well as Phitek just here in January of 2017. These excellent acquisitions are already creating significant value for the company and really most importantly we've now been joined by a great range of talented individuals around the world with these companies. And that is really deepened our talent bench across an already impressive management team. As we company think about the company long-term, our long-term mission remains to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. It's very simple mission and through the organic development efforts of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, together with the benefits of our acquisition program we've been able to expand our partnerships with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets. And this has ultimately resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. While the overall market environment in 2016 remained uncertain and there were no doubt many dynamics in the world. As we enter 2017 our management team is highly confident that we've build a platform of strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just note at the beginning here that as we closed 2016 we're really proud of the company's balanced and broad market diversification. In fact even with the significant activity end of last year in our acquisition program, we're very pleased that no market this year exceeded 21% of our sales for the full year. And this diversification has really two great values; first it insulates us from individual market volatility. But at the same time it also exposes us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And we think this really creates great long-term value for the company. We're also pleased that in 2016 many of our markets realized strong above industry organic growth rates. So turning to the specific markets, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full year. Sales were up strongly in the fourth quarter rising by a bit better than expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. As we recovered from the earlier DLA stopped shipment while also capitalizing on stronger sales of products that go into communications, ordinance and military vehicle applications. Sequentially our sales increased by a very robust 12%. For the full year of 2016, we're very pleased that despite the impact of DLA stopped shipment that was received in the first quarter, our military sales this year grew by 4% both in U.S. dollars and organically. And that just reflected strong organic performance in many segments of the market. I'm very proud of our military team as they have driven the strong performance in 2016, while also managing through what was no doubt a challenging regulatory issue. In fact at the end of the day we have strengthened our overall market position through a long-term and consistent strategy of offering our customers the broadest range of leading technologies for their next generation equipment requirement. Looking ahead while we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from these fourth quarter levels, we do anticipate achieving low to mid-single digit sales growth in the military market for the full year 2017. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down from prior year by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies as procurement and support of certain new airplane platforms did moderate from prior year. Sequentially our sales in the quarter were flat to the third quarter. For the full year 2016 our sales were slightly down in U.S. dollars and flat in local currencies, as the impact from the DLA issue together with the continued moderation in demand for helicopters and business jets offset growth that was associated with new passenger airplane platforms. We are really excited that the acquisition of Phitek broadened both our product offering as well as our customer relationships. We now have an excellent range of high technology interconnect solutions for the important area of passenger entertainment and comfort, together with these new direct relationships with airlines around the world. Looking into 2017, we expect sales in the commercial air market to increase from these levels in the first quarter and for the full year we expect sales to increase in the mid to high single-digit as we benefit from the addition of Phitek while also realizing further organic growth from our strong position on new jet liner. The industrial market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and also 18% for the full year of 2016. Sales in this market grew by 22% in the fourth quarter in U.S. dollar and 3% organically as we benefited from the contributions from our acquisition, which included especially FCI, together with organic growth in the heavy equipment, factory automation, industrial instrumentation and medical markets. Sequentially our sales in the industrial market grew by a stronger than expected to 6% in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, our sales grew by 20% in U.S. dollar and 2% organically, and this was driven by a benefit from our acquisition program, as well as strength in hybrid bus and truck, factory automation and heavy equipment, which were offset by still meaningful sales declines in oil and gas, as well as some moderation in the alternative energy applications. We are very pleased with our progress in the diversified global industrial market. We now have a wider range of interconnect and sensor product across a broader array of exciting segment. In addition, we\u2019ve made further progress expanding into new areas of the industrial market both organically and through acquisition, including in particular with FCI\u2019s strong position in embedded computing. We look forward to realizing the benefits from these expansion efforts for many years in the future. We anticipate sales in the first quarter to moderate slightly from these levels and for the full year 2017 we expect low to mid-single digit growth from the industrial market as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions, as well as our organic growth efforts. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year and sales increased very strong 14% in U.S. dollar, 16% in local currencies and 12% organically in the quarter. As we continue to make just great progress penetrating a wide array of applications and new electronic systems with car markers around the world. Sequentially our automotive sales increased by 3% in U.S. dollar and 5% in local currencies. For the full year 2016, we grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, a clear reflection of the company\u2019s ongoing progress in expanding our position across the global automotive market. We\u2019re pleased in particular that we were able to grow organically in all regions around the world in 2016. Our automotive business continues to benefit from the consistent strategy, which is very simply expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically as well as through our acquisition program to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufactures around the world. Looking into 2017, for the first quarter we expect sales to remain roughly at current levels, but for the full year we expect to achieve sales growth in the mid to high single-digit. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from our successful automotive business long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our performance in the fourth quarter was a bit weaker than anticipated as sales were down by 27% from prior year and 19% sequentially. This significant moderation in demand resulted from slower sales in particular of products incorporated into tablets, smartphones as well production related accessories. Offset impart by increased sales of products used in new wearable technologies. Once again I got to give a lot of credit to our team who demonstrated really impressive agility in the quarter as they were able to flex their resources quickly in the phase of this substantial sequential reduction in sales. For the full year 2016 our sales to the mobile device market declined by 15% from prior year with the largest reductions in tablet related products. Despite this very challenging year in the very dynamic mobile devices market our team did a fantastic job in securing strong operating performance in the year, while at the same time positioning the company for the future through their development of exciting new interconnect and antenna products for a wide array of next generation mobile computing platforms. As we look into this year and into the first quarter, we expect a sequential reduction in the first quarter of sales of approximately 20% due to the typical seasonality that we see in the market. And at this point for the full year 2017 we expect our sales to be flat from 2016. Without a doubt, though I can tell you that our team will remain poise to capitalize on any opportunities that may arise in the market to drive ultimately stronger performance in our mobile devices business. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter and as well 9% for the full year 2016. Sales grew from prior year by a stronger than expected 29% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. This was due to contributions from the FCI acquisition, as well as our excellent organic progress in our sales to both OEMs and mobile network service providers. Sequentially our sales increased by 6% in what is almost always a seasonally softer fourth quarter that really reflects the great progress that we made in the market. For the full year 2016 we achieved strong growth of 24% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically and that is despite a market that is no doubt remained very uncertain. We\u2019re very pleased that our long-term efforts to expand our high technology position with both mobile equipment manufacturers, as well as service providers around the world has paid real dividends here in 2016. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on that strength in the future. Looking ahead there remain significant uncertainty in the spending plans of wireless operators around the world and accordingly we expect our sales to moderate in the first quarter and for the full year 2017 we expect sales to remain roughly at 2016 levels. But even though we don\u2019t at this time expect the overall spending environment to improve our broaden product offering positions us better than ever before to capitalize on opportunities that will no doubt continue to arise in the long-term future. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year 2016. Sales are stronger than expected in the fourth quarter in IT datacom rising by a very significant 66% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically really an excellent performance by our team. Organically we grew really in all segments of the IT datacom market. So we\u2019re especially pleased with our accelerating progress of our sales into new web service providers, the sort of next generation customers. Sequentially our sales increased by 3% from the third quarter. For the full year 2016 we\u2019re very excited to have achieved 45% growth in U.S. dollars and a very strong 11% growth organically in IT datacom. This organic growth is a real credit to our team\u2019s efforts to develop leading technologies, while rapidly pivoting towards opportunities for growth that are being created by the many new customers in the IT market. Looking into 2017 while we do anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of sales in the first quarter, we expect to achieve mid-single digit sales growth for the full year 2017. I can tell you that both our traditional as well as our new customers in the IT datacom market continue to upgrade their data center equipment to reach new levels of performance and that performance is really necessary as they all seek to do with the rapid expansion of data traffic that\u2019s driven in particular by the continuing spread of IP video, as well as by the accelerating adoption of cloud based computing around the world. Amidst this real dramatic technology shift we\u2019re really excited by our great progress in the IT market. With the acquisition of FCI together with the acquisition of FCI together with the other acquisitions we made this year such as Auxel and Custom Cable. We've significantly expanded our range of high speed, power, value add and other interconnect products for a broad array of applications in IT datacom. And we're now positioned stronger than ever in this very important market. The broadband communications market represented 6% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year of 2016. Sales in this market were up 15% in U.S. dollars and up slightly organically in what is typically a seasonally softer fourth quarter. Sequentially our sales increased by 2% really with the contributions from All Systems Broadband that we completed in the third quarter. So looking across the full year of 2016, we're very pleased with our performance. We grew 10% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically in broadband. And that reflected our further progress in diversifying our broadband product offering into new high technology value add interconnect solutions, while continuing to expand our positions with customers around the world. For the first quarter we expect the slight increase of sales from the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2017 we look forward to achieving low double-digit growth as we benefit from our recent acquisition and also capitalize on our continued efforts to develop new products for broadband operators around the world. So just to sum up our performance here in the fourth quarter in 2016, I can just simply say how proud I am of our performance and of our team. While there remain many dynamics in the global economy, the Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well. In particular our dual pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in Amphenol expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance. The company's superior performance is really a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with a broad array of customers across diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to the outlook, based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment, as well as on constant exchange rates. We now expect for the first quarter and the full year 2017 the following results. For the first quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.535 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% to 7% in local currency and an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 10% to 14%. For the full year 2017 we expect sales in the range of $6.340 billion to $6.5 billion and EPS in the range of $2.84 to $2.92 respectively. For the full year this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1% to 3% and 4% to 7% over 2016 levels. I can just say that we're all very encouraged by the continued strong performance of Amphenol in 2016 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward into the future even given the many dynamics around the world. I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our new levels of revenues and earnings and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position, while also expanding our profitability. At this point operator we'd be very happy to take any questions if there maybe. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. As per the company's request please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question would come from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Hey thanks. I have a question and a follow up, I guess first off congrats on a really good year again to you guys. Adam, when I look at the full year guide you\u2019re looking at about 2% organic growth, could you just help me understand because all the end markets you went through I think the worst you talked about was a flat assumption for the most were up low to high single-digits. Just help me what's the context for the 2% organic growth when it would appear that a lot of your peers a lot of the semiconductor guys as a somewhat more positive end demand trends. One of the subtractions that you see that we should be cognizant about. Adam Norwitt : Well thank you very much Amit. Look, I think I went through the various markets and you mentioned it right away that we do expect mobile to be flat. And I think we have a few other markets where I mentioned single-digit or low single-digit growth. And at the end of the day the guidance that we have given represents our outlooks sitting here today in the third or fourth week of January looking out over what we expect for the year. I think it is still a market that remains uncertain, so we remain very poise to capitalize on any opportunities that may come our way. And so, again as we sit here and look out over the next 12 months, for us we think this is a very prudent guidance and appropriate guidance given the markets that we see. But we\u2019ll remain very capable and eager to capitalize on any other opportunities. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And if I could just follow-up, on the EPS guidance I appreciate the FX discussion you guys had on revenues. Could you just help me think about how much is FX and commodity headwind for you guys in the March and 2017 guidance that\u2019s embedded in the numbers you outlined today? Craig Lampo : Sure, from an FX perspective we see certainly we talked about that in my prepared remarks in regards to the \u201817 guidance that there is certainly was some strengthening of the dollar that had some impact of offsetting the positive impact of acquisitions and more specifically they impact of the dollar strengthening in \u201817 versus the average \u201816 rate was roughly 2% I would say, which reflect -- which is reflected in the kind of our current guidance. So that really is the FX impact on the full year and it\u2019s not so much different for the first quarter. In regards to commodities, we certainly as we have kind of talked about this before there certainly has been recent increases of some sizes in certain commodities in particular copper, it\u2019s difficult to say what the impact will be in the future. But as we have said before the ultimate impact really depends on the balance of the input cost and the pricing environment and that balance tends to kind of somewhat depend on demand levels. So I think there is certainly some risk by the additional inflationary pressures could provide some pressure from a commodity perspective, but I think our strong entrepreneurial management team will keep a close eye on all these input cost and do their best to balancing capitalize on any opportunities and minimize any cost increases and whatever to maximize the profitability of the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes thanks, good afternoon guys. Just a question regarding FCI as you pointed out Adam more creative than you thoughts did a great job of integrating that. So it sounds like in terms of incremental cost savings that\u2019s kind of played out, but as you look at cross selling opportunities particularly in your the datacom market, industrial and then also through distribution, where are we there in terms of opportunities for incremental growth? Adam Norwitt : Yes well thank you very much, Matt. You\u2019re absolutely correct, we are very happy with the performance improvements of FCI and whether those are cost savings or pricing discipline whatever it is, as you know to us profit is price minus cost and I think the team has really embraced that very comprehensive approach to profit improvement without just saying well we\u2019re going to improve one light item here or there. They really did embrace the Amphenol approach to it which is look everything is up for grab here and let\u2019s just make the bottom-line perform better and a lot of credit to the FCI management team. The people who were there before and who are there still today, in terms of the cross selling, I\u2019ll tell you when I look at the markets where FCI has a significant presence and I look at our overall performance, this year even from an organic perspective take a market like a IT datacom, where we obviously had very, very strong performance here in the fourth quarter, 27% organic growth, with 11% organic growth on a full year basis. I can tell you that I would take some portion of that some impact of that has come from the fact that together with FCI we have today really the broadest offering into that market, the leading technology, the best footprint to support customers wherever they maybe in the world and without being able to pinpoint what a number would be I can tell you that they have had already a positive impact really in that important market, which was for them really a very significant market. And the same when I look at our performance in a wireless infrastructure up 10% organically in the quarter, up 9% for the full year, certainly a higher level of performance than we had anticipated coming into 2016 and there again without being able to pinpoint an exact arithmetic impact that they had I think we have had clearly benefits inside of Amphenol on having had them. As it relates to distribution, there is no doubt about it that our relationship with distributors today is a broader more strategic relationship across multiple markets than it was in the past. I mean you know well Matt our legacy in distribution, which comes from our harsh environment Millero [ph] and industrial products we were never traditionally viewed as a core partner in the IT datacom market and in those types of connectors, which in addition are being repackaged into embedded computing in the industrial market. And I can tell you today whole heartedly that that has changed. And what will be the benefits for that? Sometimes those benefits take a while to leach in to the relationship in terms of actually selling through and accelerating the sell through. But no question that already our seat at the table with these distributors is more significant than it has been in the past. And I would expect and be very confident that long-term that will deliver a good results for the company. Matt Sheerin : Okay great. And just as a follow-up just quickly regarding the guidance on mobility to be flat for the year, but down 20% sequentially implies that you're going to be down year-over-year to start the year. So are you expecting it to be more backend loaded where you've got some visibility perhaps into new program ramps in the back half? Adam Norwitt : Yes I think your math is correct. I think we do expect in the first quarter to be down a bit year-over-year and that would imply that later in the year we would be up. And as always we forecast on the basis of what we see today, this is a market that is one of the least visible markets and in fact as the single least visible markets that we have to give guidance on. You will remember that I'm not very good at giving guidance in this market two years ago I guided it flat and we were up 13% and last year I guided flat and we were down 15%. I am hopeful that I will be closer to the former than the latter this year, but right now what we see is that it will be flat. The 20% or so down that we see here in the first quarter is actually a little bit less than it was down last year. You'll remember that in Q1 of last year we were down something around 32%, 33% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Now obviously we're down from a lower level because we were down quite significantly on a year-over-year basis so that doesn't -- shouldn't surprise anybody. But it is very normal in that market that you have year-end where there is a little bit stronger second half that is little bit stronger and that's what happened this year. If we look at our second half performance in 2016 we were still up in kind of the mid-teens compared to the first half. But that compares to a prior year where we were up by a more significant amount. And I think our guidance right now would imply that our second half would be up a bit more compared to our first half than we saw here in 2016. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Hi, afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Shawn. Shawn Harrison : Just the mobile networks business, kind of I think it beat almost every quarter your expectations as 2016 progressed. Maybe if you could just talk about regionally where the upside came from exiting the year and maybe why you can't see growth again in 2017? Craig Lampo : No, I think you're correct. Forget us in the first quarter we would beat, but I think we basically beat throughout the course of the year. And no doubt about it as we look at the full year and our performance we did not anticipate to perform at the levels that we did here for the full year. If we just look at the quarter and for the year from a regional perspective, we did grow in the quarter organically in every region, but I would tell you that our strongest performance in the fourth quarter was in Europe. We had really excellent performance and that was both with OEMs as well as with operators. So interconnect products as antennas that we sell in the mobile networks market. And we feel really good about that, it's not necessarily the most robust spending environment in Europe. And I think our team did a great job. On a full year basis again Europe was the leader in our overall performance growing quite robustly on an organic basis. So I think that was really excellent really opportunity that we were able to capitalize upon to grow, which we didn't necessarily coming into the year. I think as we sit here today we can only look at the spending outlook of our customers. And all what we have heard from either from reading that publically or from otherwise interacting with the customers is that it looks to be a relatively muted spending environment this year. There is not big new systems being built 5G is probably still a little bit on the horizon. And so that\u2019s where we stand today. All that things said, just like I said with mobile device this is a market where sometimes that figure can get turned on when you least expect it. And it\u2019s important for us as an organization to be poised and ready and part of being poised and ready here is having done the work with our product development to make sure that we have the right products for the next generation systems that our customers are ultimately going to invest in. And that extends from connectors of all types to value add, interconnect assemblies all the way to the antennas. And so our teams have done a really outstanding job over the last couple of years making sure that we are really in a leadership position from a technology perspective. And we believe that to the extent that there is spending that\u2019s maybe unexpected in 2017 wherever it maybe that we\u2019ll be there is really the first phone call for those customers in order to help them manage through the build outs that they need to have. The thing that I have talked about in this market for so long is the fact that you have a kind of unstoppable march upward of the demand from consumers on the networks, the traffic in the networks. And whether that\u2019s me watching videos on my phone or my kids doing that or the coverage that remains in many geographies still very, very spotty there\u2019s no question that there is an accelerating demand really at the user level. How that ultimately translates to the capital spending patterns of the customers, it\u2019s not always really unlocks step units in as you know well they tend to have other reasons for deciding when they spend and when they don\u2019t spend. And thus it\u2019s just really important for us to be ready to be able to pivot quickly towards where the spending comes and to be able to capitalize upon that faster than our peers. And I think we did that this year and we\u2019ll remain poised to do that in the coming year. Shawn Harrison : And if I may one real quick follow-up to Adam, $1 billion buyback I think is largest you\u2019ve ever announced and typically you run through the entire authorization is that the expectation with this buyback over the next few years? Adam Norwitt : Sure, so actually just to correct you the largest buyback or at least roughly equals the buyback we did in 2011 where we bought roughly a billion over 2011 and 2012. And this certainly represents actually much smaller as a percentage of free cash flow than it did at that point. This does represent roughly 50% of our free cash flow return to shareholders including our dividend programs so this would be consistent with our capital deployment strategy where the other half of our free cash flow will be allocated towards M&A over the longer term. We certainly continue to have a thoughtful and balanced approach to that where we certainly look towards spending our free cash flow towards acquisition since we think that provides ultimately the best return of capital. But certainly our dividend program and stock buyback program are two important levers to our capital deployment strategy and we think that this share repurchase program really is going to be a great program to continue to have that balanced approach going forward and support that. Craig Lampo : I would just maybe add one thing Shawn I mean you asked does it get satisfied in two years, it\u2019s a two year plan, you know that we always keep flexibility and last year we made the biggest acquisition in our history and that was $1.2 billion that we spent on that acquisition. We have not announced another biggest acquisition in our history here. We will always prioritize acquisitions as the best use of capital for the company at the same time the company generates a lot of cash. So sitting here today it\u2019s a two year plan and we typically when we announced the length of a plan we would anticipate to use that plan, but it all depends ultimately on whether there is other attractive acquisition opportunities, which we would clearly prioritize. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thank you. I'm just following up on the comments on industrial was it a bit better than expected in Q4? We\u2019ve seen a few signs out there in terms of maybe a little bit of inflection understanding there is a number of sub-segments there any light you\u2019d shed on that in terms of kind of how you\u2019re feeling about that some of the broad based industrial businesses? Adam Norwitt : Yeah I think look industrial has -- fortunately for us industrial is a very diversified market and you mentioned it there\u2019s a lot of different segments of industrial and I think industrial have been in the last year real tail of two cities for us at least. Where you have certain areas and oil and gas has been one that everybody has talked about we have talked about it, it hasn\u2019t been great this year. Luckily it\u2019s less impactable than it was in prior year, but does that reach an refection because of the price of oil or does it reach an inflection simply because it\u2019s fallen quite a bit maybe some combination of the two. I think you\u2019ve got other areas that over the course of the year have been maybe a little more challenged in places like alternative energy various [indiscernible] regions around the world and conversely we\u2019ve had some areas that have done really well we\u2019ve mentioned before like the battery and HEV market the real hybrid bus and truck areas. We talked about our strength in medical and we actually had very good performances here in heavy equipment, factory automation and thankfully we are very, very diversified across that industrial market. Now as it relates to an inflection or a potential inflection in industrial there has been a lot talk about infrastructure, and will there be kind of an infrastructure at least investments that will be made in our country and we are certainly big proponents of that if it would come. We have not guided in our guidance here towards any political changes, let\u2019s say that because I think it still early days and whether or not the fiscal policies of this country and the others are going to change. They may impact change, but how they are going to change I think is still up for the question. But to the extent that there was a significant infrastructure expansion and you can bet our strong position that we have with customers who themselves may benefit from any infrastructure we would clearly benefit from that as well or we would certainly fight to benefit from it. As we look into 2017 in addition I\u2019d tell you that on a global basis we feel very good about that position whether that's in Europe or North America or Asia. In Asia our team has just done a fabulous job of really expanding our local presence there both from a manufacturing, design and ultimately sales support for the customers. And as Asia is really moving in certain directions and North America is moving in other directions we have these local teams who are going to capitalize upon that. Our industrial business today is a broader set of technologies than it has ever been and that's in particular because of the arrival of FCI. What FCI brought to us is a range of products that are really used in embedded computing and if you see just the revolution that is happening in embedded computing, we feel very confident that long-term we\u2019ll be able to realize more benefits from that than we would have been to do had we not acquired FCI. And so I think that's another piece of the industrial market that we\u2019re very hopeful about long-term. Now look sitting today without any presumption of an infrastructure expansion, I would tell you that the industrial market is still a very mixed market across those many segments and -- but again we remain poised to capitalize if there is something that is more uplifting. Craig Hettenbach : Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the sensor market understanding it\u2019s a relatively newer market for you, but just kind of as you look at the M&A potential landscape and then just look from an organic development perspective how things are going out with sensors? Adam Norwitt : We are really excited about sensors, we just finished our third year owning a sensor company it was just three years ago last December that we acquired the GE Advanced Sensors business. I\u2019ll tell you that the team is doing really well on two fronts not just the GE team that joined us but also the cast CASCO and then most recently SGX. Number one, the operating performance of those companies has really done fabulously and I would tell you that they have met the challenge let\u2019s say of the peer pressure that exist within Amphenol to not perform below the company average and that\u2019s been a really great success for that team. But in addition I think they have done a great job of driving stronger performance in their own business while also capitalizing on the collaborative technology efforts that exist within Amphenol. Our sensor business had a good year last year, it performed I think very well, we grew in the market organically and otherwise and I think that we will continue to pursue opportunity to grow both organically as well as through acquisition. I think the fact that we\u2019ve made three acquisitions in three years is not too bad, but we are certainly thirsty for more growth opportunities both inorganic and organic in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks gentlemen. If you look at the stock market and Amphenol's performance since November both have done very well. And there seems to be an expectation based on infrastructure spending a lower corporate tax rate sort of a general positive environment for businesses that things are going to get better. I wanted to see if you could give us some sense of what you're hearing from your customers. We have sort of guidance that you've given us, but are your customers feeling better about spending. And then along with that, can you maybe give us some sense of the implications of the border tax adjustment that the new government has been talking about? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure well happy new year and thank you very much Sherri. Look I've talked to a lot of customers since November 8th or 9th whenever it all came out. And I can tell you that customers are very curious. They are thinking a lot about this, but nobody really knows ultimately what new fiscal or other policies are going to come about whether those are tax or trade or infrastructure spending or regulatory reductions. I mean look, I think you -- there will be change, and I think some of that change will be positive for business and some of that change maybe negative for business. And the question is only how do you as a company react and manage through that change. And there I believe we are really well positioned, because regardless of what new policies may come. The agility that is really just second nature and integral to Amphenol is something that in times of change creates great value. So if you have border adjusted taxes or if you have tariffs or whatever I mean we have a footprint that is extremely flexible that is aligned to where our customers want to be. And something that we will manage through whether it's good or bad. I think a lot of customers I will tell you have asked me personally, hey what if we had to make this and that in a different geography? And the answer that I'm always able to give them in a very clear way is look we have a footprint regardless that is very strong in all geographies. And we continue to be a significant manufacturer in the United States for example and we have outstanding people and outstanding organizations here. And so if somebody in the end wants to make consumer products in the U.S. for whatever reason, then we'll be right there next to them to support them. And in many ways in some of our markets our competitors aren't necessarily the traditional U.S. companies that you all follow in such an instance I would think we would have an advantage over some of those companies. And that's in particular true in things like consumer devices whatever they maybe. But look, we're not going to try to sit here and guess what policies are. We'll stay well with rest of them and we'll be able to react in pivot if necessarily on a very, very rapid basis to either capitalize upon or deal with whatever policies may come our way. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Sherri. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes thank you. Adam in your press release in your guidance section you note the dynamics, uncertainty around the dynamics related to potential government policy changes as part of the reason for maybe somewhat cautionary conservative guidance. But could you elaborate maybe what would be some of the policy changes that you see as most material for Amphenol or maybe help us think through how you're handicapping this risk? And I have a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Yes I mean I think I just talked a little bit about this Wamsi. And I wouldn't sort of rank or handicap specific policies that have been talked about. I think nobody knows what policies are ultimately going to be reflected. And I would just reiterate that regardless of what policies come our way we're going to be well poised to deal with them. And there is lots of categories of these policies whether that's tax or trade or infrastructure or other fiscal measures. And whatever it is we'll very adeptly deal with them and we'll applaud those that are really favorable for us and for our customers. I mean look ultimately we're a global company. We may be headquartered here in Cloudy Walling for today. But I can tell you that we are a global company. We support customers on a global basis, we manufacture on a global basis and our people work on a global basis. At the same time we're very local company. And so in many ways when we support a local market we do that in a very local fashion. And so I think that whatever happens in any geography, everybody is talking about this geography where we're sitting today. But who knows whether there won\u2019t be changes in other geographies that ultimately impact us and other global companies. And so it\u2019s hard to just pin down the ones that maybe in the paper today without reflecting on what maybe other countries may do, what other policies may come in tandem with us to make that handicapping. I think that is a tough handicapping to do, the best we will do and the best we can do is to just stay very, very well addressed of it and to remain as agile as we have even been before to deal with whatever comes our way. Wamsi Mohan : And Adam just a follow-up on that, I mean you think that the agility that you have like tremendously displayed here over a very long period of time, if there was incremental production that most of the U.S. do feel that Amphenol can maintain that agility particularly some of that agility pertains to labor flexibility in some of the other geographies? Adam Norwitt : So look, let me give you a near-term example of this Wamsi. I mean you know and we have talked about the DLA issue that we had. As part of that DLA issue that required a very rapid resourcing of certain components in this country and we did that extraordinarily, our team did that with a number of products that you can\u2019t imagine I mean the number of different individual part numbers and the number of different qualifications that were required and all of that the flexibility in the manufacturing locations, our team went through that with such flying colors and I think you see that reflected in the fact that even with that significant issue, we are able to grow our military business 4% organically this year. And I think that\u2019s just a snapshot of how we deal when there are changes that come. And so we have an outstanding footprint of extraordinarily capable people in the United States period and to the extent that there are policies that either incent us or force us to move production to wherever in the world, I can just tell you that this team is going to do a great job to handle that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open. James Suva : Thank you very much. You talked a lot about the upward onward march connectors nearly being connected in electronification and everything. But the guidance generally flattish sales doesn\u2019t really connects with that, no plan intended and if you look back historically you haven\u2019t had such a modest growth basically for years and years and last year you have some acquisitions that kind of came in mid-year which should help. So is it conservatism or that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting from customers or I am just trying to bridge the comments with the actual guidance? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure, well thanks very much Jim. I mean look our guidance this year from an organic perspective is actually a little bit higher than our organic guidance was last year. So I think from that perspective I would just point that out, it\u2019s true we had the benefits of the FCI acquisition in particular we made a few other acquisitions during the course of the year that weren\u2019t envisioned in our original guidance last year. But I think it is too early to say that the economy on a broad basis is in a full recovery, and I think I went through each of that markets, I highlighted in particular our mobile devices market where we think it\u2019s a little too early to see growth, the same with mobile networks where at this point we think it\u2019s an uncertain spending environment. But I would just say that thank goodness for the diversification of the company and the fact that we have that diverse balance in the company can also have once in a while an impact. We have some markets that are growing very fabulously, if those markets were 100% of our sales, obviously you would have higher organic growth, but than you would have a volatility on the year-end that we don\u2019t think would be appropriate for the company or for our investors. The way we create our forecast is the same way that we always have, which is we take a real bottoms up approach to looking at what our operations tell us and the operations are telling us numbers that they get from their customers and then we of course will apply some judgment here at headquarters. And I don\u2019t think this process has changed at all, except that I would take from last year to this year we have slightly higher outlook for organic growth and we don\u2019t the impact of the large FCI acquisition. But I would not say that this is a market shift in our outlook long-term for the business in fact we see it today still a very, very favorable long-term opportunity for Amphenol. As you say the kind of ongoing upward march and the proliferation of electronics across really all aspects of the industry, we see that as continuing over the long-term. And we think our company remains very poised to capitalize on that long-term trend. James Suva : Thank you very much. Adam Norwitt : Thanks Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks, I was going to stay away from the economic policy questions and I just couple of product questions if I could. So first of all you mentioned in your prepared remarks Adam antenna is going into your auto market. I was just curious if you could just provide a little bit of color around that and what trends you're benefiting from and how you're differentiating yourself? And then just as a follow-up if you could give us a little bit more sense in Europe as to whether you're doing better on the connector side or -- rather the antenna side or the connector side in terms of your revenues most recently? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : And sorry on the Europe, do you mean in automotive or do you mean? Steven Fox : Sorry in mobile network, you mentioned\u2026 Adam Norwitt : Mobile network. That's I assumed you meant mobile network. Well look, just with respect to automotive I did mentioned I mean today still interconnect products are biggest portion of our sales in the automotive market and that's a broad array of interconnect products not just discrete connectors, but real value add interconnect systems. And that\u2019s something that we've been focused on for a very long time. In addition we've build now a very robust business in automotive sensors. And we've been focused on expanding our antenna capabilities from where originally came which is the device as well as the mobile infrastructure and expanding that core technology into automotive where we see a real expansion and a proliferation of connectivity in the cars. And some of that connectivity is with connectors and some of that connectivity is through the air with antennas. And I think our team has just done a really outstanding job here in positioning ourselves. We have a number of new design wins, some of which are already going into production and others of which will come, will roll on over the coming quarters and years. We have really established ourselves or let me say beginning to establish ourselves as a player in an area where we really weren't in the past, which is automotive antennas. And I think when you couple our deep-deep expertise in radio frequency what we call RF technology together with a broader antenna -- a broader automotive presence than we've ever had before, that's a really good recipe to find a new lever for growth over the long-term. Now we also know that automotive cycles aren't just every few months or every few quarters it's really every few years. And so it does take time to get the wins and then to have those wins ultimately roll on into a mass production. But I'm hopeful that we'll start to see some of the benefit of that in the near-term. And I think we have even a little bit of benefit of that in our outlook for 2017. As it relates to our mobile network sales in particular in Europe as you mentioned. I'd say it was actually kind of balanced in the quarter between our progress with OEMs, which is more interconnect products and our progress with service providers, which is tends to be a bit more antenna. And I'd say a bit more because we are selling in addition interconnect products and other accessories directly to operators. But there is a more significance of antenna sales to operators. So I wouldn\u2019t say it was really out of balance probably relatively balanced, which drove that good performance in Europe. Steven Fox : Great, that's very helpful. Good luck going forward. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. First question is a follow-up on mobile devices. You mentioned some of the reasons it was down in the fourth quarter, but can you talk if at all end market related to unit sales or was there anything driven in terms of your market share or pricing that caused the decline? And then as you think about mobile devices in 2017 you alluded some opportunities in the second half of the year, could you just elaborate on the types of products be it antennas or connectors and what sort of end devices you think drive that pickup in the second half of '17? Adam Norwitt : Yes sure, well thanks very much Mark. I think with respect to 2016 I highlighted that we saw in the year probably the most significant reductions in demand came on tablet computers. And I will tell you that that came sort of over the course of the year. We actually had a pretty good first quarter in tablets. But over the course of the year those sales dropped off a fair bit. And I don't think that's highly inconsistent with overall tablet units. I mean maybe some of the tablet units even had a little bit lower content, we talked about that a number of years ago where sometimes there\u2019s a little bit of mix shift the types of functionalities in the tablets whether those are full sort of mobile network tablets or whether they are Wi-Fi based. So I\u2019d say that the vast majority of the impact in particular on tablets, which was the bigger impact for us was really related to units and I think there is next year because Q1 this year had a little bit more strength in tablets, there\u2019s a little bit of a carryover impact into 2017 on the tablets. So we would expect tablets to still be a little bit drag on performance going into 2017. I think conversely I mentioned we\u2019ve had good performance and we continue to have good performance in wearables where there\u2019s just a lot of new devices there and some of those devices are just really innovative and challenging and as you know we\u2019ve always talked about the fact that when the hardware gets challenging that\u2019s where we get to add more value into our customers and where we\u2019re able to bring our innovation capabilities to our customers to enable them to fit more into that more challenging package that wearable represents. So I think that\u2019s been a strong point in 2016 and would continue to be such in 2017. As it relates to phones I think that we\u2019ve always said that on every phone we don\u2019t always have content on every phone, we don\u2019t always have the same content on every platform and that remains the case. And so it really depends on individual platforms and we try to win everything, but I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re 100% successful in winning absolutely everything. And so there are some platforms where we have good content and others where we don\u2019t and that can sometimes have an impact in the course of a year. In the more sort of laptops and next generation mobile computing I think we\u2019ve done a really excellent job there. It was sort of performing a little bit better in 2016 than the average, but not necessarily contributing to the overall and I think as we look forward into 2017 certainly we would expect the laptops, ultra books, whatever you call them to perform at a better rate than tablets. I think you\u2019ve seen that the functionality being embedded in computers is a little bit chewing on the market of tablets as they get smaller and more functional and more connected. You don\u2019t necessarily always need to also have a tablet. My anecdote is always when we meet investors to sort of take account and see who has what devices and I think the arc of tablets I have seen where everyone of you just uses a tablet and I can tell you just over the recent months and quarters I have seen a few more laptops popping up in the room and I think our performance is probably consistent with that. Mark Delaney : That\u2019s very helpful I appreciate all the color. A follow-up question on margins, I think the incremental margin guidance implied in the 2017 outlook is towards the low end of the historical 20% to 30% drop through rate on EBITDA margins, I think maybe there\u2019s some mixed benefits as maybe U.S. in mobile on a percentage of revenue next year, but you did talk about some of the FX headwinds and maybe some metal headwinds. So what would it take to do more toward the midpoint or higher end of the historical drop through levels on EBIT margins for 2017? Adam Norwitt : So actually I think that 2017 I'm not sure what math you\u2019re doing, but certainly 2017 is benefiting significantly from second half positive performance from FCI coming up to our average company operating margin levels. And that\u2019s going to bring into 2017, which is going to bring our overall year-over-year margins higher. But if you look at our base business that would also be converting at roughly our normal long-term rate, with long-term conversion targets around 25% as we\u2019ve said in the past and actually our drop through is roughly that that amount on kind of that base business. So I think we actually we feel we\u2019re converting pretty well going into 2017 and we\u2019re continuing to execute well. We had a great year in 2016. Throughout the year we increased our margins from I think Q1 to Q4 by something like 190 basis points and part a lot of that was FCI, creating step functions in their profitability, but some of that also was our base business and I think 2017 we still feel pretty good about. So anyways so I think that 2017 is going to be another good year from a profitability wise and we don\u2019t really see so much of a significant impact at least at this point from commodities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question would come from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. Adam regarding the recent acquisition, I think you noted that it affords you new relationships directly with the airlines themselves the carriers and I am hoping you can describe the benefit that you expect that to deliver to the business, does it mean faster revenue growth or more revenue stability or maybe some other financial benefit to the company. And maybe compare it specifically to what you\u2019ve learned by having that sort of exposure in the infrastructure market where you don\u2019t just sell to the infrastructure equipment OEMs, but you also as you have noted many times in the past, you sell directly to the telco carriers? Adam Norwitt : So thank you very much. Well, you correctly point out that I did allude to the fact that in addition to the Phitek\u2019s relationship with equipment makers and aeroplane builders they have really also direct relationship with airlines. And it\u2019s interesting in a few respect, I mean the reason they have that relationship is there are some airlines in the world who have actually decided that for them to be competitive, they want to create proprietary experiences, let\u2019s call it for their customers. And I think some of those big airlines around the world are well known, who have sort of unique experience that they offer to their passenger customers. And part of that experience can be ultimately the way that the customer interacts electronically with the plane. So whether that\u2019s the shape or configuration of the connectors or what functionality may very well be embedded in those connectors, if they just buy an off the shelf system an interface that supplied by a jet maker, well than all their competitors have equal access to that. And so I think there are a number of airlines who are moving in that direction. The most natural place to move in that direction is an in-flight entertainment or things like Wi-Fi connectivity, but who knows whether they won\u2019t in the end move more extensively in that direction. And when we think about the trajectory that we have seen in other markets towards service providers ultimately taking more charge of the customer experience and there by interfacing more with companies like us who help them to enable that customer experience. We have seen really quite some transformation, we saw that probably earliest in the mobile networks market like you alluded to, we have also more recently seen that in the IT datacom market where we have seen quite substantial growth coming from service providers where previously we really in that space only sold into the OEM market, we have seen that in fact in a few areas in the industrial market. For example, if you are working alternative energy sometimes it\u2019s not in a solar application for example, you are not just dealing with panel makers, but you\u2019re going directly to solar service providers and working with them on proprietary solutions that allow them to have more efficiency in their power generation plants. So I think that it is a trend that we have seen really across the industry, it doesn\u2019t mean at all by the way that we do that at the expense of those such chariest relationships that we have with our OEMs. I mean I think in fact it can help those relationships because we can be important with their customers as well as we can be supporting them immensely on their own initiatives. And that can be really a wonderful way to move from a transaction relationship to a real partnership relationship with those customers. I think that something that we haven\u2019t did seen within the mobile networks market, I think we see that a little bit emerging in the IT datacom market and some of the others that we referred too. So in the commercial air market short of maybe supplying some MRO materials for repairs and maintenance. In the past we haven\u2019t necessarily had that sort of upfront designing relationship with airlines whereby we\u2019re helping them create proprietary experiences and I think now we have that and we have the opportunity to benefit from that in the future. William Stein : Great, thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks Will. Operator : Thank you. Our last question would come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Hi, yes thanks for taking my follow-up. Adam now that you have lapped in year for FCI, how do you feel about another significantly large acquisition and if you could put that in the context of an environment where interest rates might rise and there might be disallowance of interest deductibility for taxes, would you pace for appetite for M&A any differently? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure thanks Wamsi. Look I mean we have just lapped our year with FCI. I will tell you exactly what I said a year ago when we acquired FCI, which is our criteria for acquisitions has always started number one with the people. We look for outstanding people who can really thrive in Amphenol's unique entrepreneurial environment and I can just tell you with FCI we check that box 100 times over. The second thing we look for is technology and real leading technology that can help enable our customers\u2019 products to work better. And then finally we look for market position that is complimentary. And I think in that case FCI ticked all of those boxes. A criteria that we have never talked about is size. And I think that the fact is FCI was the biggest one in our history we did also this year some smaller acquisition. So does FCI indicate that we change our approach to size, it doesn't because we have not changed our approach to size. If a significant acquisition came along, was available or otherwise was attractive we would not shy away from doing that. Now as it relates to the various fiscal policies or otherwise that you alluded to. I mean look, we'll react if those fiscal policies changed. Obviously if money gets more expensive for whatever reason either because of the face value of that money is more expensive or the net in your pocket value of that money is more expensive because of deductibility we\u2019ll react to that. But I think you also know if you follow our acquisition program over many, many years. We have always followed a very reasonable approach to valuations. We have not chased valuations because money is cheap nor have we run away from them when money is more expansive. We pay fair value for great companies and ultimately create a strong return on those chariest investments for us for the company and for the shareholders. And so I think that we're not just watching ticks up and ticks down in interest rate as we think about what the right price for acquisitions is going forward. And so look, whatever may come may come we continue to believe there is a lot of great companies that are out there. We have a very robust pipeline and to the extent that we're able to bring some of those in to the Amphenol family, we'll do so on fair terms as we always have. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks, Adam. Adam Norwitt : Very good. Well I think that was our last question and once again like to express our appreciation for all of your time here today. Wish you again a happy new year and look forward to seeing everybody or hearing from everybody at least just in about three months. Take care and have a great continuation. Craig Lampo : Thank you.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in listen-only-mode. At the request of the Company, this conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may now begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Craig Lampo and I am Amphenol\u2019s CFO. I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter conference call. Our first quarter 2017 results were just released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we\u2019ll have Q&A. We may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.560 billion and diluted EPS of $0.71, meeting the high end of the Company's guidance for sales and EPS by $25 million and $0.04 respectively. Sales were up 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2016. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisition and currency, sales in the first quarter increased 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 6% in U.S. dollar, local currency and organically. Bringing down sales into our two segments, our Cable segment which comprised 6% of our sales was up 16% from the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. The interconnect business, which comprise 94% of our sales, was up 7% in U.S. dollars from last year and was down 6% compared to last quarter. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minute. Operating income was $314 million for the first quarter, operating margin was 20.1% in the first quarter of \u201817 compared to the adjusted operating margin of 18.6% in the first quarter of '16, and down 40 basis points from the fourth quarter of \u201816 operating margin of 20.5%. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.2% in the first quarter compared to 13.3% last year. The 90 basis point increase over last reflects leverage on incremental volume. In the interconnect segment, margins increased to 22.1% in the first quarter compared to last year at 20.6%, reflecting strong operational performance, as well as the higher operating margins of FCI compared to the first quarter of last year. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance culture -- high performance action oriented culture in which each individual operating unit able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering for such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team continues to achieve industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $19 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company\u2019s stock buyback program. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was 22.8% for the first quarter of \u201817 compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5% in the first quarter of '16. The tax rate for the first quarter of '17 reflects the inclusion of the full cash tax benefit of option exercises and tax provisions as a result of the new accounting standards related to the stock competition which is effective for the Company January 1, 2017. I would also note that our guidance reflects an expected effective tax rate for the second quarter of approximately 26% and for the full year of approximately 25% to 26%. On a GAAP basis, the Company\u2019s first quarter '16 effective tax rate was 28.75%, which reflects the tax impact of the acquisition related costs incurred during the first quarter of that year. Net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of \u201817. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 42% for the first quarter of \u201917 to $0.71 from $0.50 in the first quarter of \u201916 and diluted EPS grew 20% compared to the first quarter of '16 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59. Orders for the quarter were $1.599 billion, an increase of 8% over the first quarter of '16, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash; cash flow from operations was $338 million in the quarter or approximately 105% of net income; and the Company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory was $962 million at the end of March; accounts receivable was approximately $1.3 billion and accounts payable was 682 million at the end of quarter; inventory days, day sales outstanding and payable days were 83, 76 and 59 days respectively, which are all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $238 million along with net borrowings of $225 million and stock option proceeds of $24 million were used primarily; to purchase approximately $249 million of the Company\u2019s stock; to fund dividend payments of $49 million; to fund net capital expenditures of $48 million; and to fund previously reported acquisition of approximately $47 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $104 million net of translation. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3.7 million shares at an average price of just under $68. These repurchases were made under Company\u2019s $1 billion three-year stock repurchased program that was improved in January. I would also note that the adoption of this new stock compensation standard have the effect of increasing our diluted weighted average shares by approximately 2 million shares. At March 31st, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Also, at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued $1.2 billion under its commercial paper program and the Company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2 billion. As previously announced, the Company had a successful senior note issuance in which the Company issued three and seven year notes aggregating $750 million on April 5th; and the Company intends to use the proceeds to repay all of its outstanding $375 million senior note, which is due this upcoming September, as well as for general corporate purposes. Prior to the $375 million note maturing, the Company used the net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its commercial paper program. After considering $750 million senior note, the aggregate cash and availability is approximately $8.8 billion. Total debt at March 31st was approximately $3.2 billion and net debt is approximately $2 billion. In the first quarter of \u201917, EBITDA was approximately $379 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I\u2019d like to offer my welcome to all of you on the call here today. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak to all here at the time of our first quarter earnings release. As is customary, I\u2019m going to first highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter; I\u2019ll then go into a little bit more on to the trends and progress across our served markets; and then finally I\u2019ll close with some comments on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year and of course we\u2019ll have time for questions at the end. With respect to the first quarter, we\u2019re very pleased that our results in the quarter were stronger than expected. We exceeded the high-end of our guidance in sales and earnings, and delivered what clearly a robust start for 2017. Craig mentioned our revenues increased by 8% in U. S. dollars and 5% organically, reaching that $1.560 billion level. And we\u2019re encouraged, in particular that bookings were strong, orders of $1.6 billion and that was a book-to-bill of 1.02:1. I think one thing we\u2019re really proud of is the increase in operating margins in the quarter, they increased 150 basis points from prior year to 20.1% and this is an excellent achievement by the entire organization. We talked about last year our quarter-over-quarter growth and we\u2019re just really pleased to see that the year-over-year improvement in the profitability of FCI was just reflected in this substantial margin improvement. And obviously, those earnings convert to cash and operating cash flow with a very strong $238 million. So in summary, I\u2019m just very proud of our team and once again the discipline and the agility of routine, it clearly reflected in the Company\u2019s great start here in 2017. Now, turning to our served market, to say that we remain very pleased with the breadths and balance of the Company\u2019s end markets; and given the ongoing dynamics is in the global electronic market, and I\u2019ll just say, the global economy at large, this balance across our market remains just a tremendous asset for the Company. Starting out with the military market, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased from prior year by a very significant 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. As we recovered from last year\u2019s DLA stop shipment and also realized growth across virtually every segment of the military market, our growth in the quarter was strongest as in space, vehicles, communications and ordinance related applications. But as I said, we really did see growth across the board and the military market. Sequentially, our sales were down as expected by about 5% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the military market to increase slightly from their current levels and for the full year 2017, we continued to expect growth in the low to mid single digits. I'll just say that we\u2019re very encouraged by our robust outlook in the military market and our strong performance in the quarter. Our team working in this important market has done just a truly phenomenal job, reaffirming our leadership position in the market while capitalizing on the many opportunities to leverage the Company's leading technology position on new military electronics. And we look forward to continuing to build on this position of strength as we move into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales are down slightly from prior year the volumes of helicopter and business jets, in particular, have not yet recovered. Sequentially, sales are flat with the fourth quarter, which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the quarter, as overall procurement volumes for commercial aircraft stabilized following recent ramp ups of new programs. Looking into the second quarter, we expect a small increase from these levels. And for the full year 2017, we now expect a single digit increase from prior year. Despite the slight moderation demand in this quarter, I'll just tell you that we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong overall position around the world in the commercial end market. Our team in this market is continuing to broaden the Company's range of product in support of the revolution of new electronics in next generation airplane. And we look forward to capitalizing on our standing technology for many years to come. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. As we benefited from several of our acquisitions completed last year, as well as from positive organic performance, in particular, in the instrumentation, heavy equipment and factory automation segment. Our sales in total grew by 4% organically from prior year. Sequentially, sales in the industrial market were slightly down from the fourth quarter due to typical seasonality. As we now look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels as we capitalize on our broad technological strength across the many various segments of the worldwide industrial market. And for the full year 2017, we continue to expect sales growth in the low to mid single digits. With respect to industrial market, we like many others, are certainly hopeful that the U.S. and other countries around the world begin to shift spending priorities toward necessary upgrades to infrastructure. At this point, however, it remains too early to predict whether this will indeed happen. Nevertheless, we\u2019re confident that Amphenol is well positioned to capitalize on any such initiatives should they materialize. And in fact, I\u2019ll just say that our teams who work in the global industrial market, continue to do an outstanding job of broadening our leading range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products to position us to capture opportunities for growth wherever they may arrive across the industrial market. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and we delivered another strong quarter in the automotive market. Sales increased by 10% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 11% organically with strong growth really in all regions. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased somewhat, just a slight bit from the fourth quarter, but which was a better than we had expected. We remain excited by our excellent and growing position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of interconnect products, including discrete connectors and complex interconnect assemblies, as well as our growing array of sensors together with our emerging offering of vehicle antennas, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars. Whether in traditional fuel powered, hybrid or electric vehicles, we see car makers around the world integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. And this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the automotive market to again grow from current levels. And for the full year 2017, we continue to expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, and as we expected coming into the quarter, our sales were down from the fourth quarter by a little bit over 20% sequentially due to the first quarter seasonality. Compared to the prior year, our sales were down by 18%, as significantly softer sales of products incorporated into tablets and smartphones were only partially offset by increases related to laptops and wearables. In the face of the significant down turn in demand, our team once again exercised their incredible agility in reacting to the volatility that\u2019s ever present in the mobile devices market. And meanwhile, we've not slowed our efforts in pursuit of a broad array of new design opportunities on a wide range of mobile devices. All well ensuring that regardless of these volume reductions, the Company still drives strong financial performance. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a strong double digit sequential increase in our sales as we benefit from new product ramp ups. For the full year, however, we still do not expect our sales to grow from 2016 levels. Regardless of our muted demand outlook for this year, we remain extremely confident that our experienced and agile team has positioned us to benefit and take advantage of any opportunities that may arise in this dynamic mobile devices market. The mobile networks market represents 9% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected, sales were down slightly from prior year as operators pause their investments in new wireless systems. Sequentially, sales declined by 7% again as we have expected from the fourth quarter. We have recently seen some wireless operator moderate their spending outlooks in the near term. And accordingly, while we expect sales in the second quarter to increase a bit from first quarter levels, we do now expect the low to mid single digit decline in sales in the mobile networks markets for the full year of 2017. Despite this somewhat more modest outlook, we remain confident in the Company\u2019s strong position across the mobile networks market. We continue to build out our leading portfolio of interconnect products and antennas, while expanding our partnerships with OEMs and service providers around the world. In addition, we are encouraged by several new discussions of new network investments that are planned in the coming years, and we look forward to taking advantage of those. With the acceleration of video and data traffic that\u2019s going through mobile networks, together with increasing demands by consumers for better coverage, Amphenol is well positioned to capitalize on any growth and spending that may occur in this important market. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. And we had another outstanding quarter in IT datacom. Our sales increased by greater than expected 25% in U.S. dollars, which included a very strong 21% organic growth. Sequentially, sales were down by a bit less than expected just 5% due to the normal seasonality that we see in the first quarter in this market. Just want to say that our team working in the IT datacom market has simply done an outstanding job, leveraging our next generation products to take advantage of growth opportunities across this very important market. In particular, we\u2019re very pleased that our industry leading high speed and power product portfolio is being adopted by OEMs as well as cloud service providers as they upgrade their networks to deal with the continued rapid expansion of data traffic. As we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to stay at these robust levels. And for the full year 2017, we now expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits for the IT datacom market. The broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased from prior year by 11%, driven by the benefits, in particular, from the All Systems broadband acquisition that we made at the end of last year. Sequentially, sales were a bit softer than we had expected and were flat to prior quarter. For the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels and for the full year, we continue to expect low double digit growth, supported by the All Systems Broadband acquisition, as well as by our organic efforts to expand with customers around the world. We\u2019re very pleased with our position in the broadband market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. We remain mindful that in the broadband market there is always the potential for further consolidation among operators around the world and sometimes that consolidation can result in pauses in capital investments. But nevertheless, as we look into 2017, we are optimistic for a positive spending environment this year and beyond. So just in summary, I want to say that we\u2019re extremely pleased with the Company\u2019s strong start to 2017. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well and expanding our market position while strengthening the Company's financial performance. Our superior performance is a direct reflection of the Company's distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across the diverse array of markets; our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and all underpinned with our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook. And based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and for the full year 2017 the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.580 billion to $1.620 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 respectively. This represents a sales and diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 2% to 5% and 8% to 11%. For the full year 2017, we expect sales in the range of $6.405 billion to $6.525 billion, and EPS in the range of $2.91 to $2.97. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 2% to 4% and 7% to 9% respectively over 2016 levels. On an organic basis, this represents full year sales growth of 1% to 3%. We\u2019re very encouraged by the Company\u2019s strong guidance and robust start to 2017. And I remain extremely confident in the ability of Amphenol\u2019s outstanding management team to build upon this robust start by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and at the same time, deliver strong financial performance in 2017 and beyond. And with that, operator, it\u2019d be our pleasure to take whatever questions there maybe. Operator : Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, I was wondering, given some of the changes that we\u2019re seeing in the political landscape. In light of that, would you say that you\u2019re perceiving that there might be larger opportunities here from a military, aerospace and market demand trend? And secondarily on the industrial side, we\u2019re hearing of a level of restock that is occurring within the channel. I was wondering if you could comment, if you\u2019ve seen any trends that would support or renegade that view. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Look, I am not going to be the one to guess, which way political winds are blowing. I would be surprised if we\u2019re the number one story of today, though. Currently, there is lots of other announcements to come out. With respect to military aerospace, I have been talking as you know very well Wamsi for quite some time about a trend that we have been seeing in the military market; and I think in the geopolitical environment, overall, which is that we believe that there is a transition from a more technical military stance to a more strategic military stance. Whereby the spending priorities of the U.S., which have been much more towards dealing with unseen enemies and unseen priorities which is very technical responsive thing, I have seen to migrate more and more towards a more strategic imperative. And as we said all along, as this more strategic imperative takes over in the military market, whether that\u2019d be with new enemies or resurgent enemies that our country or our allies may have that that ultimately, we believe, leads to more investments and technology. And at the end of the day, the technological developments in the military are some of the things that can truly have an impact on the strategic priorities. And we just remain very, very well positioned for that. We are -- we continue to be the leader in military interconnect product. We continue to be a true partner for our customers as they seek to develop new enabling technologies. And I think the results that we saw this quarter and frankly even last year, despite having had the DLA issue a year ago, we remain having last year\u2019s strong organic growth in the military market and we expect the same this year. What the long-term opportunity will be, that\u2019s very hard for me to predict here now. But what I can tell you is, regardless of what it will be, Amphenol will be there is support of the technological requirements of militaries around the world. As it relates to industrial market and whether there is a restocking that is occurring there, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we have necessarily seen tangible evidence of restocking per se. I think we\u2019re pleased with the performance in our distribution channel. But as you know, distribution represents for us somewhat less than 15% of our overall sales. So we may not be necessarily the best bellwether to determine whether or not there is in fact such a restocking. The industrial market for us performed very well in the quarter. And I think I called out in my remarks that some of those areas have strength that we saw, in particular, areas like factory automation, have equipment, instrumentation; we saw also strength in places like medical, even in the area like the marine market. And one thing I would point out in industrial, even if we had for a couple of years a down turn in oil and gas, which has put significant pressure on overall industrial sales; we were very pleased this quarter for the first quarter in many to see a sequential increase in our oil and gas sales. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a restocking at a distribution level, but at least it\u2019s a sign that may be one can smell a bottom there. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Mark Delaney. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : First question is on mobile devices market, Adam you talked about some about some product launches helping sales to increase double digit sequentially in the June quarter. Can you comment on what sorts of applications does that tablets or something else that is driving the pick-up in the June quarter in mobile devices? And then as you think about the full year, can you just help characterize what your expectations are for Amphenol to be able to participate in flagship product launches for smartphones later this year? And if that does come to fruition, what would that mean relative to your full year guidance in mobile devices? Adam Norwitt : I'm not going to comment in specific programs or product launches. I\u2019ll tell you that we work in a broad array of different products in the mobile devices market. And as we look into the second quarter, I think we see also a broad array of different products which -- where we start to see the launch cycles happening. In terms of flagship products, again I'm not going to comment specifically on that, but we have good position across customers in the mobile devices market. At the same time, we've embedded into the guidance that we see and we continue to see this year to be a flat year in mobile devices. All what we know about the product launches that we\u2019re involved in at this stage, it\u2019s a very volatile market. I just would reemphasize that that predicting ultimately what products gets released at what times and what consume and which product sale to which consumer at which volume. This remains a task that is far beyond our expertise. And what we continue to do with that business in the way that we continue to manage that business is to be ready regardless. And the readiness that our team exhibit is both on the downside and the up side, and I think we've seen that this quarter the ability to flex the organization to not sacrifice the work that we're doing with customers to design in our products, regardless of the fact that we saw significant sequential and a year-over-year reduction in our sales. And all along the way, clearly, to preserve operating performance, else we wouldn\u2019t be having the overall margins that we have in the Company. And similarly, should there be an opportunity for upside, if it comes in a typically very unpredictable fashion, I can tell you that our team will be ready to capitalize on that to the full extent at the level of the opportunity. Mark Delaney : And then for a follow up question, seems like a bit on the capital allocation of the Company -- the Company has operated in a 0.5 to 1.5 turns of net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio recently, you talked about the senior note financing and doing some more on the buybacks. Can you just talk about your leverage tolerance? And as you think about potential M&A, would you be willing to increase the leverage ratios versus where the Company has operated at in last several years? Craig Lampo : I think with regards the Company's capital deployment this really hasn\u2019t changed over the years. And we continue to have a consistent and flexible and balanced approach to this where we have about long term about half of our capital will be deployed to share -- return it to shareholders regarding the dividends in our share repurchase program that we announced earlier this year as a continuation of that. We did repurchased 3.7 million shares in the quarter. Certainly, that varies from quarter-to-quarter depending on cash needs and what not. But we feel certainly very good about that and very good about that deployment. In terms of our leverage ratio, I would tell that we\u2019re very happy. We have been in that 0.5 to 1.5, roughly 1, 1.3; I think we ended the quarter in this period. The Company continues to generate a significant amount of cash. And I think what I would tell is that if I were to look upon what we would be willing to go to from a M&A seem to come about that we want to do, I would say maybe 2 to 2.5 range would be something we would be comfortable with; with certainly the thought in mind that we have a very prudent approach to that and we certainly value our investment grade ratings, so we wouldn\u2019t do anything to be end of that. But I think 2.5 would be something that I would be -- we would be comfortable with. So I think that we\u2019re very comfortable with the cap that Company continues to generate a significant amount of cash flow. And certainly, we continue to do that in the first quarter of this year. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Couple of questions from me as well, I guess Adam, maybe just out, but the IT datacom market. I think the second quarter in a row you guys have had 20% plus organic growth here, I don\u2019t think IT spends were anywhere close to that. So can you just talk about what is driving the strength for you guys? And importantly, could you sustain this growth potentially throughout 2017 but the compares really don\u2019t get difficult than the December quarter, I think? Adam Norwitt : We\u2019re very pleased with the performance over the course of the last two quarters in the IT datacom market. I mean in fact if you look at what we did last year, we grew 11% organically for the year. You\u2019re correct we grew I think it was close to 29% organically in the fourth quarter, and we just grew 21% organically in this quarter. Are we going to keep growing at that rate, well I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve necessarily guided to that level. I think I mentioned that we expect for the IT datacom market to grow this year in the mid to high single digits, which is actually a little bit higher than we had expected coming into the year. We remained very attentive and ready to capitalize on whatever opportunities will come our way. Ultimately, our outperformance has come really from two aspects. One is just a breadth of high technology leading edge products and that was enhanced so much through the FCI acquisition; a breadth of products that become really a one stop shop for customers when they need their equipment to perform better. And I think that that technology that we offer in the IT datacom market is really second to none; when you think about the range of products in high speed, the power products and the whole array of things that are used in IT datacom, also they go into servers and store system to networking appliances and data centers and all the equipment associated with ultimately powering the internet, is where our products are ending up. So I think that\u2019s very important aspect. And I think the second has been just the ability of our team in working the IT datacom market to quickly pivot to where the opportunities are. And this is not a new concept that I have spoken about it many times. So when we see these results, I think that really is a great testament to our people following the opportunity. And not just resting on your one field going to the same customer that you\u2019ve been going for decades and decades, but rather quickly steering and pivoting toward those customers where the real opportunity is. And that is not an easy task. It is something that we demand of our people and that our people demand of themselves. But it's certainly not easy going to change what you have been doing and to say; I am going to start knocking on the door of someone new; I am going to understand the whole new market; I am going to understand the whole new way of doing business with those customers, which is entirely different from maybe what you are doing in the past. And I just give a lot of credit to our for the flexibility and agility. Words that I used frequently, proud of Amphenol, Amphenolean, really reacting to where that opportunity is. And then taking advantage of that very first thing I mentioned, which is the breath of the technologies. And ultimately, if you can get the right product, the people who want to get it at the right time, it's not a bad way to win in business. Amit Daryanani : And then Craig, if I could just follow up on some of the changes in stock auction resulted in the numbers and will run a little bit. Is it fair to think at least on the tax line, the tax rate still early 26.5 but these discreet things are lowered by about 100 basis points for the year. And then the share count creep up, was that just a one-off thing in the March quarter true up thing? Or does that happen throughout the year as well? Craig Lampo : So with regard to the tax rate I would tell you that there is obviously a lot of things that impact tax rate over the course of time. And as Adam referenced before, we\u2019re sitting here in a day that we were I think some tax reform things may be coming out and certainly who knows what's going to happen with the tax rate for all companies going forward. But I would tell you that the primary impact certainly in this quarter and in our outlook for the full year is the impact that its adoption in terms of putting into our guidance some impact of that. So in regards to the share count, I would tell you that the increase of $2 million shares that I referenced is something that's kind of a permanent increase that happened in the quarter. It really relates to how the amount of shares that you could buy back as it relates to the options exercised in this, all the treasury stock methods effect as calculated and what it does essentially, is increased the share count as relate to that. So for us is how the impact of increasing it by 2 million shares, which you can effectively model and for -- going forward from a comparability perspective. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : You guys are seeing very high operating margins above the 20% range. And typically 20%, 8.5 is really the high point for you. But if I look at the full year guidance it suggests that operating margins will be at least 20.5%, which suggest an improvement in operating margins in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Can you give us a little bit of detail that what\u2019s driving that and do you still see the same contribution margin for your business going forward? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I think we\u2019re actually very proud certainly of our operating performance in the first quarter at 20.1%, 40 basis points reduction on the 6% decrease in sales, is something that we\u2019re certainly proud of. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s out of the normal range of our conversion on down decline in sales, we think further around 27% on a decline. We\u2019ve talked about over the long-term that 25% conversion margin is our targeted conversion margin from an organic perspective. And I think if you look sequentially in our guidance what you find it that we\u2019re guiding to a little bit higher than that, but not so dramatically higher than that. But I will tell you that there is any change in terms of our long-term strategy that 25% conversion margin, it does vary from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. But I think that is still something that we target long-term. And more recently, we\u2019ve done a good job I think of executing operationally to do just a little bit better than that; so certainly, we\u2019re very proud of that. And I would say that there would be higher ROF in the second half just due to those increased sales levels that would essentially convert as that higher conversion margin. Sherri Scribner : And then can you maybe give a little detail on what you\u2019re seeing from a currency perspective. GE saw a little bit of benefit versus the prior expectations from FX this morning when they reported. We\u2019ve heard mix messages on FX from other companies. Maybe you can give us some detail on how much FX impacted your changing guidance? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : So the first \u2013 so when we gave guidance in January, I think the biggest two currencies that changed, euro change a bit. But not dramatically since we gave guidance in January, and actually the renminbi came down a bit. So I would tell you that from a full year perspective versus our prior guidance, there really wasn\u2019t so much of a benefit. There was a slight benefit but we\u2019re talking negligible amount at this. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily -- we didn\u2019t call out and I wouldn\u2019t call out as anything of significance for the year. I\u2019m not sure what other people guided to in terms of what rates they were using. But for us that\u2019s what I would talk about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question, this comes from line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : So Adam just wanted to get a little bit more color on the automotive market. You gave fairly robust guidance for the year in mid to high-single-digits. That does imply though a bit of a deceleration in the back half, but still strong growth and looks like above some of your competitors. And of course we\u2019re running into tough comps in the back half with China. But you did talked about growth drivers across not just your interconnect products but sensors and antennas. So what\u2019s your general outlook not just for the market but in terms of your content growth opportunity? Adam Norwitt : Look, the other market has brought a really great driver over a number of years and that\u2019s no different here in the first quarter. We\u2019re just really pleased to see this double-digit organic growth, the continuation of the trend that we\u2019ve seen for number of years. I think your math is right that if we\u2019re going 11% organically and then I guide to mid to high single digit that would arithmetically imply that there is some slightly lower growth in the second half. And as usual, we're guiding really to what we see today. We don\u2019t -- may be a little bit differently than other companies; we don\u2019t necessarily look at overall vehicle unit volumes and extrapolate from that in our own business. We think about the opportunities that we're pursuing with our customers and what our customers are telling us about those opportunities. And often times that really is, not tide to vehicle volumes, but more by the implantation of new systems and cars. And I can just tell you that as Craig and I travel around the world and we visit with our operations, working in automotive markets as I visit customers who are participating in that market. Just the unbelievable array of new functionalities that are being adopted into cars and that\u2019s a lot of people talk about electric cars or hybrid cars, diesel, there is always parsing of different categories of cars. But I think about it a little bit differently, just all cars are getting more electronics no matter what. And that\u2019s just seeming one way ratchet upwards. And so the job of our teams that\u2019s working in the automotive market is to make sure that they can harness our technological capabilities, which have broaden very significantly over the recent really half decade. And ensure that we are participating and gaining more than our fair share of those new electronic systems that are being put into cars. That\u2019s easy for me to say, there is a lot of hard work behind that from our people really in the field, designing the products and executing on those new systems. But there is just no doubt about it that the number of systems being put into cars is expanding regardless of the category of the car and regardless of the overall unit volumes in the car. I think we did talk last year at the end of the year about some strength that we had seen in particular at year end in Asia and I think we weren\u2019t the only company to talk about that. We\u2019re very pleased actually this quarter that our growth was quite balanced. I think we saw little bit stronger performance in Europe, but I would say just a little bit strong in the other two regions we\u2019re also growing in a very robust fashion. And I think as we look out over the course of the year, we would expect to see may be that same balance and that does compare to end of last year where it was little more levered towards Asia growth towards the end of the year. And again is that because of subsidies or because of whatever, I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019re close enough to the various government policies to know whether those subsidies are going to continue or not continue. But at the end of day, it is about us gaining more position on a broader array of electronic systems that are being implemented on a broader array of cars. It is just amazing, I mean I went car shopping not so long ago and I feel like I need to take my teenage son with me to car shop, because he knows how to work the computers now better than I do. I guess it\u2019s a sign of me getting old. So that is what it is but these cars are just unbelievable data centers on wheels now where that didn\u2019t used to be the case. And I think that\u2019s a great opportunity for Amphenol and it\u2019s a great opportunity for our industry and one that we fully expect to take full advantage of, going forward. Operator : Thank you very much. For our next question, this comes from the line of James Suva of Citi. Your line is open. James Suva : A clarification question and then a more detailed follow up, the clarification question, when you mentioned the stock number -- diluted outstanding share number that went up, you mentioned that that was a permanent step up. What you meant and going forward, did you mean that every single quarter we should expect that step up or you're just saying from this level continuing on? I wasn\u2019t sure if you meant it continues to keep stepping up every quarter. And then my follow up question was more about your year, I think you said organic growth rate of 1% to 3%. And I think this quarter organically was about 5%, help me bridge the difference between the big deceleration if I got my math wrong? Adam Norwitt : Jim thanks for the question. And to clarify, it is a one-time step up that stays consistent, going forward. And with respect to the organic growth question Jim, I think we talked a lot about this at our last quarter's call that we see what we see at the beginning of the year, we work in a very volatile -- we are working in a market that has its level of volatility to it in particular in certain of our markets. And we believe that given the rate of markets that we\u2019re in that this is a very prudent but also a very strong guidance. Now, again, doing the same arithmetic that you\u2019re doing if we grow 5% organically in the first quarter, that would imply that there must be another that\u2019s below that 1% to 3% level; and I think again, the arithmetic is correct there, but no doubt about it. It doesn\u2019t change our view of the year that we continue to see this as a year where we can grow organically at 1% to 3%. But where our team will remain singularly fixated on capitalizing on any opportunities that there may be to do better than that and I think we did better than that here in the first quarter and we\u2019re very pleased that we started the year strong, we came into the quarter with an expectation not to get to that 5% organic growth and we did it and we\u2019re going to keep fighting our way to do that as much as we can. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Shawn Harrison : Two part are on mobile if I may, one on devices one infrastructure business; first on infrastructure. Adam, maybe if you could describe where may be which region you\u2019ve seen the pull back in activity? And then second on the device business. Are you walking away from any content opportunities, are you pulling out of any devices beyond just what you\u2019ve seen in some of the tablet, smartphone weakness out there? Adam Norwitt : I think with your first question on infrastructure, I think in the quarter, in the first quarter, Europe performed a bit better than Asia and North America. And I think that we would expect in our guidance for that to be the case, and I think we\u2019ve seen a little bit probably more North America in terms of some of the expectations pulling back. Again, these are not huge numbers. As I said, I think, we came into last quarter, thinking it's going to be flat now we think it's may be low single digit, low to mid single digit down. So that\u2019s not an enormous change in our outlook, but it' a little change and we want to share that with everybody. We\u2019re going to stay very mindful. It's a market where the predictions are not as easy to make in wireless infrastructure because the capital spending sometimes happens without necessarily so much warning to supplier and to everybody. And so we\u2019re just going to continue doing what we\u2019ve always done in that market. And that to make sure that we\u2019re positioning ourselves with our broad range of interconnect and antenna products, across OEMs and operators, across every reason where we can participate. And in our experience the better job we do of doing that the more able we are to capitalize on the spending when it does come. And I think we have a very strong position here. We had a great year last year in mobile networks, a year where we didn\u2019t necessarily anticipated coming in and where ultimately we grew 9% organically and 24% last year with the impact of the acquisitions, in particular FCI. And so as we approach that market right now, we\u2019re going to stay very mindful of any opportunities that will come our way. And we\u2019ve got a great set of people and a great set of products to pursue in that area. As it relates to mobile devices, we don\u2019t adopt a strategy really in any of our business from quote on quote walking away from business, that\u2019s not been our approach. But as you know, our consistent approach in mobile devices is to participate where we have value for our customers. And so that comes just naturally where when customers decide that there is not a value embedded in the product that you sell then we may not participate because we won't be able to make the returns that we would otherwise make from the new round of things. So we\u2019re never walking away from existing platforms; we\u2019re never discontinuing products or discontinuing customer relationships; again, that\u2019s just not the way that we approach this high speed and high volatility market that there is. As we think about the guidance that we have here, I think I mentioned we saw in the first quarter in particular weaker performance in tablets that\u2019s not a new phenomenon, it's something that we\u2019ve been talking about for the better part of the last three four quarters. And we would expect that to continue; there just seems to be material and systematic consumer shift away from tablet and towards other devices, either handsets or smaller laptops. And the prospects of tablets to me at least it seem to as terrific as they once were. And for us it is what is; we\u2019re going to continue to design in our products; we\u2019re going to continue to work with customers across every aspect of that. And I think the success that we\u2019ve had in an area like wearables where we actually did grow in wearables quite significantly on a year-over-year basis, which was certainly nowhere near enough to offset the downturn in tablets and some that we saw in handsets. But it's just a great recognition of the fact that our team is quickly tacking towards where there is opportunity and where there is value that can be embedded in those products. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to approach the market; we\u2019re not walking away from anything; we\u2019re not changing our strategy; we\u2019ve a very consistent approach and it's an approach that served us very well through second thin and we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been flat; we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been up and we\u2019ve had years where we\u2019ve been down. And I think that\u2019s second nature to the type of market that you\u2019re dealing with in mobile devices. And so we\u2019re still very committed to market; we\u2019re very committed to investing in the products in the market and with the customers in that market; and we\u2019ll be a partner for our customers in everywhere where our technology can make a difference in their products. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open. William Stein : I wanted to address one of the earlier comments about somewhat higher than typical conversion margins in the back half of the year based on the guidance. And I wonder if that\u2019s being helped by mix or specifically by your sensor business or is this something else going on and is this drop through higher level of incremental margins permanent change in the model? Adam Norwitt : I would tell you that there is nothing specific that we recall out, it certainly is the market mix; we\u2019re converting into the second half on higher volumes, not so much differently than we did on an organic sales last year; and I think we\u2019ve just been operating executing well from an operational perspective over the last year or so; may be better in certain areas. But I would tell you that there is a whole bunch of different factors that go into be able to convert at these levels and for talking 25% versus 30%; we\u2019re not talking significant changes in his conversion. So I would tell you that longer term, as I mentioned to Sherri, I wouldn\u2019t think about this as a permanent chain that we\u2019re going to continue to convert at these really high -- 30% or so margins going forward on higher sales. But certainly, there is some quarters where we will convert at these high levels. And I\u2019m sure depending on the environment that we\u2019re in, whether or not commodity environments have an impact or different pricing environments have an impact or what not, there could be certain periods where we convert lower than that 25%. But I think the team has done a great job of balancing the factors in the environment that they\u2019re in at the moment and has been able to convert at a little bit higher level than really our long-term goal and certainly we\u2019re very proud of that accomplishment. William Stein : One follow-up if I can, it seems like this hasn\u2019t been the theme through earnings. But intra-quarter, we were getting signals from distribution that it sounded like there were some shortages and stretching lead times, and there is at least one well known semiconductor company that issues letters periodically and needed this quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you saw that in any of your end markets or businesses this quarter accelerating demand that caused shortages. Or for that matter, in complementary products like passes that might have limited your customers\u2019 interest to take product, because of availability of the complementary products? Adam Norwitt : Well, I mean we\u2019ve heard and probably read the same thing that you have read. I can tell you that we haven\u2019t seeing shortages in our industry per se. And I haven\u2019t seen any at least tangible indication of shortages driving our customers to not procure as much of our product as they otherwise would have intended. But we have certainly heard about some stretching lead times, I think where I\u2019ve heard it most acutely, has been in areas like memory and NAND and DRAMs and things like that. And we\u2019re of course mindful of that. I know we have a lot of customers and I can sometimes tell by where our procurement trends are spending their time as to what is running short at a given time. And so it\u2019s on the basis of where I\u2019ve seen some people spending their time, I guess that would indicate that some of those rumors or things like memory shortages and otherwise may in fact be true. But I have yet to see again in instance where these shortages are doing anything in terms of limiting demand by our customers. Certainly, have heard a lot about pricing and there is a lot of discussion in the industry around pricing of certain semiconductors and the frustration that many of the OEMs are having around those price -- the price increases that they\u2019re seeing. But this has not translated, as far as we can see, into any changes in the demand for our products in terms of their complementary position on various systems of our customers. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Just real quickly, Adam, you mentioned antennas again this time with industrial. I was just curious, if you could talk about what kind of applications you\u2019re now expanding into with the industrial antennas? And then I had a quick follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Look, we\u2019re really proud of our antenna business overall. We started out as antenna manufacture in mobile devices and phones, and its early to say, and we\u2019re coming flow, I guess nearly being two decades as an antenna suppliers. So it\u2019s hard to call it a new business for us anymore. But over the years, our teams who work in antennas whether that was in the device side or on the infrastructure side where we\u2019ve also been present for nearly a decade and half. Our team has done the classic Amphenol saying and that is looked to diversify the business. From where you start out you take that technology and you try to diversify it. And I think industrial automotive and other areas have been just a real great opportunity to start to build some businesses around antennas. So in industrial, we're working in areas like police and safety; we're working in ship borne applications; we're very active in things like what's called I guess broadly the industrial Internet of Things; and what is a little bit of well worn clich\u00e9. But ultimately it talks about the increasing the connectivity or the connected capabilities of industrial equipments overall. And in order to increase that connected capability one typically has to have an antenna, one typically has to have some interconnect products, and one typically has to have some sensors. And I think our present as a designer and a manufacturer and a provider of all three of those very complimentary products, which we all consider ultimately interconnect, is really putting us in a very strong position for that whole IoT or IIoT revolution that is there. So we're going to continue to invest heavily in our antenna business. So I mentioned as well that we\u2019re starting to see some better progress in automotive antenna as automotive antennas get more complicated and as they require more knowledge to support things like autonomous driving and 5G technology. These are all areas where we see a greater opportunity for that entire radio frequency interconnect system that includes connectors, cable, assembly cable, antennas and all that goes in amidst that whole system. And it\u2019s something we're going to continue to drive as a real leader in this industry. Steven Fox : And then just really quickly, capital spending for this year, I was curious if you can give us a range and whether your comfort level with your current footprint whether you might be considering expanding anywhere, in particular. Thanks. Craig Lampo : From a capital spending prospective, it really hasn\u2019t changed. I think our range is 2% to 4% and we've done within that range over the longer term. I think last year may around 3% plus or minus a couple 10 basis points or so. So I think the 2% to 4% range is the way I would think about our capital spending, which again is consistent with historic spending. Adam Norwitt : And relative to our footprint, Steve, I would just say we're always looking at expanding or changing or moving or doing something with our footprint. You know very well as you follow the Company for so many years that we take an approach in our manufacturing footprint of really preserving as much as we can flexibility in that footprint; by trying as best as we can to have leases of the building; by not having huge centralized facilities; and thereby having the ability to be able to move factories when we need to move then for whatever reason possible. And over the years, we've moved production for lots of reasons; to reduce cost; to accommodate customer needs; to deal with changes in regulations; to deal with changes in the cost of freight; to deal with currency, you name it. There is a whole range of things that can come out to you as a manufacturing company and the better that we can preserve the manufacturing flexibility within Amphenol, the more rapidly we can adapt and actually take advantage of changes when they come our way. And so are we looking to expand our footprint, I think in the last quarter we have certainly opened a few new facilities, and we\u2019ve probably moved one or two at the same time. We have a lot of facilities around the world that you can see it in our 10-K I think we\u2019re somewhere around north of 200 facilities worldwide. And there is always some movement going somewhere in preparation or anticipation or in reaction to some change that\u2019s coming in our marketplace. Operator : Thank you. For our next question, this comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Adam, now that you\u2019re more than a year into the FCI acquisition. Can you talk about just maybe any unexpected cause of surprises or how that business is layered in versus initial expectations, and whether it\u2019d be synergies on the OpEx front, revenue, et cetera? Adam Norwitt : I think we\u2019ve just been pleasantly, surprised is maybe the wrong word, but let's just say we\u2019ve been very satisfied and very pleased with the performance of FCI on a very, very broad basis. And I could keep you all in the phone here for a quite a well talking about the various aspects of why that is. But just starting from the top to financial performance has been outstanding. We talked at the end of last year at our last earnings call how ultimately we were able to realize an accretion of $0.19 a share and we came into the year thinking it was going to be $0.12. So that alone, from a financial performance, was outstanding. They increased the margins, and I say they meaning the FCI team, who really has done the work here. They increased the margins of the business quite significantly, bringing them really into the level of where Amphenol operations like to perform. We saw just a great embrace of the Amphenol culture by the people and just so proud to have all the people from FCI who just on day one they flipped the switch and they said we want to be part of this Amphenol. And that has worked out extremely well for us and for them in addition. I think the response of customers and ultimately the presence that we\u2019ve gained with customers and has probably surpassed my early expectations. You frequently come into an acquisition like this with some dreams and aspirations in terms of well we can expand our presence with customers and this or that area, and that will take some time and it usually doesn\u2019t happen overnight. I think here our commitment to the markets where FCI participates; markets like the IT datacom markets; markets like the embedded computing market in industrial; markets like the mobile networks market. Us making that very significant commitment to being a leader, a broad leader, for customers in those markets has been received very well and rewarded very well. And we had the question earlier with respect to the organic growth in the IT datacom market that I\u2019m asked earlier in the call and I would tell that I think a part of our organic strength has in fact been related to the presence of FCI and the broad reception that we\u2019ve gotten from customers in there. And I think the last thing I would point to is as the distribution channel. We talked about that early on when we made the acquisition of FCI and the response from our distributors has just been outstanding. And I think that we now sit in a stronger position viz-a-viz our distributors and we did prior to acquiring FCI. And I gave the FCI team again a lot of credit for knowing how to work with distributors, maybe even a little bit of a different way than we had in the past and that has really helped our Company overall. So I added all up and we\u2019re just very pleased with the acquisition, and I don\u2019t even refer to it any longer as an acquisition as far as I am concerned, FCI it feels like they\u2019ve been part of our Company for decades. Operator : Thank you. For our question, this comes from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Tristan Margot : This is Tristan in for Joe, thanks for squeezing me in here. Adam, I think you mentioned the opportunity for new mobile networks going forward in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you exposed to the upcoming first responded network that was awarded a few weeks ago. And if that\u2019s the case then could you try to frame the opportunity for us in terms of magnitude and timing? Adam Norwitt : I think we have exposure to a lot of different networks, and I think that would include the one that you mentioned here, which I think is referred to as FirstNet and in the marketplace. What the magnitude of that is going to be, what the magnitude of that for us is going to be, I think it's too early to tell. But we\u2019re always encouraged whenever we see a new overlay network thing that has traditionally been a very good thing for us. I think our team really jumps on those opportunities well in advance even if their announcement to make sure that we\u2019re present with customers really around the world who are doing these things with their networks. And with something like FirstNet again I think it's still a little early to tell what that ultimately was going to work out to be. But you can imagine whenever you have a new overlay networks like that, there is not just a network thing built but there is devices, there is sub-systems, there is a whole eco system that gets built around something like that. And I think ultimately when you have new electronic ecosystems being built out, that\u2019s a good thing for our Company. Tristan Margot : And then you could just add quick one on datacom and congrats on your strong result there. I was wondering if you could breakdown your expectation by region and if you are seeing any inventory build in any of the regions? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : I think on region, I don\u2019t think there is anything really interesting to report on the regional aspects over datacom business. It's very hard to say because a lot of datacom equipment is all built in Asia. And so we don\u2019t ultimately know where that equipment ends up. And so a regional review of this is actually not the most interesting or germane to talk about in the business. In terms of inventory and IT datacom, we haven\u2019t seen any significant signs of inventory builds, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen across all of our markets any abnormalities, let me say with inventory across datacom or really any of our markets. Operator : Thank you. For our last question, this comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel. Your line is open. Mr. White, your line is open for your question. Adam Norwitt : Well, it appears that maybe Brian is not with us here. I think that is the last question and we very much appreciate everybody's time here and your attention in Amphenol. And we look forward to speaking with you all here in another 90 days or so. Thanks very much and best wishes to you all for a successful spring. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference. Have a nice day.",

LLC Operator : Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo and Mr. Adam Norwitt. You may begin. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We'd like to welcome you to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Our second quarter 2017 results were released this morning, I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends, then we'll take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with record sales GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.667 billion, $0.80 and $0.81 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by $47 million, GAAP EPS by $0.08 and adjusted EPS by $0.09. Sales were up 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the second quarter increased a strong 6%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and organically. Bringing down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 16% from the second quarter of last year, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions as well as organic growth. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 7% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP operating income and adjusted operating income were $336 million and $340 million respectively for the second quarter. GAAP operating margin was 20.2% in the quarter and GAAP operating income includes approximately $4 million or $0.01 per share of acquisition-related transaction cost. Adjusted operating margin was 20.4% in the quarter, which is up a strong 100 basis points compared to 19.4% on a GAAP and adjusted basis in 2016 and was up 30 basis points from the first quarter of this year. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 14.9%, which is unchanged compared to the second quarter of last year. In the Interconnect segment, margins increased to 22.3% in the second quarter, compared to last year at 21.2%, reflecting the progress made at FCI as well as strong overall operational performance. This excellent performance is the direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $23 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the quarter as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's GAAP and adjusted effective tax rates were approximately 20% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 26% and an effective tax of 26.5% in second quarter of last year. As a result of the 2017 adoption of the new stock-based compensation standard that we discussed last quarter, option exercise activity had the effect of lowering the company's second quarter tax provision by approximately $21 million and increasing the diluted EPS by approximately $0.07. I would also note that our guidance reflects an expected effective tax rate for the third quarter of approximately 25% and for the full year of approximately 23% to 24%. Net income is a strong 15% of sales in the quarter. GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS with $0.80 and $0.81 respectively in the quarter compared to $0.65 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 25% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. This strong growth was supported by strong operating performance as demonstrated by the company's adjusted operating margin of 20.4% along with the lower effective tax rate just mentioned. Orders for the quarter were $1.712 billion, an 8% increase over the second quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash and cash flow from operations with $280 million in the quarter or approximately 111% of net income. The company continues to target and achieve cash flow from operations in excess of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion and $770 million respectively at the end of the quarter. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84 days, 74 days and 61 days respectively, excluding the impact of acquisitions recently closed, which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $280 million, along with the $750 million of bond proceeds from the new senior notes previously mentioned, and stock option proceeds of $49 million were used primarily to fund net payments under the commercial paper program of $589 million. To fund acquisitions and purchases of minority interest of $168 million, to purchase approximately $151 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $51 million and to fund dividend payments of $49 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $80 million net of translation. Note that this does not include the amount paid for Telect here in July. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares at an average price of approximately $75. These repurchases were completed under the company's $1 billion, two year stock repurchase program that was approved in January. To date, the company has repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares or $400 million under the plan. In addition, as mentioned in the earnings release, the company's board of directors has approved a 19% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.16 to $0.19 per share, bringing the dividend yield back to approximately 1%. This increase is effective for payments beginning in October. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.4 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Also at the end of the quarter, the company has issued $655 million under its commercial paper program, and the company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.7 billion. Total debt at June 30 was approximately $3.4 billion and net debt is approximately $2 billion. In the second quarter of 2017, EBITDA was approximately $403 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome all of you to our quarterly call here with respect to our second quarter earnings. I will spend a few moments just to highlight some of the achievements in the second quarter that Craig just detailed. I'll then discuss the trends and our progress across our various served markets and then spend a few moments at the end to comment on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year of 2017. And of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. In the second quarter, we delivered results above the high end of guidance, as we establish new records in orders, sales, and earnings per share, all while continuing to expand our industry-leading operating margins. As Craig mentioned, revenues increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, reaching that new record of $1.670 billion. We're very pleased that our order bookings were strong with a book-to-bill of 1.03:1, reaching $1.700 billion in orders. And in particular, I think our whole team is proud that our margins continue to increase by a strong 100 basis points over prior year to 20.4% and that's just a really excellent achievement by the whole organization. EPS reached a new record of $0.81, increasing 25% from prior year, and we generated cash as well with cash flow reaching a very robust $280 million. The last thing I'll say is that I'm very pleased that just yesterday our board of directors approved a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.19 per quarter, yet another sign and confirmation of the strength of Amphenol's financial condition. So I'll just say that I'm very proud of our team. The Amphenol organization's discipline and agility is clearly reflected in the company's excellent second quarter results. On the second quarter, our small headquarters acquisition team was extremely busy throughout the last quarter and in particular during the last week or two of the quarter and beginning of this quarter. We closed on three important and exciting acquisitions that actually involved five distinct businesses, collectively with revenues, annual revenues of approximately $165 million. First in late June, we acquired three sensor businesses from the UK-based defense company Meggitt PLC. These three outstanding and entrepreneurial operations are based in Spain, as well as Maryland and Indiana, focused on vibration, position and ultrasonic sensing solutions that are used in the industrial, automotive and military markets. And collectively those three organizations have sales totaling approximately $75 million. These companies, which operate as PIHER, Wilcoxon and Piezo Technologies or Piezotech, represent an excellent complement to our expanding offering of sensor technologies. Second, and also in late June, we acquired Intelligente Sensorsysteme or i2S, a Dresden, Germany-based manufacturer of pressure, temperature and mass airflow sensors for the automotive and industrial markets, with annual sales of approximately $45 million. i2S is an extremely high technology sensor supplier with a particular strength in harsh environment pressure sensors that are used in a variety of applications. With these new sensor acquisitions, I can just say that we're very pleased that we've now made another great step forward in expanding and diversifying our sensor offering, and that's the road that we've been on for now, the better part of 3.5 years. And we continue to look forward to finding both organic and inorganic ways to expand the company's position in the sensor market. Finally, in early July, just a few weeks ago, we completed the acquisition of Telect Incorporated. Telect is a Washington state-based manufacturer of power, fiber, and copper interconnect systems for data centers with annual sales of approximately $45 million. In addition to its Washington State facility, Telect also operates a manufacturing operation in Mexico. We're really pleased Telect, which is a family company that was founded 35 years ago \u2013 it has a strong track record of supplying high technology, value-add products with unique service solution for enterprise and service provider data centers. And the addition of this great business bolsters our already very strong offering of products that support expanding data center applications. Just want to say that once again I'm extremely proud of our acquisition team as they've brought on these excellent new additions to the Amphenol family, which gives us just great confidence that our acquisition program will continue to create significant value for the company going into the future. Now, with respect to our trends and progress across our served markets, we remain just very pleased with the breadth and balance of the company's end markets. We believe that that balance in particular is a great asset for Amphenol, especially given the ongoing dynamics within the global electronics market. Turning first to the military market; the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased from prior year by a greater-than-expected 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, as we recovered from last year's DLA-stopped shipment and again realized growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our growth in the quarter was strongest in space, ordnance-related, naval, military vehicle and communications applications, but it was truly a very broad based growth in the military market. And I would say, it was broad based also geographically. We are very pleased to see great growth in Europe as well as in North America and other geographies. Sequentially, our sales in the military market were up by 4%, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter. And looking into the third quarter, we expect sales in the military market to be slightly lower on the traditional summer seasonality. Nonetheless, for the full-year 2017, we now expect sales to grow in the high single-digits on a year-over-year basis. We are very encouraged by the company's strengthened outlook in the military market. As the interconnect leader in the military market, our team has positioned us to benefit from expanded spending by militaries around the world on a wide array of new electronic systems. And we look forward to continuing to build on this position of strength into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales were flat to prior year as overall demand for commercial aircraft remained stable, while customers were managing their procurement volumes following the recent ramp ups of new programs that happened over the prior year or two. Sequentially, in the second quarter, our sales were down slightly from the first quarter, which was a little bit softer than we had expected coming into the quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect volumes in the commercial air market to increase from these levels as customer demand normalizes. And for the full year of 2017, we continue to expect a mid-single digit increase from prior year, supported by the acquisition of Phitek completed earlier this year. Despite our results in the second quarter being a bit lower than we had expected, we remain very encouraged by Amphenol's strong overall position in the commercial aircraft market. Our high technology product offering together with our strategic relationships with airplane manufacturers around the world, positions us to benefit long-term from expanded volumes of aircraft in support of the continued global growth of air traffic. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very robust 19% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currency and 14% organically, very strong performance, as we benefited from organic growth in instrumentation, factory automation and heavy equipment, together with the contributions from our acquisitions completed over the last year. Would note that we were very pleased in the quarter to see a return to growth of our sales into the oil and gas market, albeit from currently lower levels. Sequentially, our sales grew in the industrial market by a stronger-than-expected 15% from the first quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect the normal seasonal moderation of sales. For the full year 2017, however, we now expect a mid-teen sales increase on a year-over-year basis, as we benefit from strengthening organic growth together with the contributions from several of our new sensor acquisitions. We are very encouraged by the strengthened outlook in the industry market and I would just reiterate that our ongoing efforts towards broadening our offering of interconnect, sensor and antenna products has positioned us strongly across the many segments of the global industrial market and we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits from this approach into the future. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and automotive was again a very strong contributor in the second quarter. Sales increased by a higher-than-expected 13% in U.S. dollars, 15% in local currencies 13% organically with strong growth actually in all regions. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 6% from the first quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect our sales to increase from these levels, driven primarily by the additions of Piher and i2S in what is normally seasonally softer quarter. And for the full year, we now expect sales growth in the low teens, with the contributions from these acquisitions together with an incrementally stronger outlook for our organic growth in the automotive market. We remain excited by the company's excellent position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars. Whether that'd be in traditional fuel power, hybrid or electric vehicles, we see car makers around the world integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. This creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for the company. The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in mobile devices fell by a bit more than expected 20% compared to prior year as modest increases in sales of products incorporated into laptops were more than offset by softer sales related to tablets and smartphones. Sequentially our sales did increase by 13% from the first quarter. Now looking into the third quarter, we expect a quite significant increase in sales nearly 40% sequentially from second quarter levels as we participate in several new product ramp ups. For the full-year, however, on the basis of the latest outlooks from our customers, we do now expect sales to decline in the mid-to-high single digits on a year-over-year basis. Regardless of this more muted demand outlook for 2017, I remain extremely confident that our experienced and agile team who works in the mobile devices market has positioned us to benefit from any opportunities that may arise in this dynamic market. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were down from prior year by about 3%, as increased sales to equipment manufacturers were more than offset by reductions in demand from mobile network operators, and that was driven by pauses in their investments in new wireless systems. Sequentially, sales were flat for the first quarter. I'd say that going into the third quarter, we now expect sales to improve modestly from these levels, but nevertheless we've yet to see our wireless operator customers meaningfully improve their spending outlooks for the remainder of this year; accordingly, we continue to expect the low-to-mid single digit decline in the sales for the full-year 2017 consistent with what we talked about last quarter. Despite this year's pause in demand, I would just tell you that Amphenol's position in the mobile networks market remains very strong. We continue to work with equipment manufacturers and operators around the world to enable their next generation networks with our broad array of interconnect and antenna products. In particular, we're working with a wide array of customers as they prepare for the coming adoption of 5G, as well as other next generation networks, and that creates an encouraging long-term potential for the company. The IT and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter, and I'm very pleased that our team working in the IT market drove another excellent quarter, as sales increased by a greater-than-expected 15% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Sequentially, our sales increased by about 3% from the first quarter. Our sales were strongest in networking-related applications, but we did also realize growth in both service and storage. And in addition, our team continued to accelerate momentum with cloud service providers, really this next \u2013 new generation of IT hardware consumers and we remain very pleased with our progress with these new customers, who continue to invest in next generation systems, to enable the explosive growth of cloud computing. Now with the addition of Telect, we have again broadened our position in the data center, an exciting area of growth potential for Amphenol. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels and for the full-year 2017, we continue to expect sales in the mid-to-high single digits in the IT datacom market. I remain very proud of our team working in this market and they have done just a fabulous job of successfully expanding our industry leading range of high speed and power products, while ensuring that we support the broadest range of customers around the world. And finally, the broadband communication market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, sales in this market increased from prior year by 10%, driven by the benefits from the All Systems Broadband acquisition that we made at the end of last year. Organically, our sales were slightly down as cable operators moderated their overall capital spending. Sequentially, sales increased by a strong 10% from prior quarter, which was encouraging here in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these levels and for the full year, we do continue to expect low double-digit growth, driven in particular by the impact of acquisitions completed over the recent year. It's important to understand that the broadband industry continues to experience consolidation among the operators that work in that industry and that consolidation can certainly cause pauses in the capital investment cycles of our customers. Nevertheless, with our continually broadening product offering, we look forward to take advantage of any opportunities to expand our market position with cable operators around the world in 2017 and beyond. So, just in summary, with respect to the second quarter, I just reaffirm that I'm just extremely pleased with the company's excellent results during the quarter. We delivered strong organic performance, executed on three acquisitions of five distinct businesses, increased our dividend by 19% and continued to return substantial capital to shareholders through our stock buyback program. And while the global market environment remains uncertain, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well in expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance. And that performance is a direct reflection of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diversified markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team. So turning to the outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and based on the continuation of the current uncertain economic environment and also assuming constant exchange rates. We now expect the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.700 billion to $1.740 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.77 to $0.79. This represents the sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 4% to 6%, and 5% to 8% respectively. For the full-year 2017, we expect sales in the range of $6.620 billion to $6.700 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.06 to $3.10. And again for the full year, this represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 5% to 7% and 13% to 14% respectively over 2016 levels. On an organic basis, our full-year guidance now represents an outlook of full year sales growth of 2% to 4%. We're very encouraged by the company's robust performance in the first half of 2017 and here in the second quarter, as well as our strength and outlook for the remainder of the year, and I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and deliver strong financial performance in 2017 and beyond. And with that, operator, it would be our pleasure to take any questions if there may be. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now being. Our first question come from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I have a question and a follow-up for you guys. I guess to start off with on the automotive segment. I guess, Adam, there has been a lot of concerns around cycle and the slowdown in that marketplace. I think you guys actually took up your full year forecast from high single-digit last quarter to low-teens. Could you just help me understand how much of that uptick was organic versus M&A? And just broadly what are you seeing in the automotive market. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thank you very much Amit. I think we had a very strong quarter in the automotive market and we're really pleased with the progress that we've made there. And I mentioned actually in my prepared remarks that one thing that we're pleased in particular is to see strong performance, really organically in all regions around the world. And I think it's a testament to just the continued proliferation of electronics and our ability to capture, maybe a little bit more than our fair share of some of those electronic applications. With respect to our guidance, I would tell you that there was a component of strength organically as well as the contributions from the acquisitions and I think \u2013 let's call it roughly balanced between the two of them in terms of the increase in our guidance. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. And if I could just follow-up on mobile devices, based on what you guys are seeing for 2017, it would mark, I think the second year in a row now that revenues are going to decline in that segment. I'm curious, how do you see this segment structurally as you go forward, is it something that's going to decline I guess manage and maximize free cash flow or is this something unique that you think has driven declines of fairly healthy magnitudes for two years in a row now? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Look, I mean, we're not happy to now have that outlook that it will be down two years in a row, but at the same time, we don't put the baby out with the bathwater. I mean, we have had a fabulous position, we continue to have a fabulous position in the mobile devices market and that is not a market where we just say, well, we're going to just maximize the cash flow. We continue to approach that market the same way that we have always done, which is to make sure that we're creating high technology enabling products for our customers across a variety of applications and encompass mobile devices and we will continue to do so without any hesitation. The reality is, is it's a very dynamic market, we have said that in the past, I think there's no question, we were down last year, the year before it was one of our fastest growing market and this year it appears that it will be down again. I mean without getting ahead of my skies on talking about what it maybe in the future, it's hard to do that when we are not even able to do so, so effectively within this 12-month period. I can tell you that we don't back away from that market, we don't consider to exit it, we don't consider to just milk it for cash, we continue to support our customers in that market with a wide array of interconnect, antenna, mechanical products with the full knowledge that always, you will see new things in the market where ultimately the premium put on the hardware will allow us to realize great performance in a market despite whatever near-term challenges that there may be, so we're very committed to the market on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. The first question is a follow-up on mobile devices market, not looking for any quantitative view, but are there any technical changes that you're aware that you think could be future opportunities for more content gains, things like 4.5 or 5G and what that may mean for your opportunity in antennas and connectors? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Sure, I mean there are \u2013 the thing about mobile devices is there are always technical changes all the time. So we see every year new innovations as well as older innovations going away, and some of those are favorable and some of those are not favorable for us and it's our job to make sure that we're in the forefront with our customers giving them new solutions to help them enable that. As it relates to 5G, there is no doubt about it that 5G has a total new architecture potentially, because it's not yet finalized, but potentially in terms of how signals are transmitted from the infrastructure to the devices. And I can just tell you that we're really working in the forefront of those efforts with customers on both sides, whether that be in the mobile networks market or in the mobile devices market, to ensure that we're presenting them solutions that can really deal with those very, very challenging aspects of what that would be ultimately at 5G. And I think the fact that we have that very broad, in particular, RF expertise, radio frequency, whether that be on interconnect or antennas. It's something that is looked upon very favorably by our customers across really both of those markets. And I know you asked about mobile devices, but you really can't talk about 5G without talking about the holistic system between the networks and the devices. And we're very \u2013 I think we're in a very good position, given that we have a strong position across both of those divides, if you will. So what the technical changes ultimately will be, that I have a hard time to tell you, because I can tell you a lot of those decisions have not yet been made by customers. But our team is there at the table with customers on both sides, working to ensure that we're well represented. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the three deals that you announced this quarter, can you help us understand where the profitability levels are for margins and how much to full-year EPS the three deals are contributing? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think these companies all operate \u2013 I think it is the case, all of them operate below the company average. And you can think about them in terms of sort of low-teens EBITDA, highish single-digit operating margin. and I don't know that we're splitting out exactly what the accretion is, but it's only half a year right now. So wouldn't expect \u2013 it's not significant accretion, I don't know, Craig. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: No, it isn't significant. A I think \u2013 as I would think about this is, as we've done with all our acquisitions at these lower profitability levels we certainly are committed to work over time to improve the profitability of these businesses. These are great businesses, it's great technologies and certainly great management teams. And we feel very comfortable that over a period of time that we'll be able to get them up to the profitability levels that we would expect and then drive even additional accretion from that. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. It seems like you had some comments in the press release and on the conference call that the demand environment is sort of mixed. And it seems like, if we look at the more traditional industrial segments and GDP exposed segments, those are \u2013 appear to be improving and were a bit stronger for you, but the traditional IT segments continue to see some challenges and obviously transitions to different types of business models like the cloud model. Is that a fair assessment of the business, and is that sort of what you're seeing as we move into the back half of the year? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I haven't thought about it that way, but I guess it's not an unreasonable assessment, because if you look at the markets where we really outperformed in the quarter, it was indeed military, industrial, automotive, in particular. I guess, IT datacom, we had very strong performance though. So I don't know that it's a completely true statement to say that it's the more traditional GDP-led industries as opposed to the technology industries, because I think we're really outperforming in IT datacom through capitalizing on that shift to the cloud. But no doubt about it, military, industrial, automotive all very, very strong organic growth. But what I would also reiterate is, this is not just a rising tide. I mean, if you look at our growth in military, yes, there was some component of that, that came from a recovery from the DLA, but our growth even without that was very, very strong in the quarter. And I don't think you have seen for example, military budgets growing high single-digits on a global basis. And similarly with industrial, we grew 14% in the quarter, a very, very strong performance organically, 19% in U.S. dollars. And again, I don't know that GDP is necessarily growing at those rates. Our team has just done a fabulous job in the industrial market, positioning us in areas that we have not necessarily been as present before. And one of the ways we have done that is by capitalizing on many of the acquisitions that we've done. At the time we acquired FCI, FCI was not known actually as \"an industrial company\" but we were very excited at the time that we acquired with FCI a tremendous range of industrial products, in particular related to embedded computing. And so when we see growth in places like instrumentation, factory automation, in particular, which were two of the fastest-growing segments within the industrial market for us, there is some portion of that which is actually organic growth of some of those FCI products that we would not have had in the past. And I think that's really a great benefit that we start to see from having that broader range of products in industrial. And I think I had talked already about automotive and you have an automotive market which is maybe in units, flat or some even say slightly down on a year-over-year basis and we grew in that market organically by 13%, so I don't know that that's again just a GDP trend. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's super helpful, Adam, thanks for that detail. And then can I just ask, there has been a lot of commentary about component shortages and some component issues. You didn't really talk about it in the call, but can you talk through any issues that you're seeing and if it had any impact on any of your end markets or any of your ability to deliver products? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you very much. We hear some rumblings about this. I hear more of it related to the distribution channel and extending lead times for things like passive components. I can't tell you that we have seen anything material related to shortages that would affect our ability to service our customers, I think even when there is just a slight a sniff of that, I can tell you that our team jumps into action to make sure that we're supporting customers in whatever they want to \u2013 whatever they need. And nor have we heard anything material about our customers reducing their procurement of our product because of other shortages. That I have not seen in any real meaningful way over the course of the last quarter. But I certainly hear in the distribution channel in particular that there is some extending lead times on things that are unrelated necessarily to the interconnect world. Operator : Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line's open. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Hi, afternoon everybody. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Hi, Shawn. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Hi. Two questions. Going back to mobile devices. Is the dynamic this year being down a function of you walking away from business where the pricing was uncompetitive and competitors decided to undercut it you this year, was there something in the design change year-over-year with the smartphones or maybe you missed that. It sounds like a little bit of both, but I wonder if you could provide any clarity on that? And then I have a follow-up. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Sure. I mean, I'd say, I would love to tell you that there is a silver bullet here, but there is not, you know it's a very dynamic market. So all the things that you mentioned can happen to you or you can \u2013 there can be also just overall shifts in volumes and dynamics and \u2013 or you don't win everything, as it comes along. What I can tell you is, there is some combination of all of the above that would represent that. I think we've talked about one in particular dynamic, which is that the tablet market continues to be a significant drag on the overall volumes and in the market. In particular, because tablets do have much more significant content and content potential than you would have in just a traditional smartphone. And I think the overall global units of tablets continue to fall. And so, I think, that's more in the category of just the overall market being down and then you have design changes, you have differences of technology, you have pricing pressure, you have all of the above. So I'm not trying to cop out here Shawn, but I would just tell you that there is not just a one driver of that new expectation that we have for the year. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. That's fair. And then on the mobile networks business, Adam, I think you made the comment that the operators haven't stepped up their spending yet was \u2013 did you have an expectation be it in any region of the world where you would see an acceleration into the back half of the year and that's falling short or is it just more of \u2013 they haven't spent and they're not going to spend? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, I think, it's more of the latter. I mean, we haven't changed our outlook for this market. I think we continue to have an outlook, which is similar to what I talked about last quarter. So it's not that we had anticipated something to come. Now, I'm an optimistic guy. So I always love to hope that maybe we will be proven wrong on our outlook and that it will be a little bit better than we had expected and I don't think that seems to be in the cards here. This is a market where as you know very well, I mean you follow that market so closely, that goes in waves. And those waves get impacted by a couple of dynamics. One of those dynamics is the generational shift in the product and I think we are this year a little bit in that interstitial period between generations. The second is that you get the sort of corporate uncertainty that can strike the market either someone wants to be sold, someone wants to be bought, companies come together, companies don't come together and inevitably when that happens, especially with service providers and we see that here and in the broadband market, they tend not to overspend, let's say on capital at a time when their corporate future is not fully gelled and understood internally or externally. And I think that those two dynamics seem this year to both be the case, but looking into the coming years, I would just tell you that everything that we hear from our customers is there is a lot of potential with next generation networks. The traffic that is coursing through these networks continues to increase on an exponential basis. The requirements around coverage, around latency, around power consumption, all the things that are so critical to the strong functioning of a network, those do not abate in their importance in the eyes of both our operator and our OEM customers. And thus there continues to be tremendous ongoing work to develop, enabling solutions for next generation. Our team is very much engaged in that. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. Adam, your first half 2017 organic growth that you reported is higher than your full-year guidance of 2% to 4%. So for second half, can you talk about where that deceleration is coming from or were there any pull-forward issues, especially given that the comps actually get a lot easier in 3Q on organic basis, and I have a follow-up? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I don't \u2013 I think, I've given already our outlook for all of the markets here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And I don't know that it would be still helpful for me to go one by one. But I would say on a year-over-year basis, probably the biggest change between first half and second half is IT datacom market, where we had an outstanding second half of last year. You may recall, we grew in the second half last year in IT datacom in the third quarter by 19% organically and in the fourth quarter by 27% organically. And we certainly don't have that same expectation here in the second half for that market, which is actually today our largest market by a hair here, it's 21% of sales. So I think that's probably the market that has to the calculation that you're looking at, probably the largest impact. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks, Adam. And can you talk a little bit about the geographical footprint for Meggitt and i2S. It seems like they're both like European based and is it pretty \u2013 the sale is pretty concentrated currently in Europe and do you see an opportunity to scale and can you also comment on sort of the i2S sensors if those are primarily high pressure sensors and what applications they're best positioned in? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Sure. So, obviously i2S is based in Dresden, so you can assume correctly that they have predominance of European. The three companies that we acquired from Meggitt, one of them is based in Europe and the other two are based here in North America. So I would actually say that they are probably a little bit more North America-centric in its totality than Europe-centric. And i2S indeed has just an outstanding position in a broad array of pressure sensors, maybe a little bit tilting towards higher pressure, but in particular really harsh environment. So sensors that can operate at extremely high temperature as well as pressure and not have a degradation in the performance and the function in accurately reflecting the pressure even in a very harsh environment and that's what's quite special about i2S and their capabilities in that area. And you can see those applications in automotive and industrial both equally, actually. Operator : Our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. More on the recent M&A, these deals seem slightly more slanted towards or maybe a lot more slanted towards sensors than the overall portfolio, and we know this is a sort of multi-year thing, you started three years ago. Should we think about the pipeline of deals continuing to lean more towards sensor products than connectors or antennas? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: No, I wouldn't necessarily thing about that. I've said in the past, Will, that we can't control the timing of acquisitions. I mean, we do our best and we're very quick and lean and responsive with our small team here, but ultimately it comes down to the decision of a seller to sell and when they're going to do so. And it just so happened in this case that there was this sort of coalesce of companies that came together here roughly at the same time within a couple of weeks of each other. But I think, I did say, three and half years ago, at the time that we made our first significant sensor acquisition, which was the Advanced Sensors Business from GE that we saw that as an outstanding platform for both organic and M&A driven growth for the long-term for Amphenol. And that it was a market that we felt was very similar to the connector market circa 15 years, 20 years ago. And if you remember, the way that I thought about that and I continue to think about it, the connector market used to be a market where there were a very few large players, there were a lot of small moms and pops and small to mid-sized companies. And then there were a range of companies that were also owned by conglomerates. And over time, the conglomerates came to the realization that owning a component company of that type was not necessarily in their best interest, and they couldn't really maximize the value and performance of those companies. And the moms and pops came to the realization that in order to grow and get really beyond the glass ceiling that strikes those small companies that also made sense to be a part of a larger enterprise. And I think, what we've seen here is all of those dynamics playing out in what was a relatively short time period. Here you have a wonderful company Meggitt, I mean just an outstanding company that we're very proud to do business with here, who came to the conclusion that this was not the component that fit into their business strategy, and they came to a very rational conclusion about that. And at the same time, here is a sort of entrepreneurially start-up company that, in the case of i2S, where the founder is still the General Manager as part of Amphenol, and so it's sort of both ends of that spectrum that I talked about back when we acquired the Advanced Sensors Business of GE. And we would expect that same dynamic to continue to have potential for new acquisitions going into the future. But what I wouldn't assume is that we are really tilting our acquisition focus or our acquisition resources just towards sensors and to the expense of interconnect, we still see fabulous opportunities in the interconnect market organically and through M&A and we will continue to pursue those with the full force, and the full level of energy that we have always done in the past. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I appreciate that. One quick follow-up if I can, we didn't have a specific expectation for the timing of the dividend increase that you delivered today. And you mentioned yield, I think most companies tend to sort of think about this from a capital allocation perspective as a payout ratio, percentage of earnings or cash flow, and that metrics seems to hover around 20% historically. Is that how we should think about capital allocation between dividend buyback and M&A that the dividend should continue to pace around 20% of earnings? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Thanks Will. That's a great question. As we \u2013 I think I start with that, as we've said in the past, our capital deployment kind of strategy over time is to have about half of our free cash flow as a return of capital to shareholders and as you know, that's kind of a cross between our dividend program and our share repurchase program. We have been and we'll continue to be committed to our dividend program at this 1% yield, we think that's an appropriate yield. And as you point out that has turned out to be roughly 20% or so over our free cash flow. I think \u2013 we think about it really more in the 50% return of capital and so I would think about it as that 1% of yield and it just turns out mathematically to kind of turn into that 20% of free cash flow with the rest being kind of share repurchases. This year, year-to-date, we've kind of been a little bit above that, just because of, we have renewed our share repurchase program, we've done roughly $400 million of share repurchases, 5.7 million so far this year. Any quarter could be different in regards to that depending on market prices of the stock and different cash needs, but I would say the way to think about it, is really the 50% going to return of capital and consistently staying at roughly that 1% yield for dividends which at this point based on our cash flow is, you're right, around 20%, but that's not necessarily our target per se. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Just a question on the sensors, given that the two tuck-ins as well as the sensor business you already have in place, Adam, can you just touch on just kind of maybe the breadth of the portfolio and where you think you're strong at this stage in the sensor market? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. No, I would tell you that our portfolio is broader today than it was prior to having completed these acquisitions for sure. I don't mean to be funny about that. We have actually now really an excellent broad portfolio. If you think about sensors from really two dynamics, one is the type of sensor and the second is the markets, in which those sensors are sold. Today, we have an offering that encompasses pressure, temperature, gas and moisture position now, which is the new type of sensing for us, vibration, which is the new type of sensing for us as well as a range of other mass airflow and areas like that. And in addition, we're selling those sensors now in the automotive market, which we have been from the very beginning, and across a number of segments in the industrial market. Areas like medical and heavy equipment and building automation, what you would maybe even think of as kind of traditional Internet of Things, applications, now having also in the military market, which we're very pleased about, that's an area that we have been very eager to continue to make progress in, given our overall strength in that market. And we continue to see other opportunities in the sensor market. As we build that breadth of product portfolio on a global basis, we see further opportunities to expand into the markets where we already have great strength through our other product offerings and we'll continue to pursue that relentlessly. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, in the industrial space end market, any context between \u2013 it feels like the cyclical environment is a little bit better, but also there's some secular tailwinds, be it factory automation, could you kind of give some color around kind of, what you see as driving a little bit better organic growth in industrial? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think I spoke a little bit about that to Sherri's question, but I would just reaffirm that we saw great performance in instrumentation and factory automation. And I think those are areas that are consistent with the trend that you mentioned which is, there is a sort of ongoing and even some would say accelerating drive towards automation and creating sort of smart factories and all what's entailed with that. We were very pleased to see great growth in heavy equipment and I mentioned, albeit from a low base, that we have now started to see growth in the oil and gas market and I don't want to be the one to pick the bottom on that market for sure. But we actually had very strong growth in the oil and gas market from those lower levels in the quarter. We saw continued strong growth in medical, which has been an excellent market for us now for a few years running and I think that medical market is related not just to interconnect, but also to sensors as we described. It's just \u2013 the industrial market, the overall trend that you see \u2013 and it's a long and sort of cumbersome word to say but the electronification of applications that otherwise would have been hydraulic, mechanical or even didn't exist in the past, is something that we see accelerating with customers really across that market. Whether that be in a high speed train or in a hay baler on a farm, you just see more and more electronics being proliferated into heavy industrial applications. And that's something that I think our company is very well positioned to take advantage of. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me, first-off just to be totally clear, you mentioned how you beat the high end of your guidance range by $47 million. If you dissected that beat, can you just maybe rank what was the biggest contributors to the upside and why? And then, I have a quick follow-up. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, it was almost \u2013 virtually all organic. I mean... Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : I guess I was trying to understand which markets, Adam? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Oh, which markets. Yeah, I think if I go back to what I was talking about, military was clearly one, industrial was another, automotive was one, IT datacom. I think those are the four markets which represented the vast majority of that beat. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Great, that's helpful. And then just in terms of acquisitions and maybe the differences between this one and others in the past, given the size of the businesses, the slope of the improvements that you can make, would we expect to see it pretty quickly, like within 12 months? Or how would you expect sort of to get these businesses up to sort of typical Amphenol margins? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, I think we don't pin down an exact date. I think what we do when we make an acquisition, the first thing we do is we sit with the management team, and we ask them, what are those areas that you have never been able to approach, what customers, what type of cost reduction opportunities have you not been able to pursue given your size or your position or your ownership or otherwise? And that's really step one. And oftentimes the first step is, hey, I would have loved to go to that customer but they never took my call, or I would have loved to go to that customer but there was a bit of a conflict between that customer and my parent entity, or something like that. And so those are usually some low-hanging opportunities that we take. And then what we do with the management team is we say, look, we can show you many examples of Amphenol organizations who joined at one point through acquisition, had a certain level of performance, and ultimately achieved a higher level of performance at or above the company average. And we introduce them to some of those people who have gone through the very, very same experience that that management is about to embark upon and they learn a lot from that. I mean, sometimes we'll have them go on a little tour to meet some of those organizations. And then ultimately, how they make that roadmap to improve comes back to the management that is in place running those individual businesses. And the timeline can be very different depending on the nature of the business, the type of business that they are in, where they're manufacturing, the ease with which things can be changed if necessary, the geography that they are in, those all affect the timing. But what I can say is that our track record here is not a bad one. If I look at the progress that we made with FCI, if I look at the progress that we've made with others big and small, I mean, ultimately I think we have a very, very good hit rate of bringing those companies over a certain time period to the Amphenol average or above, and that's the mission for all of those companies that have just joined us today. And in fact, as I mentioned earlier, all of these acquisitions, I call them five companies, but it's really three acquisitions. They all join Amphenol with a lower level of operating profitability than we have in the company. So \u2013 and I think all the management teams have embraced that opportunity and that potential. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. A quick clarification question, then kind of a strategic question. The clarification question is on the Q&A earlier, you had mentioned that on the questions about the mobility about kind of what happened, was it a few missed designs, a little bit more pricing, some less connector content in future phones? And you kind of said, the combination of all the above. Did you really mean all of the above or did you mean like all of the above expect more content per phone, because it seems like there is still more content going in for a mobile phone, that's just kind of the clarification question. Or maybe we've reached a saturation point where there's less connectors going into the phone and I'm just not sure. And then the strategy question is, the M&A has been very robust for you guys, especially this quarter, which is great. Are you at a point now where you just need to sit back, not sit back or focus your efforts on integrating them or are you still harvesting and hunting more acquisition targets and have more room to guide just even beyond the flurry that came in this quarter. Thank you very much. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Jim. I think what I mentioned on mobility is that there's different content on every different platform. And one area in particular that we've seen in the past where content has declined and we've talked about that in the past is on a place like a tablet, where tablets went from being very multi-networks like 3G capable to being just Wi-Fi and I think that's the dynamic we've talked about over the years, where actually content did not go up in that case. So it's not necessarily true that always content goes up in every iteration of a mobile device. What is true is that every iteration is different and so, sometimes, there is more and sometimes there is less, sometimes there is different, there is different formats of things, but I don't think one can make just a blanket statement that it's either all going up or all going down. With respect to M&A, it's very true. It was a very active quarter for us and it's been actually a very active year so far for the company, but the way that we're organized is not that we then have to sort of sit back, take our breath and integrate or chew on those companies to digest them, because as you know, very well, we don't do that here at headquarters. We have \u2013 I have eight operating groups around the world and we've got multiple teams who're working with those organizations and in fact, they're doing it. It is the companies that joined Amphenol with their existing management teams all of whom have embraced the opportunity of being part of Amphenol and the potential that comes along with that, they're the once actually doing the \"integrating\" which by the way, is a word that I don't necessarily like to use, because we don't integrate them per se, we're enabling them. We're giving them opportunities to achieve in areas that they otherwise may not have been able to do as standalone companies and that does not actually take, for example, resources from us here at headquarters with our small acquisition team in order to do that, it takes the ongoing communication between my group executives, with the general managers and their respective teams, who are really doing ultimately the job. I think if we had an integration organization for example at headquarters, which we don't and that integration organization was too busy, then you could find yourself in that situation that you described, whereby there was just not the bandwidth to keep doing acquisitions. We don't have that issue. So we have really limitless bandwidth to continue to pursue acquisitions and to execute upon them when the opportunities present themselves. Now does that mean we're going to make further acquisitions here in the third quarter or fourth quarter, the second half? That I cannot tell you, I can tell you that we have a very robust pipeline, but I can't tell you when ultimately those companies are going to sign on the dotted line and agree to be purchased by Amphenol and \u2013 but we'll do our best to make sure that we continue to have those \u2013 do acquisitions. And we have confidence that over the long-term, the acquisition program will continue to be a great wellspring of new talent, new technology and new growth potential for the company. Operator : Our final question comes from Joseph Giordano of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. I wanted to ask about like the guidance bridge from where you were to where you are today. So in quarters like an $0.08 beat to the high-end and then the tax, the 200 basis points or so in tax that's over a nickel and then you get about $0.11 or so to the EPS range increasing with like a point of organic. So, it's seems like there's an offset somewhere even if we consider the M&A as like \u2013 as a zero for this year, I'm just kind of \u2013 where \u2013 is it on the margin that we have to think about that, it's just \u2013 it seems like I'm missing a piece of it there? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Sure, Joe. I think the way to think about it from a bottom line perspective is there are few pieces to that, one of them would be the option on exercise impact that I mentioned and honestly that's really just the $0.07 that I did mentioned in my script, that's really the difference from a guidance perspective for the full year. We were not adding any additional assumption for that other than what we had already included in our guidance, which is some small portion in the second half. In addition to that, certainly we have the acquisition impact. We talked about that being in the single digits from an operating margin perspective. So from an EPS perspective that's really not adding all that much, it is accretive, but it's not adding a significant amount, plus it's only a half of a year. And then after that you have kind of your organic and FX impact, the organic impact really is the majority of that, pretty much, almost all of that really relates to the kind of our beat year in the second quarter. And then there is some incremental related to foreign exchange as well, which added \u2013 we don't necessarily define that, but some small amount as well. But those are the pieces that effectively add up to our guidance from last time to the $2.97 on the high-end to where we're now at $3.10. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Doesn't the beat and the tax alone get you like higher than that number? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: No, it shouldn't. I'm not sure what math you're doing but. Operator : Speakers, we show no further questions in queue. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Okay. Well, very good. Thank you all again for your attention and focus here today and I hope it's a good opportunity to wish you all a good completion to the summer and I do hope that you all get a chance to spend a little bit of time with your families here before the summer is out. And we look forward to speaking to all of you here in just about 90 days. Thanks so much and best wishes. Operator : Thank you Mr. Lampo and Mr. Norwitt.

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter conference call. Our third quarter 2017 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends. Then we will take some questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the third quarter with record sales and diluted EPS of $1.841 billion respectively. Exceeding the high end of the Company\u2019s guidance for sales by approximately $101 million and diluted EPS by $0.09. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2016. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisition and currency, sales in the third quarter increased a strong 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 10% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currency and 7% organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our cable business, which comprise 6% of our sales, was up 18% from the third quarter last year, driven primarily by the impact of acquisition, as well as some organic growth. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 12% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth, as well as the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $378 million for the third quarter, and operating margin was strong 20.5% in the third quarter, which is up 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2016, and up 10 basis points from the second quarter of \u201917 adjusted operated margins. GAAP operating margin was up 60 basis points from the third quarter '16 and 30 basis points from the second quarter of '17. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, operating margins were 13.1%, which is down compared to the third quarter of '16 at 14.9%, driven primarily by the significant increases in certain commodity costs. In the Interconnect segment, operating margins were 22.4% in the third quarter, which is up slightly compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.2%. This excellent operating performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions. And thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average interest rates, resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the year, as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company's stock buyback program. The Company's effective tax rate was approximately 22% for the third quarter of '17 compared to our guidance for the quarter of approximately 25% and effective tax rate of 26.9% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was higher by 40 basis points due primarily to the impact of acquisition related cost during the quarter. Excluding the effect of the 2016 acquisition related cost, the decrease in the tax rate was primarily driven by the adoption of the new stock compensation accounting standard that we discussed previously. As a result of the 2017 adoption of the new standard, option exercise activity have the effect of increasing diluted EPS by approximately $0.05 in the third quarter of 2017, which compares to the $0.01 expected effect reflected in our July guidance. I would also note that our new guidance reflects an expected effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 25% and for the full year of approximately 23%. Net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of '17. GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.88 in the third quarter compared to $0.71 and $0.73 respectively in the third quarter of \u201916. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 21% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016. This strong growth was supported by excellent operating performance as demonstrated by the Company's strong operating margin in the quarter of 20.5% along with the lower effective tax rate just mentioned. Orders for the quarter were record $1.865 million, a 10% increase over the third quarter of last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01 to 1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $198 million in the third quarter of this year, and $716 million for nine month period, or approximately 71% and 94% of net income respectively. The third quarter cash flow reflects an increase in working capital to support the Company\u2019s strong sequential sales growth. The Company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income, and we do expect strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 cash flow. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $827 million respectively at the end of September. In inventory days, day sales outstanding and payables days were 80, 76 and 60 days respectively, excluding the impact of acquisition, which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $198 million along with net borrowings of $538 million under the commercial paper program and stock option proceeds of $61 million were used primarily to repay the three year $375 million note, which matured in the quarter. The purchase approximately $156 million of the Company\u2019s stock to fund net capital expenditures of $54 million, to fund dividend payments of $49 million and to fund previously announced acquisitions of $44 million, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $130 million at translation. During the quarter, the Company repurchased $2 million shares at an average price of approximately $78. These repurchases were completed under the Company\u2019s $1 billion two year stock repurchase program. To-date, the Company has repurchased approximately $7.7 million shares or $556 million under the plan. At September 30th, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.5 billion, the majority of which is held outside the U.S. Also at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued $1.2 billion under its commercial paper program. The Company had cash and availability under its credit facilities, totaling approximately $2.3 billion. Total debt at September 30th was approximately $3.6 billion and net debt is approximately $2.1 billion. In the third quarter 2017, EBITDA was approximately $447 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide an overview of the business in common and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Craig. And I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you on phone here today. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I\u2019ll then discuss the trends and progress across our various served markets. And then finally we\u2019ll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2017. And of course, we\u2019ll have some time at the end for questions and answers. Let me just say with respect to the third quarter that we\u2019re very pleased to have delivered yet another record quarter with results exceeding the high end of guidance. We reached new record levels of orders, sales and earnings per share and continue to deliver outstanding industry leading operating margins. Revenues in the quarter increased by very strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, reaching the new record $1.841 billion. And as Craig mentioned, our order bookings were also very strong with the positive book-to-bill of 101 :1. Our adjusted operating margins in the quarter increased 20 basis points from prior year to 20.5%, which equals our highest level in the history of the Company. We delivered also new record $0.88 in EPS, which represented an increase of 21% from prior year\u2019s adjusted EPS. And Crag mentioned, the operating cash flow of $198 million, which was healthy given the 10% sequential increase in our sales from the second quarter, which was more than we expected coming into the quarter. So just in summary with the quarter, I have to tell you how proud I am of the Amphenol team. Once again, this team made it happen here in the third quarter with these excellent results. So turning to our serve markets, so just will remind you that our market diversification remains such a valuable asset for the Company, and it was that here in the third quarter as we benefited once again from both breath and balance across our end market. In particular, I will just highlight that none of our markets in the quarter represented more than 20% of our sales, and this balance across the Company remains a real asset for Amphenol, especially given the ongoing dynamics that are ever present within the global electronics markets. The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, sales increased from prior by greater than expected 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. And this growth was really driven across nearly every segment of the military market. In particular, we saw strong performance in space, navel, ordinance and vehicle applications but really it was pretty much across the board growth in military. Sequentially, our sales were a bit stronger than expected, growing by 2% in what's normal a softer summer quarter. As we look now into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the military market to again grow from these levels. And for the full year, we now expect to achieve growth in the low double-digits for this important military market. I can just tell you, we're very proud, the Company's team is working in this market. They\u2019ve worked through so many challenges to clearly establish Amphenol as the industry leader in military interconnect. As the overall defense spending environment improves and as the role of electronics in military equipment grows even more critical, we look forward to building upon our success into the long-term. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by relatively modest 3% compared to prior year as overall demand in commercial air remains stable. Sequentially, while we were pleased that sales grew by 5% as demand for commercial jet liners normalized from the prior quarter, this was a bit less than we had anticipated coming into the third quarter. As we now look into the fourth quarter, we do expect volumes to once again increase from these levels on the higher overall production outlooks from customers. For the full year 2017, though, we now expect the low to mid single digit increase from prior year and that includes the benefit of acquisitions. We remain very encouraged by Amphenol\u2019s strong overall position in the commercial aircraft market, and we continue to work with airplane makers around the world to enable their new platforms with our high technology interconnect products. This positions us to benefit long-term from the expanded volumes of aircraft that are there to support the continued global expansion of air travel. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. I just say that we had another excellent quarter in the industrial market. Sales in industrial grew by a much stronger than expected 20% in U.S. dollars and 20% organically, as we benefited from very robust performance in heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation and alternative energy. And I just highlight that in addition for the second quarter in a row, we realized very strong growth in the oil and gas market, which albeit at a still much smaller level than it was at the peak, it is an encouraging sign for the continued recovery of this important segment of the industrial market. Sequentially, our sales grew by much more than expected 8% in what we'd expected to be a seasonally softer third quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels. For the full year, however, we now expect the high teen sales increase. As we benefit from our increased organic growth here in the second half together with the contributions from our acquisitions that we completed earlier in the year. The industrial market continues to be a significant contributor to Amphenol's overall growth. Our approach of developing unique high technology and harsh environment interconnect sensor and antenna products, all while continuing to identify and close upon complementary acquisitions, has positioned the Company extremely well across the many exciting segments of the global industrial market. We look forward to continuing to realize the long term benefits from this consistent strategy. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and this market also outperformed our expectations in the third quarter. Sales increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically with strong growth, in particular, in Europe and Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 6% from the second quarter supported in particular by our recent acquisitions of several centric companies that we announced last earnings release. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase further from these levels. And for the full year, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens for the automotive market, supported by contributions from our acquisitions together with our strengthened outlook for organic growth. The worldwide automotive market remains an exciting area for Amphenol as electronic applications continue to proliferate across a wide array of vehicle platforms. We have enhanced our market position by continually expanding our range of high technology interconnect sensor and antenna products. Those products are enabling fuel powered hybrid and electric drive trains are being incorporated into a wide range of new electronics application and are supporting advanced development of exciting next generation capabilities, including things like autonomous driving. All of this creates an outstanding long term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. And I just want to say that I am extremely proud of our teams who works in the always volatile mobile devices market. As you all will recall, we entered the third quarter with a more modest view of our outlook in this market for 2017. But nevertheless, our team was able in the quarter to capitalize on several opportunities to allow us to realize significant incremental sales related to new programs. In the third quarter, our sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 15% from prior year. As sales increases in smartphones, accessories and production related products more than offset declines in products sold into tablets and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by an outstanding 68% from the second quarter. And I just want to note that managing such significant growth just in a one quarter time period was a truly exceptional accomplishment by our team, and it's just another reflection of their agility in all circumstances. Looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to moderate from these high levels, we now expect for the full year to achieve low single digit growth in the mobile devices market, a significantly improved outlook from what we have discussed last quarter. And this improvement is due in particular to our team\u2019s outstanding efforts and capitalized on a number of near-term incremental opportunities. We remain confident that our experienced agile team has positioned us to continue to take advantage of any further opportunities that may arise in the dynamic mobile devices market. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales moderated slightly from prior year as overall demand from both equipment manufacturers and service providers remain muted. Sequentially, our sales were up slightly from the second quarter. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain at these levels, and we continue to believe that the wireless spending environment is not going to improve this year. And for the full year 2017, we continue to expect a low to mid single-digit decline in sales into mobile networks. I would just say that despite this year\u2019s positive demand, our position in the mobile networks market remains very strong. We\u2019re continuing to work with equipment manufacturers and operators around world to enable their next generation networks with our broad array of interconnect and antenna products. In particular, our team is working with customers around the world as they prepare for the coming adoption of 5G and other next generation networks. And while it remains unclear when meaningful spending on 5G will begin, our position creates an encouraging long-term potential for the Company. The information technology and data communications network represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market were somewhat stronger than expected with sales increasing by 2% from prior year. And sequentially, sales also increased by 2% from the second quarter. Stronger sales of our products that are incorporated into servers, in particular, more than offset declines in networking related applications. And storage was relatively consistent with prior year. In addition, we continue to be pleased with our large position with cloud service providers that remains a real asset for the Company. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these still high levels. And we continue to expect sales growth in the mid to high single digits for the full year of 2017. I just remain very proud of our team is working in this important IT datacom market as they have successfully expanded our industry leading range of high speed, power and also fiber optic products, while ensuring that we support the broadest range of customers around the world. Amphenol\u2018s position in this market is stronger than ever, and that creates opportunities for future performance. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased from prior year by 9%. And that was driven essentially by the benefits from the all systems broadband acquisition that we completed at the end of the last year\u2019s third quarter. Organically, sales were down slightly as cable operators have continued to curtail their overall capital spending. Sequentially, sales were also a bit worse than expected, reducing by roughly 3% from the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a further moderation of sales due to traditional holiday seasonality. And for the full year 2017, we now expect to achieve only mid to high single digit growth in the broadband market, driven by contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the recent year. Operators in the broadband industry continue to restrain their capital spending for a variety of reasons, which includes the ongoing and potential consolidation that we also see in that market. But regardless of all of this, our team working in the broadband market continues to focus on developing diversified new products to enable us to expand our position with service providers around the world in this year and beyond. So just in summary with respect to the third quarter, I'm extremely pleased with our outstanding results here in the quarter. In particular, we're encouraged by the strengthening organic growth that we have seen across several of our important end markets. And while we continue to see uncertainty in many pockets of the global economy, the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well in expanding our market position, while strengthening the Company's financial performance. And the Company\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across diverse markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook. Based on the continuation of the current economic environment and assuming constant exchange rates. We now expect for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, the following results; for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.760 billion to $1.800 billion, and earnings per share in the range of $0.79 to $0.81 respectively. This represents the sales and EPS increase versus prior year of 7% to 9%, and 5% to 8% respectively. For the full-year 2017, we expect sales in the range of $6.828 billion to $6.868 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.19 to $3.21. For the full year, this now represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% and 17% and 18% over 2016 levels. On an organic basis, I\u2019ll just find out that this new guidance now represents full year sales growth of 6%, and that compares to our prior guidance of 2% to 4% organic sales growth. We're very encouraged by the Company's robust performance thus far in 2017, as well as by our strengthened outlook here for the fourth quarter and full year. And I remain very confident in the ability of our standing management team to build upon these results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and deliver strong financial performance in 2017 and beyond. And with that, operator, we would be very happy to take any questions if there may be. Operator : Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer sessions of today's conference. And our first question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Adam, can you just talk to the current environment, I mean coming in much above the high end, 8% organic growth, certainly an acceleration. Anything you're hearing from customers or inflections would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : I think, we had a very strong quarter here and the strength was across a number of different markets. And I would tell you in those markets, our teams have just done a wonderful job. And I think there are, in some of those markets, also good -- there are good trends that are there if you take, for example, the military market. I mean, here we are growing really organically by 11% on a year-over-year. On a quarter that last year we also grew organically. And you\u2019ll remember 5% to 6% organic growth last year that really had nothing to do even with the DLA that was really a last year Q2. And I think we're both expanding our market share. But the defense environment is a bit more of a hostile environment that we\u2019ve started to see evolve here over the last year, year and a half. And I think industrial would be another example where I think it\u2019s not a terrible environment whatsoever. And our team is incrementally doing, we would say, even a little bit better than that with 20% organic growth. So, I'd say it's just overall it was a strong quarter, strong organic quarter, certainly an acceleration in its totality. Now, acceleration for us, our team in mobile devices just did a fabulous job. And I don\u2019t know that that's necessarily a reflection of an overall macro trend as opposed to their ability to really capitalize on some opportunities that presented themselves. But I think it's a robust environment, and our team is really outperforming even that level. Craig Hettenbach : And then just as a quick follow up, you mentioned in terms of automotive growth drivers. In particular, as we look at electric vehicles and anything you can share in terms of content opportunities that defer from conventional vehicles? Adam Norwitt : Look, I think, overall in the automotive market, we're just seeing a lot more electronic systems, a lot of new opportunities, which are not really necessarily share gains, it\u2019s not like we're taking money from other people's pockets here. It is that there's just so much more electronics being embedded into cars. And when you get to electronic vehicles or electric vehicles, once again, you have just new systems that are being in place, whether that's battery management, whether that's the driving of all the accessories. And what we've always said about the EV and the hybrid world is you have a totally different power interconnect that goes into those systems, and that creates an opportunity for a Company that has a really strong high technology legacy in power interconnect, which we do. And I think our teams who have worked both in the military and industrial world developing over many-many-many decades, those high power interconnect technologies together with our automotive team who really has the access into the vehicle manufacturers. I think we've done just a really strong effort and with great results in taking those technologies and applying those into EVs. So the opportunities are very significant. Obviously, there are some things that go way in an electric vehicle. And I'm not going to be the one to tell you whether an EV in total has more content or less content. It's different content though. And so whenever there is changes, new innovation, different applications in the car that can create a really wonderful opportunity in our industry in general, and I think perhaps more specifically. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a good quarter. I was hoping to better understand the upside in mobile devices that was particularly robust this past quarter. Could you give a sense for maybe the breadth of programs that drove that, just given it came in so much better than what had been guided for. I am sure that one or two large programs are more of a collection of programs? And is there any sense on the sustainability of some of those platforms that you have picked up here? Adam Norwitt : Yes I mean look it's not -- the market itself, as you know, Mark is a very concentrated market. But it's also not the case that it was just one or two things. So I think our team is always on the hunt for opportunities, and those opportunities can come in a variety of ways. They come early on as we work with our customers in design process. They also sometimes come when competitors cannot support certain demands from customers, or when designs change in the products, or there is a lot of other things that can happen. As we all know, it\u2019s a very dynamic market, there is always a lot of change and whenever you see that change that creates intersection of opportunities. And it\u2019s up to our team to number one, be sensitized and sensitive to when they see those. So always being interacting with customers, regardless of the fact that we came into the quarter with a much less optimistic view of the overall market. It didn\u2019t mean that our team was not highly sensitive to looking for any incremental opportunities. And then when you spot those opportunities, it\u2019s all about then quickly executing and being able to execute better and faster than competition can. And I would just say that the upside that we\u2019re seeing, both all here in the second half, is a combination of all of the above. Now, what does sustainable mean in the mobile devices market that I have a hard time to tell you. I mean, we certainly feel that we have once again proven to all of our customers the value of partnering with Amphenol. And the fact that we can be there in a pinch when they need us. But that doesn\u2019t -- nothing is ever assured in mobile devices. And I think it's still too early to stay what does that mean for the long term. But we certainly feel much better here in the second half and for the full year in terms of our progress in that market. Mark Delaney : And then my follow up question was on margins. I know either margins are obviously up to I think a record high, but that\u2019s on the basis of this copper headwinds and commodity headwinds that Craig you pointed on the call. just assuming maybe commodity stay at similar rates, how much more incremental headwinds should we maybe be thinking about, maybe on the gross margin line as we go forward as you imagine there is some delay before some of those commodity prices are fully felt in the model? Craig Lampo : I mean, I think certainly we\u2019re very pleased with the performance in the quarter. We achieved the record sales of EPS, and continuing to achieve our industry leading profitability of 20.5%. Now, this actually is a fifth consecutive quarter over 20% ROS and we implicitly have guided towards sixth consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter. So certainly we\u2019re very proud of that. Now I did mentioned we did have some headwind, specifically in the cable segment related to commodities. And certainly, we did see that as you saw in the reduction and the profitability there. That segment we have always said has more sensitivity to commodities than even our interconnect segments, just because of the types of products that we have in that market. So you know I don\u2019t foresee any favorable tailwinds coming from commodities. I\u2019d say that our guidance in the fourth quarter does anticipate at the current environment from a commodity perspective. So I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we foresee additional headwinds from that perspective or additional tailwinds into the fourth quarter. What\u2019s happening in 2018 is yet to be seen. But as you can imagine, our team continues to do everything that they can to offset the current cost environment that we\u2019re in, which clearly is a higher cost environment than we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, just from a foreign exchange perspective, as well as a commodity perspective. And I think we\u2019ve done an excellent job in managing that thus far. But you do see some of that right now in the cable segments specifically. And we\u2019ll do everything we can to ensure that we can offset that. Adam Norwitt : And maybe I\u2019ll just add Mark with respect to the cable segment. I mean Craig said it very well that there was no doubt and impact from commodities in the cable segment this quarter. For many years, we remain very disciplined in that area, but it is also a market. And so we are in tune very closely to make sure that we're going to be disciplined on price, and we would certainly look for others in the industry to be the same. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Craig, the cash flow in the quarter was a little bit weaker and you know that working capital ended being transitory and recovering fourth quarter. I was wondering, is this largely driven by the performance in mobile devices? Or is there something else you can point to more specially that was driving that working capital, and just comment on the overall linearity in the quarter? Craig Lampo : Sure Wamsi. The Company, as you know Wamsi, has historically been and continues to be a very strong generator of cash. And maybe certainly believe that financial - this financial strength is really a strategic advantage to the Company and allows us to respond opportunities. We\u2019ve consistently stated our goal is to drive operating cash flow at higher level than net income, and we have achieved this certainly for many years, continue to expect to achieve those levels. I would note that certainly so cash flow from quarter-to-quarter does vary and depending on working capital needs, and to support current in future quarter. As I did mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did have a significant but expected a normal increase in our working capital to support these strong sequential sales growth that we achieved in the quarter, which had 10% actually the highest sequential growth we\u2019ve seen in probably half a decade, I think, as I look back, so not surprising and we just did consume more cash than normal in the quarter. I would say it didn\u2019t specific to any particular market growth. While as you can imagine, the 68% increase in the market is certainly a consumer of cash. But we did have sequential increases in some of our other markets as well that certainly did consume some cash as well. So I would expect that for the full year and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we should have some very good cash generation, as well as very strong fourth quarter. And we continue to believe that the Company\u2019s strength is its ability to generate significant cash, which we're very proud of. And we certainly don\u2019t see anything changing from that perspective. Wamsi Mohan : And Adam if I could follow up on mobile devices. The full year guidance would suggest that, I think if I'm doing the math right here, 5% to 10% quarter-on-quarter decline sequentially into the fourth quarter from a lot of other company that have exposure to some of the large mobile customers of continued strengths although flowing into the December quarter. So I'm wondering did you have -- you went through a very strong sequential increase clearly. And I mean I understand that sustaining those rates for a longer period of time is pretty tough. But just given the product introduction cadence of some of the larger mobile customers, the 5% to 10% sequentially down seems awfully conservative. So just trying to understand how much of that increase was like largely one program driven versus more broadly into 5% to 10% if you could comment if that\u2019s the right number that I'm thinking about sequentially here? Craig Lampo : I think, you\u2019re in the ballpark. I think I\u2019ve already addressed the question of the concentration of platforms or not. I would just tell you that in the mobile devices market, customers buy from different parties at different times. And so I wouldn\u2019t draw any conclusions based on our timing being one and another Company's timing being something difference. There is a lot of volatility in the supply chain. There are lots of differences about who supplies what when. And I think that when we look at our performance here overall in the second half, it's extraordinarily strong. And I think our guidance would imply north of 60% second half to first half in total. And whether that's all third quarter or little more third and little less fourth or vice versa, I\u2019d firstly wouldn\u2019t get to hung up on that. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks and good afternoon Craig and Adam. Just a question regarding the IT Datacom markets, Adam, which has been very strong. It looks like it's slowdown a little bit in terms of year-over-year growth. You talked about some drivers there. And I know the cloud infrastructure market has been a big driver, and I also know it's fairly lumpy. But could you talk about your positioning there. And how diverse is your customer base, and what's your outlook for that market? Adam Norwitt : Well thanks very much Matt. I think when we came into the quarter I remember we had a question about the second half in IT Datacom. I talked about the fact that, in 2016, we had really outstanding second half in IT Datacom. I think, you\u2019ll remember having organic growth in the 27% in Q4, 19%, 20% in Q3. And so, we talked about the fact that that second half last year was really, really strong comparison vis-\u00e0-vis the second half this year. And we'd actually come into the quarter really expecting to be even a little bit down on a year-over-year. And so when I say that we felt very positive about the growth of just a couple of percent. And I really do mean that. I think the team did an outstanding job to do better than we had thought coming into the quarter. No doubt out it. Our position in IT datacom is extraordinarily broad. I mean, this is a market where we working with essentially every player from an OEM, every player from a cloud infrastructure perspective other service providers. So there is not really one or another that is moving overall the needle for us. Our position with cloud infrastructure player is really strong, stronger than it's ever been before. And this is something we've been talking about here. I think we're running on three years of talking about the shift of our focus and resources towards those cloud infrastructure, towards the datacenter, which I'd say had great dividends for us here last year and also this year. And I couple that with just the wonderful acquisitions that we've made over the last two years, whether was FCI, which brought us just a substantially broader product offering across the board in IT Datacom or some of the other companies that we've acquired, companies like AUXEL and Busbars, companies like Telect just recently, companies like Custom Cable who have really brought us into different corners and segments of the IT Datacom market. Whereby today we have really one of the broadest, if not the broadest, position in that market in our industry. So we feel really good about IT Datacom. I mean coming into next quarter, as I talked about, we would expect our sales to be down a little bit in the quarter. But again, we're talking about versus the comparison last year that was truly second to none, 27% organic growth last year Q4. Matt Sheerin : And then just looking at your product portfolio, you've obviously done some key acquisitions in the sensor space and that's given you some strong portfolio in both the industrial and auto sectors. Industrial obviously growing very strongly for you here. How much of that is due to leveraging your expertise and things like sensors and other technologies where you\u2019re doing full complete solutions and subsystems for customers? Adam Norwitt : I think you characterized it exactly right. I think we\u2019ve broadened our products and we\u2019ve created the capability for us to go to customers, especially in those two markets, industrial and automotive, with more of a system proposition to them. Now, I will tell you that still that system proportion of our sales remains relatively small. But if I look out over the coming years, no doubt about it, we see a great pipeline of opportunities there. And it is already starting to move the needle. So we've seen that, in particular, in areas like new energy applications, heavy equipment applications. And where we\u2019re really talking to customers about a combined solution of sensors together with the interconnect. I mean, you look at some of these new industrial equipments. I mean you take a tractor, molding the field with GPS and with all the sub-systems that go into it, all the sensors even autonomous driving that goes into sometimes these heavy agricultural machines, the earth moving machines. I mean, just a phenomenal range of opportunities that comes into some of those. And that\u2019s an opportunity that present itself for interconnect for sensors and even also for antennas. And so, I think that the sensor business that we have continues to make great progress and it continues to be a real asset to us, not just from a center growth purely, but also from an overall growth for the Company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : If I think about your guidance for the full year, it implies about 9% revenue growth at the mid-point. I assume there is a couple of points of acquisition growth on there, so may be mid single digit, slightly above mid single digit organic growth. Is that a reasonable number to think about, going forward when we think about growth for the business? Or do you see some other positives in the connector market and in your markets that make you think you can grow faster than that. Adam Norwitt : Well, I think the math Sherri is essentially as you said. And I think that I even mentioned we now see this year being an organic growth of 6%, we think that\u2019s a very strong organic growth for the year. I think how that is with respect to the market, I mean, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. But I think if you compare that to overall economic growth, I think, it's very, very strong performance by our team here in the Europe. And obviously, that\u2019s not with every market growing. We continue have that diversity and you continue to see there some markets, which are not growing the market, for example, like mobile networks or a market like the commercial air where we don\u2019t see quite as much organic growth this year. So I think that\u2019s a diversification that we have has really served us very well. And the overall growth that ultimately results from that diverse portfolio is very strong. What does it mean going ahead and in the future, I think, we\u2019ll be talking to you in three months and we\u2019ll give you our best guess at that time as to what that means for 2018 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : Two questions, if I may, one on devices, one on the mobile networks business. You saying when in terms of how you view mobile networks this year. Is there anything you see over the next 12 to 18 month that could accelerate growth in that business globally? I know 5G is still a ways out. And then secondarily, on devices, there is a device that pre-order in a couple of days that will be launched, I guess, later than typical. Does that effect in anyway how seasonality for your mobile devices business could be as you enter the New Year? I know it's typically a pretty down quarter, but maybe it's a little bit less this year for next year? Adam Norwitt : Well, look let me talk first on mobile networks. I think I did mentioned that we're doing a lot of work with customers, both equipment manufactures and also services provider to work with them on next generation programs and products and networks. And that all primarily let me say under the auspicious of whatever 5G ends up to be. But I think you know probably better than I do that a whole 5G, the plans have not fully been crystallized. For one, a lot of companies don\u2019t even know who their shareholder is going to be in 12 months. Let along what network they\u2019re going to be building. So I think there is still a fair degree of uncertainty around the timing of 5G, but no doubt about it. There will be a next generation network, there will be. There is an enormous demand for mobile data, there is enormous demand for increased coverage there is an enormous demand for lower latency. All the things that a 5G network ultimately in whatever form that it becomes are going to satisfy. And so it\u2019s our job, at this point, even in a not such a great year for our business that works in mobile devices, it\u2019s our job to work really, really hard with customers to make sure that we're presenting them with the highest technology solutions to help them enable these next generation networks. And then you just have to build it and they will come one day. And when that one day is going to be, will remain to be seen. Overtime, as having followed this market for so long, you build this pent up demand for the networks whereby the consumers and the data consumption that never stops, it never slows down. In fact, it appears to be continuing to grow exponentially the amount of data being consumed. It's just a question of when do the stars align for the carriers to make that next step function investment and it's just our job to be ready when it come. Relative to mobile devices, I'm not going to talk about one or another different program. I think we\u2019ve talked about the makeup of how we see this year so far and what it is going to be next year. Look, I\u2019ve I changed my guidance here twice to 90 days, and I'm certainly not going to try to do the third time. So, we\u2019ll see when we see in the first quarter. But again, we're very pleased with the position that we have. And I'm sure if there are opportunities that are going to present themselves to us next year that same team who is working on it today is going to working on it then and then they\u2019re going to do their best to capitalize on everything that comes our way. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. William Stein : I'm going to repeat the mobile device term a little bit again, so pardon me for doing that. But I do have a question about the pattern or the timing of the design wins relative to revenue ramping. We're all well aware that these have very short design cycles. But I think our expectation is that when you enter a quarter, you know what devices you\u2019re designed into, it's more the pacing of the ramp. Is that the dynamic that offered the upside surprise this quarter, or were they actually drop-in design wins that happened intra quarter that surprise you? Adam Norwitt : I think, it's a combination of what you just said together with something I alluded to earlier, and maybe not clear enough, which is that sometimes and we've seen this over the years. During the course of some new projects, competitors ultimately get out over the skies and they cannot always satisfy exactly what the customers want. And so, we're always waiting for those kind of opportunities very quickly comes into action and support the customer. And so I would just say that it's a combination of the two things you mentioned plus the thing that I just mentioned. William Stein : One other question and great results overall. But I do want to focus on one area that was a little bit weaker than expected, commercial air. We think of it as a much slower moving end market, and maybe it\u2019s just that, because of the big buffer in distribution that maybe causes some difference in timing with results relative to original expectations. Is that perhaps why you're not seeing as strong results in that end market as you might have expected or is there something else with the pace of new builds or something else. Any clarification would be helpful there? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : No, absolutely. I mean, look, it is in the quarter, as I mentioned, we did grow by a relatively modest amount. I think next quarter, we expect to be up from these levels and we expect for the full year to be low single digit level. I don't think that that's materially different from the overall demand, especially when you factor in that early in the year, we did see some supply chain corrections that came in the commercial air market. We did see as well continued weakness in areas like helicopters and business jets. But our business overall, especially on the large jet liners, continues to be a very strong business in terms of our designing and our position with customers. But the ultimate demand from those customers, I'd say, today really when you talk about the growth and whether that is from a production or from a delivery from a order, and it's a relatively muted growth environment. And it just behooves our team to continue to strive for all those areas where we can somehow unleash incremental growth to that, and the team is doing a lot of work. They\u2019re doing a lot of work on areas that aren't necessarily as long of cycle. Things like mid-cycle upgrades of planes, things like onboard electronics in planes. And so as we think about the future of the airplanes, it's a little bit analogous to that of automotive. And it's all about finding those new systems that are ultimately going to be put into planes and then making sure that we maximize our content on those new systems. And I think our team is doing fabulous work to make sure that that is the case that we are getting a strong presence on these new systems. And we will continue to focus very heavily on the important commercial air market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Just following up on some of the comments you made about the cloud service provider market. Given the growth you cited in IT Datacom, is it fair to say that the market was slower this quarter, not what you would have thought? How are you looking at it for the rest of the year? And then could you just give us little bit of a sense what maybe where technically you're having the most success recently with those types of customers? Thanks very much. Adam Norwitt : I\u2019d tell you that even if our growth was slower this quarter than it had been in prior quarters, it was little better than we thought it was going to be coming into the quarters. So I think that was a positive for us that IT telecom did little bit outperform where we thought it was going to be. I think in terms of where we are present, I mentioned that for us it's all about these high technology products, whether that\u2019s high speed products, which are enabling the transmission of extraordinary amounts of data, ultimately being driven by IP video, which is the real killer app that it's happening together with areas like the expansion of Internet connected devices, if you want to call, the Internet of Things and the data that\u2019s being created from all of these cameras and other sensors that are around the world. I mean there is a lot of work going on there. In addition, tower products for us are really important area. It\u2019s one where we strengthened significantly our portfolio of products with the acquisition of FCI, as well with the recent acquisition of Telect, as well with the acquisition last year of AUXEL. So we now have just a much broader suit of power interconnect that gets used in the data center. And the operating expenses of these date centers after salaries, it's all about electricity. So if you can go to customers, whether those the equipment manufacturers who are selling the boxes or the service providers who are really operating those. And you can present them with a power solutions that is safer and more efficient, ultimately that creates a lot of value for everybody in the chain. I mentioned as well fiber optics where we\u2019ve made just great progress, both organically with our long stand business that we have fiber optics, but also with some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made over the recent couple of years. Companies like Custom Cable, all systems, Broadband and Telect. I mean, these companies have provided us a very much more expanded range of fiber optic products that ultimately allow us to participate again in more broadly in that cloud service provider area. So it\u2019s a part of the market that we're very excited about. I will tell you, it is a part of the market that has a little bit more the properties of service providers, as opposed to OEM. So service providers have a little bit more volatility. So when they buy things, OEM\u2019s as you know, they got to keep the factories running. So they tend to be a little bit more stable. But service providers, as we know well in our broadband market and our mobile networks market, there can be ups and down based on when they decide to build and when they decide not to build. And so if we look at, on a year-over-year basis, the strength that I talked about in the second half last year and that tougher comparison, we certainly saw very strong performance in the second half of last year. And I think we\u2019ve sustained that strong level this year and we feel very good going into the future with our position in the IT Datacom market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Irvin Liu : This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. I had a question on the industrial side. Your strong year-over-year momentum continued in the September quarter. What are your thoughts on the recent trajectory sustaining going forward? And whether you could attribute any of your outperformance to any cyclical end market trends? Adam Norwitt : Look, I think we had, like you said very strong quarter. I think our guidance for next quarter, while may be a little bit down sequentially, which still be on a year-over-year basis a very strong fourth quarter. And for the full year to have that kind of high teens growth for the full year, which is the a nice increase from where we thought it was going to be. We really thought coming into the quarters that we're looking more towards the mid teens here. And so I think we feel very positive about that. When I look at the drivers and I mentioned a few of them before that we had really strong performance in oil and gas, very strong performance in heavy equipment, really strong in instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy, medical. You got on the list just really outstanding performance across many of the segments. What does that mean from a secular long-term prospective that I have a harder time to predict, except to tell you that the growth of content in industrial applications that continues unabated. Our position and rest of our position with a variety of products from interconnect to sensor to antennas that has continued to expand and will continue to expand, both organically and through acquisitions in the coming quarters and years. And so, I think that we're set up very nicely to participate when the opportunities are there for growth. And I think we did that for this quarter and we expect to continue to do that in Q4. And I have no reason to believe that we won\u2019t continue to have a strong industrial business long into the future. Irvin Liu : That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And shifting to IT Datacom. Can you provide more color on the economics of sales to some of our cloud service provider customers versus your more traditional OEM customers? And how has the trend, I mean, how has the mix of cloud service provider versus OEM trended in recent quarters? Adam Norwitt : Well, I would just tell you that cloud service and that whole, however, you determine it, that has clearly been very helpful to our growth over the last two years. So I guess by definition it's a little bit bigger as a proportion than it was say two years ago. In terms of the economics, I'm not sure if you mean it\u2019d be income or money or what is that. And I would just tell you that we have a really strong business economically across the board in our IT telecom business. And that strong economics to use your word really comes from the fact that we are providing leading as technologies that solve problems for our customer, regardless of whether they are OEMs or service providers in IT telecom. It's all about enabling their systems enabling their networks to perform at a higher level to ultimately create for them higher prices -- higher performance, either for the same or lower price but ultimately, to create value for them. And if we can create value for them through their systems then that will allow us to also enjoy some of that economic value. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi, Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Craig and Adam, when one looks at the December sale outlook in total and the December EPS outlook in total, unless my math is wrong, it looks like the EPS growth year-over-year is the same the type of multiplier effect of additional leverage as it normally does see. Is my math wrong or can you speak to help us understand about why that is? And should we expect that continue or go backs toward earnings growing much, much faster than sales growth year-over-year? Adam Norwitt : I think if you do look at it, I think your math isn't totally wrong from just a conversion margin target perspective, we continue to target our conversion margins at the 25% long term. But if you look at our year-over-year in the fourth quarter, I think what you would see is obviously there is some impact certainly from cable segment margins, which we continue to see at the kind of level we're at, at this point in time. In addition, there're certain impacts related to acquired companies that haven't really gotten up to the Company average and since they haven't fully adopted those Amphenol operating principles. And so, I think both of those factors have some bit of an impact. But to be honest, I mean you see any one quarter could go up or down from a conversion perspective. And I think if you look at the year as a whole, we have a very strong conversion for the year, and we're certainly very happy with our operating margin levels. And I think the math of whether or not it's low 20s or high 20s or 30s, I think that the couple of percentage points here or there isn\u2019t going to really move the needle so much from an overall messaging perspective, I think. Jim Suva : So it seems like the fourth quarter is more of a one-off isolated quarter, and the additional leverage or drop through flow through should continue going forward over the long term? Adam Norwitt : I would say long term we still have the 25% conversion margin target, and that's how I would view our. That has nothing has changed from that perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Joseph Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open. Joseph Giordano : Just a follow up on that conversion margin discussion. One like on FCI have you -- is that business now I think I want to say, it was something like 500 basis points below the Company average on profitability when you acquired it. At this point, have you been able to bring that up to the Company average? Adam Norwitt : I think we talked about that as we came into the end of last year that we're very pleased with the team. And it works in FCI and that indeed they did a fantastic job, faster than we had expected to bring the Company up to our corporate average. Joseph Giordano : And then when we think about like a conversion target long term, relative to your gross margins inching up here. Is there like a reason structurally we shouldn't expect a longer term target to be more reflective of a gross margin ex headwinds from incremental M&A that you do? Adam Norwitt : We don\u2019t really talk about gross margins. Certainly from a target perspective, we have certainly gross margins move and SG&A moves from one quarter to the next for a variety of reasons. We measure ourselves on an operating margin level. And I think the way I would think about it again is that 25% conversion margin on operating margin level, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily guide or even talk to targets other than that. Joseph Giordano : Fair enough. And then just last when do the comps -- I know we\u2019ve talked about headwinds from laptops and tablets, and things like this for a while now. When do those -- do you feel like that business on those this products is at a point where you lap the comps and get a more sustainable at least trough in level? Adam Norwitt : Look, I'm not going to try to get too far ahead of myself in terms of prognosis on any component of mobile devices. Expect to say that we grew this quarter by 15% regardless of the various ups and downs, and I think that's a very, very strong on a year over year basis. I think our guidance in the fourth quarter would also imply a very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. And so regardless of whether we\u2019ve lots of certain comp in one or another pieces of mobile device, I think the overall mobile device performance certainly here in the second half has been very strong on a year-over-year basis. And then we\u2019ll see going into next year ultimately how that sets up for our outlook. I will try to give the guidance next year when we all come together 90 days from now. I thought I was going to be pretty wrong this year, 90 days ago, now it looks like actually our expectations coming for the year, we may do a little bit better when all is said and done than what we thought coming into the year, which was flat and we\u2019ll see how we come into next year. Operator : Thank you. And speakers that was our last question. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much. And I would like to just once again thank all of you who've taken the time today to join our call. And we will look forward to speaking to you all again, crazy enough to say it, in the New Year. Thank you again. And I wish you all a pleasant continuation of the day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. You have a nice day.",

Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley Will Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc Jim Suva - Citi Deepa Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities Steven Fox - Cross Research Joe Giordano - Cowen and Company Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2017 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $1.944 billion exceeding the high end of the Company\u2019s guidance for sales by approximately $145 million and achieving new records of performance. Sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased a very strong 13%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars and local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our Cable business, which comprises 5% of our sales, was down 5% from the fourth quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was up 19% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth, as well as the impact of acquisitions. For the full year of 2017, sales were a record $7.011 billion, up 12% in US dollars and in local currencies and up a very strong 8% organically compared to 2016, an excellent performance. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $399 million for the fourth quarter, up 18% from 2016 and operating margin was a strong 20.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to our record and comparable to both the fourth quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 11.2%, which is down compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 at 14.9%, primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs together with the lower volumes. In the Interconnect segment, margins were strong 22.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, equal to the fourth quarter of last year.  For the full year of 2017, the company delivered $1.432 billion in adjusted operating income, up strong 15% from 2016. We continued to be very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement. Both with the achievement of 20.4% on an adjusted basis for the full year which represents the first full year over 20% level, as well as the achievement of 20.5% operating margin in the fourth quarter which reflects a sixth consecutive quarter over 20%.  This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a challenging market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $18 million last year, reflecting the impact of the higher average interest rates, resulting from the senior notes issuance earlier in the year, as well as the higher average debt levels, primarily resulting from the Company's stock buyback program. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company incurred one time tax related charge of approximately $400 million or $1.26 per share resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge reflects a shift to a modified territorial tax regime and includes our current estimate of the U.S. toll charge related to the deemed repatriation of cumulative unremitted foreign earnings which will be paid over a period of eight years. Local taxes related to the cumulative unremitted foreign earnings due to our intention over time to repatriate our foreign cash which will be paid when those respective earnings are repatriated, partially offset by an adjustment of certain U.S. deferred tax balances due to the change in the tax rate. These amounts are the company's best estimate based on the current information and guidance available at this time and represent provisional estimates of the one-time tax related charge associated with the Tax Act which will be finalized in 2018.  In addition to requiring the one-time charge just discussed, the Tax Act also reduces a substantial portion of the future tax benefits from our stock option program that we have called out during the prior 2017 earnings call. Because of these future tax benefits will be substantially reduced and the fact that 2017 was the first year that excess tax benefits were reflected in income under GAAP, we will exclude these benefits in our presentation of adjusted non-GAAP results for 2017 and onwards because we believe that it will provide a more helpful comparability of [period to period] [ph] results for investors. Please refer to the supplemental financial information in our earnings release for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted net income and the diluted EPS for all 2017 quarters which now excludes the excess tax benefits of stock option exercise as well as the other items already noted. The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 including the one-time tax related charge partially offset by approximately 550 basis points excess tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options was approximately 127%. Excluding these items, the adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.7% for the fourth quarter which is consistent with effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016.  For the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 26.5% for 2017 which excludes the excess tax benefits from option exercises and was consistent with 2016. On a GAAP basis, the Company's full year effective tax rate was approximately 51% and 27% for 2017 and 2016 respectively, reflecting that 2017 one-time charge and the tax effect of the acquisition related cost incurred during the respective years, partially offset by the approximate 490 basis points excess tax benefit of the exercise of stock option in 2017. As indicated in earnings release, we are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our going forward effective tax rate. As such based on the current information available we have estimated that the approximate benefit of the Tax Act on our tax rate will be at least one point. Accordingly we have included this approximate benefit in our 2018 guidance. We would like to note that the impact on our going forward effective tax rate are still be evaluated and the effective tax rate reflected in our guidance does not reflect any potential change due to the finalization in 2018 of the one-time tax related charge resulting from the Tax Act.  Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in both fourth quarter of 2017 and for the full year of 2017. From an EPS perspective, on a GAAP basis including the impact of the Tax Act partially offset by the $0.07 fourth quarter and $0.21 full year excess tax benefit from stock option exercise, we reported diluted loss per share for the fourth quarter of $0.34 and diluted EPS of $2.06 for the full year of 2017. On an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter -- fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.86 which is a 15% increase compared to $0.75 for the comparable in 2016 period. And compared to our adjusted EPS guidance in the fourth quarter at the high end of $0.80 excluding the $0.01 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises.  For the full year of 2017, adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.12, up 15% over 2016 at $2.72. A very strong performance and compares to our adjusted EPS guidance in the full year at the high end of $3.06 excluding the $0.15 EPS benefit included in our guidance for the fourth quarter related to the expected excess tax benefit of stock option exercises.  This strong growth was supported by excellent operating performance as demonstrated by the company's strong operating margins.  Orders for the quarter were record $2 billion, a 20% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03 to 1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was a record $428 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year, or approximately 156% and 116% of adjusted net income respectively. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $875 million respectively at the end of December. In inventory days, day sales outstanding and payables days excluding the impact of acquisition were 76, 73 and 60 days respectively, all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $428 million along with the stock option proceeds of $50 million were used primarily to fund net capital expenditures of $69 million. The purchase approximately $62 million of the Company\u2019s stock, to fund dividend payments of $58 million, to acquisitions of $22 million, and to repay $20 million under the commercial paper program, which resulted in an increase of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $264 million net of translation. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 700,000 shares at an average price of approximately $89. These repurchases were made under the Company\u2019s $1 billion two year stock repurchase program. And to-date, the Company has repurchased approximately 8.4 million shares or $618 million under the plan. And approximately $318 million of repurchase remain available under the program through January 2019. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.8 billion, the majority of which is currently held outside the US. Given the flexibility introduced by the previously discussed Tax Act relative to repatriation of foreign earnings, the company is currently in a process of assessing repatriation opportunities in 2018 and accordance with its capital allocation strategy. We believe the ability to more freely move earnings under the new territorial system will provide additional support for the company's long-term capital allocation strategy which focuses on achieving a balance between organic business development, acquisition growth and shareholder returns including dividend and share buyback.  Also at the end of the quarter, the Company had issued approximately $1.2 billion under its commercial paper program. The Company's cash and availability under its credit facilities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. Total debt at December 31st was approximately $3.5 billion and net debt is approximately $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter 2017, EBITDA was approximately $469 million bring the Company's fully year EBITDA to a record $1.7 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and year.  Before I turn the call over to Adam, I'd like to make a brief comment relative to our 2018 earnings guidance. As mentioned earlier, our 2018 diluted EPS guidance reflects an estimated one point benefit on our 2018 effective tax rate from the Tax Act or approximately 25.5%, which compares to our 2017 adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5%. On that basis, we anticipate diluted EPS of $0.78 to $0.80 for the first quarter of 2018 or 13% to 16% growth versus the first quarter of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS. For the full year 2018, we anticipate diluted EPS of $3.39 to $3.47 which represents a 9% to 11% growth versus full year of 2017 adjusted diluted EPS.  I'll now turn it over Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Craig and thank you all for taking the time to listen in on our conference call today. And hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements here in the year both in fourth quarter and 2017. I'll discuss the trends and progress across our served market and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2018. With respect to the fourth quarter, I mean Craig went over many of these details but just to reiterate, our results in the fourth quarter was a substantially stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted earnings, and reached new records in order sales and adjusted EPS. Sales grew by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency reaching another new record of $1.944 billion. I'll just say that we are pleased in particular that we grew organically in the quarter by very strong 13%. Craig alluded to the company booked a new record $2 billion in orders and that not only represented an excellent book-to-bill of 1.03 to 1 but represent a 20% growth to prior year orders, a very, very strong finish from our booking. Operating margins were again strong in the quarter equaling our highest ever level of 20.5% and cash flow in the quarter reached a new record $428 million which is just another a great confirmation of the company's financial strength. Just once again as I come out of the fourth quarter, I am just so proud of our team, our results this quarter once again reflects the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst what is always a very dynamic electronics industry all well driving outstanding operating performance for the quarter.  We are very pleased to be able to announce two new acquisitions. One that was completed late in December and one that was completed here in January. First, Sunpool which we closed on late in the month of December, it's China based provider of high technology antennas for the Chinese automotive market with annual sales of approximately $30 million. Sunpool which is based in the industrial center of North East China is a leader in the Chinese automotive antenna market leveraging its advanced product design strength, together with outstanding vertically integrated and low cost manufacturing capabilities. The company represents another great compliment to both our broad and diversified antenna offering around the world, as well as the great compliment to our growing presence in the Chinese automotive market. CTI Industries which we closed on early here in January is a Canada based manufacture of high technology cable assemblies for a wide array of applications including embedded computing, industrial and automotive. The company which has revenues of approximately $60 million, manufactures its products in Canada, Mexico and China and serve the broad range of important and complimentary customers to our existing customer base. Company enhances our already industry leading value add interconnect capabilities across this really wide range of end markets and application.  So as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remained very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains the core competitive advantage for the company. Now just to make a few comments on 2017. I think very clearly 2017 was another outstanding year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market growing sales by 12% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies reaching a new sales record of $7 billion and $11 million. Organically we grew by a very strong 8% which was significantly higher than we had expected coming into the year. Our full year adjusted operating margin also reached a new record of 20.4% and as Craig mentioned, this is the first time that we exceeded 20% return on sales for our full calendar year. And our strong profitability enabled us to generate adjusted diluted EPS of $3.12 growing also strong 15% from prior year. Operating cash flow and free cash flow also were both records in the year at a $1.144 billion and $921 million respectively and we continue to put that cash to work in our acquisition program, which once again contributed strongly to our performance here in 2017.  As you recall, we closed on the acquisitions earlier this year of Phitek,i2S, Telect, the 3 sensor businesses of Meggitt and then Sunpool in the fourth quarter and CTI here in January. All these acquisitions have already begun to create value for the company and most importantly we've now been joined by great range of talented individual which thereby deepens the bench of our already impressive management team. In addition to our acquisitions program, we also bought back this year 8.4 million shares under our $1 billion share buyback program and you'll recall increasing -- that we increased our quarterly dividend by 19% during the year. The company is consistent and balanced approach to capital deployment, we believe will be further enhance to the increased flexibility afforded by the modified territorial tax system, that's implemented in the recently passed US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We believe the ability to more freely move the company's earnings under this new territorial system will provide additional support for our consistent, long-term capital allocation strategy, which focuses on achieving a balance between investing in organic business development, acquisition growth and delivering shareholder returns including our dividends and share buyback program.  Our long-term mission remains the same and that is to be the enablers of the electronics revolution. And through the organic development efforts of our worldwide entrepreneurial organization together with the benefits from our acquisition program, we've expanded our partnerships with the broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end market. This has resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronic industry. While the overall market environment in 2017 was certainly very dynamic as we enter 2018 our agile entrepreneurial management team is highly confident that we've built a platform strength from which we can drive superior, long-term performance.  Now turning to the trends in our served markets and just reflecting back again on 2017, we were very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification is continue to create real value for the company. Once again, no end market represented more than 20% of our sales for the full year and we remain very steadfast on our belief that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end market while exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arrive across the electronics industry.  So turning to those markets specifically starting with the military market. The military market represented 10% of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017. Sales in the military market rose strongly in the fourth quarter rising by a greater than expected 11%, driven by growth in really most segment of the military market. And that included in particular aircraft, space, naval and communication application. Sequentially, our sales in military increased by a very robust 10%. And for the full year 2017, we were pleased that our military sales grew by very strong 13%, all organic reflecting broad based strength across virtually all segments of the market.  Our team working in this important market is continues to solidify our leadership position by leveraging our leading technology position amid the more favorable military expanding environment. The breadth of our position is even more important in this environment as we are able to participate on a wide array of next generation military hardware. Looking ahead, while we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from this fourth quarter level, we do expect to achieve mid single digit sales growth in the military market for the full year 2018.  The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of sales both in the fourth quarter and for 2017. And sales in the fourth quarter increased from prior year by a robust 11% as aircraft manufactures increased their procurement after several quarters of moderate spending pattern. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2017, our sales were up by 3% as the benefit of Phitek acquisition completed in the first quarter, as well as the strength in large passenger plane volume was offset by continued moderation in demand for both helicopters and business jets.  Looking into 2018, we now expect the slight moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter and for the full year we expect the low single digit sales increase as helicopter and business jet procurement volume stabilize and as commercial jetliner production continues to grow moderately. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position across the wide array of aircraft platforms in next generation system. And we look forward very much to leveraging that position to expand our overall position in the exciting market for commercial aircraft electronic.  The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2017. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a stronger than expected 29% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically. As we benefited from robust organic growth across really nearly every segment of the industrial market but driven especially by strength in heavy equipment, oil and gas, alternative energy and instrumentation. Sequentially, our sales in the industrial market grew by a better than expected 7%.  For the full year of 2017, our sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this is driven in particular by outstanding performance again in heavy equipment and instrumentation, oil and gas and also factory automation, as well as like contributions from the acquisitions that we've made over the recent two years.  No doubt about it that 2017 was an excellent year for our teams that are working in the industrial market. Through both our successful execution program as well as our organic innovation, we've developed a very broad range of product across a diversified array of exciting segments within the global and industrial market. We are very proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. And the addition this quarter of CTI and various value add products that come with that acquisition, further strengthens our already robust position in value add interconnect assemblies for a wide range of segments in the industrial market. Looking to the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate a moderation of sales from current level but for the full year of 2018 we expect to realize mid-teens grown as we continue to benefit from our organic growth efforts together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Sales increased to very strong 22% in U.S. dollar, 16% in local currencies and 12% organically. As we continue to make great progress penetrating a wide array of applications and new electronic systems with car makers around the world. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 6%. For the full year of 2017, our sales in the automotive market grew by 16% in US dollars and 11% organically. Another clear reflection of the company's ongoing progress and expanding position across the global automotive market. We are pleased in particular that in 2017 we realized double digit growth in all regions, North America, Europe and Asia. We are continuing to benefit from our long term and consistent strategy in the automotive market of expanding range of interconnect sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisition to enable wide array of onboard electronic across the diversified range of vehicle made by auto manufactures around the world. We are excited that the acquisitions of Sunpool expand our already growing position in the market for automotive antenna. An area where we can leverage of our industry leading RF technology position together with our broad and balance position with automotive manufactures around the world.  Looking ahead for the first quarter, we expect sales to increase from current level and for the full year of 2018, we expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens in the automotive. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from successful automotive business into the future. Turning to the mobile devices market, the mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 14% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Once again in the first quarter our team just did a great job and our performance in the mobile devices market was much stronger than expected. We grew by a very substantial 69% from prior year as we capitalized on higher volumes of new products in particular related to smartphones as well as accessories. On a sequential basis, our sales grew by a very robust 18% from the already very strong third quarter. For the full year of 2017, we were very pleased that our sales for the mobile devices market increases by 12% from prior year and as you all remember, this is significantly ahead of our expectations coming into the year and even out of the second quarter. Our growth for the year was also driven by growth in smartphones and accessories, offset by declines in the volumes of tablet. I just cannot emphasis how proud I am of our team working in this important market. As we've discussed last quarter, they have been able to quickly capitalize on unexpected opportunities to expand our position on important new program. And reacting extremely quickly to be able to increase sales by this very significant amount. I can tell you one thing and that our customers remain extremely satisfied to call Amphenol their partner knowing that we are there for them no matter when they need us. The mobile devices market is of course an extremely dynamic and very exciting part of the overall electronics industry. Both the velocity of product introductions and the challenges of ramping the customer requirement creates opportunities for companies like Amphenol that can react with extreme agility to the ever changing environment. This agility coupled with our leading array of interconnect antenna, mechanical and production related products, positions us strongly for the future.  Looking to the first quarter not surprisingly we expect the sequential reduction in sales of approximately 20% due to the typical seasonality that we see in this market. For the full year of 2018, we currently expect to realize low single digit growth in the mobile devices market. However, we remain ever aware that this market will inevitably perform in unexpected ways and we'll just continue to reminder ourselves that the key to our success is the proven ability of our team to meet and capitalize on any expected opportunities and challenges that arise in this dynamic market.  The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year of 2017. Sales in mobile networks declined from prior year by a bit more than we had expected 7% in US dollars and 13% organically as mobile operators around the world continue to moderate their spending on network build out. Sequentially, our sales were down only slightly and what is normally is seasonally softer fourth quarter. For the full year of 2017, sales were down in low single digit as the overall spending environment for mobile operators remain muted. Looking ahead and given the uncertainty and the continued uncertainty I should say in the spending plans of wireless operators around the world, we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from current level. And for the full year of 2018, we do not yet anticipate a recovery in the spending environment and accordingly we anticipate sales to remain roughly at 2017 levels.  While this year's positive spending was no doubt a challenge for our team to manage, we are very pleased that we have continued to focus on our efforts to designing new products for a broad range of next generation networks including all important 5G network. Thereby positioned the company to benefit when operators' spending does return to growth. Our unique position with both equipment manufactures and mobile service providers create significant long-term potential for the company. The information technology and data communication networks represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% of sales for the full year of 2017. As we had anticipated coming into the fourth quarter, our sales were slightly down from prior year as stronger sales of products used in servers were more than offset by a moderation of demand in both networking and storage relating equipment. Sequentially, sales were only slightly down from the third quarter which was actually a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year of 2017, our sales in IT datacom grew by strong 9% US dollars and 6% organically which is really great performance given the overall spending environment, as well as the significant strength that you all recall we had realized in 2016. Our organic growth in IT datacom is a real testament to our team's effort to develop leading technologies while rapidly pivoting for the opportunities for growth created by new customers in this important market. Looking into 2018, while we anticipate a normal seasonal moderation of sales in the first quarter, we do expect to achieve low to mid single digit sales growth for the full year. The IT datacom market remains a very exciting place with both traditional and new customers constantly striving to upgrade their equipment to manage the immense expansion of data traffic. This traffic growth continues to be driven by in particular the expansion of video, as well as the broadening of cloud based services. Our team remains at the forefront of efforts to enable this revolution in the IT datacom market. Through their ongoing development of next generation, leading high speed power and fiber optic technologies. Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 6% of sales in the full year 2017. Sales decrease by 8% in the quarter as operators paused their spending on network build out. On a sequential basis, our sales were down a bit more than expected 14% from the third quarter. While we did realize growth of 5% in the broadband market in 2017 with the contributions from our acquisition, organically our sales were down mid single digit by about 5% in the face of a challenging demand year. Operating spending this year was impacted a number of external factors including in particular the various strategic combinations being considered among customers. Nevertheless, we come out of 2017 very pleased that our product diversification efforts in the broadband market have positioned us very well for the future.  Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and for the full year of 2018, we currently expect sales in the broadband market to remain at 2017 level.  So, in summary with respect to 2017, I am just extremely proud of our performance this year. While there remain very dynamics in the global market the Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well. In particular, our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in the company expanding our market positioning while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse market, a worldwide present, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and all of that with the underpinnings of our agile entrepreneurial management team.  Now turning to our outlook. As Craig mentioned in his remarks as a result of the changes in the US tax law, we currently expect the reduction in our adjusted effective tax rate of at least 100 basis points and we are going to continue to refine this expectation as further implementation guidance is released. On this base and based on continuation of the current market environment, as well as constant exchange rate, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the first quarter we expect sales in the range of $1.780 billion to $1.820 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 respectively. And again that represents sales increase versus prior year of 14% to 17% in US dollars and 10% to 13% in local currency and an increase versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 13% to 16%.  For the full year of 2018, we expect sales in the range of $7.440 billion to $7.600 billion and diluted EPS in the range of $3.39 to $3.47 respectively. For the full year this represents sales and diluted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and 9% to 11% over 2017 sales and adjusted diluted EPS level.  We are very encouraged by the continued strong performance of Amphenol in 2017 and we look forward to driving further strength going forward even given the many dynamics across electronics industry. I am confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these new record levels of revenues and earnings and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position while expanding our profitability. And with that operator, we will be very happy to take any questions that there maybe. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Congrats on the strong finish to 2017. The mobile devices business obviously it looks like you gained significant shares, you are able to out execute your peers during the latter half of this year. Are you seeing any expectation that you would see back some of that market share in 2018 or is your expectation that you would more follow kind of market growth of smartphones? Adam Norwitt : Well, I think to answer a little bit in reverse. I mean market growth for smartphones is not always a great predictor of our performance, as you know there are lots of different factors that go into that market growth. But in terms of our position with our customers, I think we really confirmed to our customers that Amphenol is a very important partner to have and customers are not going to forget that very easily. So I believe that we have really created for ourselves a very resilient position but resilient with the caveat that you are in a market where everything can change all the time. And so I think we've done ourselves a great service. Our customers have recognized that. I believe that we'll continue to have a very strong position but what volumes ultimately will be and how new platforms ultimately gets designed that's always very difficult to predict in this market. Shawn Harrison : And then as a follow up. I don't know maybe the word dour is too negative but your view on the mobile networks business seems that way to me. Is there any geographic region that is more negative in 2018 versus 2017? Are you just seeing all global regions challenged? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean I think dour is maybe a little strong word for the guidance. I think we expect it to be for the year kind of flattish for the year which is not quite dour but certainly our performance in 2017 was not what we would have want to come into the year. I wouldn't say that there is in particular one or another geography that sticks out, I think what we see in the mobile networks market is that -- is the dynamic that we have seen many times before when you have both generational changes as well as various corporate goings and coming across the industry which is that -- there is a little bit of a pause and that is the pause that we saw this year. And you'll recall 2016 was a very strong year for us in mobile network, Shawn. And I think this year we saw a pull back in that and we expect that kind of a pause to continue into 2018 in particular as the 5G network as the planning goes on for those. If there is ever an acceleration overall in the plans about various operators or pulling forward in the plans of when to ultimately install next generation network. Well, I can assure you is our team has just done fabulous job of making sure that we are broadly positioned in all geographies. And that's how we've always dealt with this. We've always think about this market as a market where you get sometimes this kind of pent-up demand that materializes over a certain time period, obviously data traffic is not changing, it continues to grow unabated but ultimately when operators choose to make the investments in those next generation network, number one depends on the availability of the actual hardware to enable those networks. Number two, it depends on what's happening with the various corporate ownership of those operators. And number three, it depends on their ability to monetize the increase in the data traffic. I think over the years the operators have gotten better at that last piece which is the monetization of the data traffic but still there is much work still to be done on finalizing these next generation network. Regardless of how it comes out, we've always been there and been ready as to waiting to capitalize on that pent-up demand when it eventually does get satisfied. And I believe long term it will. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me as well I guess. Maybe to start off on the tax rate. Craig, you're talking about I think 25.5% tax rate right now but doesn't sound like it's all finalized. So what are the factors that you\u2019re waiting for to get more clarity if you could just maybe call out a couple of those? And then do you think 25.5% is the right tax rate or does it go down from there as you go into calendar 2019 as some of these things get sorted out? Craig Lampo : Sure. Thanks, Amit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks Amit and with the current information and guidance available to us, create our best estimate and kind of what we have today. There is a lot of moving part as it relate to the Tax Act. It was just passed 30 days ago, a little over 30 days ago. So there is still a significant amount of interpretations and guidance coming out. I mean there is guidance that came out just Friday of last week that we had to process. So that's kind of what we are referring to in terms of we are still evaluating. I wouldn't point out any one particular thing. There are certain provisions in that that are certainly have some impact on us and other multinational companies. But the one point that's kind of our best guess today based on what we know and we did say at least one point I wouldn't expect less than that. So let's see what happens in going forward as we have more clarity on all of these things that we are expecting hopefully will come out from guidance interpretation perspective. So I'd tell you that I think 25.5% is the right rate to use as kind of we look forward here and I am certainly not going to guess in 2019 and beyond with what might happen there. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And I guess Adam just on mobile devices, I think last year maybe prior to that as well when you start off the year and give annual guide, you always kind of start off with a flat expectations for that segment, saying it's volatile to be kind of predictive, which makes sense. What do you see better today that, again, you're not dramatically more positive in that, but you're talking about low single digit growth. So I guess versus the last few years, what do you see sort of different in mobile devices that makes you take a more positive stance and more sort of flat number you typically talked about? Adam Norwitt : Well, I think if you with Shawn's question I think there is something related to that which is we clearly had a very significant over achievement here in the second half. When we think about our mobile devices business, in the mobile devices market for us second half to first half was up by nearly 90%, I mean that was very, very strong performance by our team and I cannot just emphasize enough how much hard work goes in for that. And through that demonstration of being there for our customers and really supporting them when they needed that support, I think that does create some little bit more favorable view going into the year in terms of where we will be with those customers going forward. Again, with the caveat that I always make that you never know in the mobile devices market. We just felt that coming into this year on the basis of all that we know from our customers that it's a little bit obviously a little bit more favorable outlook than what we've seen over the prior three years. Now, I am not going to tell you I am any more dependable on our outlook on mobile devices. I have been for three years running very undependable in those same three years that you correctly point out, we guided it flat. I was wrong all three years. Fortunately, I was wrong to the upside two out of the three years. And I was wrong to the downside one or other. But-- and we've always tried to guide on the basis of what we see at the beginning of the year, that's the best that we can do here. And I think just this time what we see today sitting here in January is a little bit more favorable than what we've seen in the prior three January. Operator : Speakers our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, it's Mark Delaney from Goldman. Thanks very much for taking the question. Congratulations on the strong fourth quarter. As a follow up on mobile devices if I could and certainly understanding there is lot of volatility in that market but generally normal seasonality has sales rise in 2Q and again in 3Q off of a lower March quarter and as you guys are thinking about planning in the year, is your expectation that the build is different than normal seasonality this year? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean it's hard for us to guide for the full year and to guide for our first quarter let alone to give any kind of intelligent and helpful guidance in terms of cadence over the course of those quarters. As you know, we are not very good at that. It's a very difficult market to forecast. I wouldn't say that there is anything terribly abnormal from what we see today but I would be hard pressed to try to paint for you a good picture of what each quarter is going to be sitting where we sit today. Mark Delaney : Okay, got it. And then a follow up question on the military segment which I know you did well in the fourth quarter. Given some uncertainty around the US budget and government funding, when you talk to your customers how important is it to get a full year budget in order to achieve that outlook for the full year military revenue growth that the company guided to and is it something that can turn into any of your customer? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean I think it's really important to have a government that operate effectively and has budget, that's the time that those governments need budget. I remember there was lot of pain that everybody in the military industry went through a time when we were dealing with this bad word, sequestration which you all remember very well. I wouldn\u2019t' say that the current environment is anything like that sequestration. We've been very favorable overall demand in the military market. I think we've done even a little bit better than that when you look at our performance. I think for a full year performance growing 13% organically and not forgetting that the prior year we grew 4% organically and that was including the DLA issue which is year and half ago. Does not having a budget is jumping from CR to CR to CR in the budgeting process; put a damper on the demand for our products. I don't know that we have seen that. I have certainly heard some of our customers in the media talking about how for them it is concerning that there is not a real permanent budget and we would applaud any effort to get a budget done and little back as the military -- military certainly does not like to operate in time of uncertainty. So what is very clear and I think if we look at the change over the recent several years is there is clearly the shift towards the strategic posturing of the military which has more of -- towards building of next generation electronic system to enable our military hardware, both in the US and around the world. And we've seen that just very broadly next generation system new product, a lot of new innovation, upgrades to existing products. I mentioned that we've seen growth in the military market this year really very broadly. If I look at all the little segment that we track in the military market essentially all but maybe one or two of them are up and are up in double digit on a full year basis. And that's everything from communication to ordinance application to vehicles to airframe to naval to space. So we are really pleased that it appears that sort of tilting of the balance maybe away from supporting day to day operating expenses in military and more towards the advanced electronics and advance capabilities that ultimately can be enabled by electronics. I think that's the real favorable environment that our team has been able to capitalize upon. And we are able to capitalize upon that because we've got such a breadth of product and a depth of technologies across the company and across the region in which we operate. So regardless of whether the US kind of hopscotches between these continue resolution, I think we have a good outlook and I don't think that our outlook for the military market is anyway really based on those political soap opera in Washington. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. It seems like the outlook in industrial and auto sort of those industrial focused market continues to be very strong. You guys have seen excellent growth in those two end markets. And you are guiding to mid-teen to high teens growth in those two segments in 2018. I was hoping if you could give us a little more detail on what you are seeing from an end market perspective? And is that driven by a better economic outlook across the different geographies? And how much of that is coming from organic growth versus non organic growth? Adam Norwitt : Yes. So I think just on your -- reverse the question a little bit, both markets we would expect to be kind of high single digit organic growth for the year. And it's very, very strong outlook. I would separate the two in terms of the dynamic in the industrial and the automotive market. I think the industrial market certainly does not have some broad economic tailwind behind it. Even if some of our performance in areas of that market are clearly are outperforming any trends that you see overall. Our strength in areas like heavy equipment and oil and gas, we are happy to have kind of rebounding at this point and things like instrumentation and medical, factory automation. I think not all of those trends are just pure rising tide of GOP lift all the industrial boats kind of trend and if you look at something like factory automation I think here you have a trend that is beyond GDP which is really a shift in places like China and other low cost countries towards automation in order to deal with either lack of availability of labor which we see in many places or increasing cost of that same laboring. Our products are used on a wide array of everything from robots to automation machine that go into this new factories and that's been a real favorable segment for us. I would say that automotive is much more a content growth story of electronics applications continuing to expand in the car. And not necessarily so much just an overall economic trend of automotive. I mean you all know better than I do the general automotive number whether that flat or low single digit or whatever forecast would come. I think for us is less important than the fact that we continue to see just a great proliferation of electronics across car line .And the includes everything from hybrids and electric drive train to next generation emission control to onboard electronics to even kind of autonomous liked application that are going into cars and again creating just great new functionality into demand for new electronic systems which ultimately create a really nice opportunity for our team to work with customers to design in our next generation product. So I'd say that less of a broad GDP economy trend and maybe industrial has a bit more of component of that. Sherri Scribner : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks Adam. And then just looking at the IT and datacom, it seems like your growth outlook for the year is relatively strong considering people's general view of that market low to mid single digit. What's driving that? Is that again from the service side where you commented in some of the cloud business? Do you still see the storage market and the networking market as challenge maybe some more detail on that I think would be helpful? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you, Sherri. No, I think we've just established ourselves in the IT market as really the leader in the high technology product for this market and so I think our team with their combination of truly advanced technologies whether that's in high speed and power and fiber optics or the other relevant technologies, together with the dynamics that I have described now here for several years of that quick ability to pivot towards where the new opportunities will be, I think that has given us a really great platform from which we can have this favorable view for the future. It's more of that growth coming from servers or storage or networking or cloud service, I don't know that I would break it down so specifically but I think the trends that we've seen over the recent two years, and we don't see a big change in those trends. Whether is a bit more growth coming out of some of these next generation cloud companies and maybe a little bit less coming out of the more traditional OEMs that building the boxes. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Thanks. Adam, just question on mobile networks and just the transition to 5G. Just curious kind of what typically your visibility would be into that transition and then once that happened even if it later this year early next year, is there anything to keep in mind from a content perspective or opportunity set for Amphenol? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean I don't know that we would necessarily have dramatically better visibility than what get publicly announced about who is going to build what network when. I think you've started to hear some prognosis about when certain networks are going to be built. Some of them around Olympic Games, some of them around other events and timing. The question is not when the first network gets build. The real question is when they really start to get build in true volume. And I mean you will remember certainly Craig when 3G, there were plenty of 3G trial network built or certain cities that were built, before you really started to see material levels of demand that were representing significant network build out for that equipment. And so when-- sometime you will see announcement, you will see announcements about certain things being built but that won't necessarily be the real volume increases that could ultimately satisfy this pent-up demand that I spoke off earlier. With respect to the content on 5G, every generation has different architectures, has different content, every vendor who makes this equipment has slightly different approaches to how they design things. I wouldn't characterize 5G is having necessarily different content and what we've seen in 4G or 3G. what I would characterize though very clearly is that the performance requirement of what goes into 5G cell site whatever that is either in the base station or across the site, those performance requirements are clearly going to be higher than what we've seen in 4G. Whether that's the speed or late fee or power consumption and those all areas where we have a really great track record of helping our customers to tackle the thorny problems that come as they are trying to break beyond prior levels of performance. And so does it end up having more or less connectors on one or more or less cable or bigger or smaller antennas that is for us a little bit less important than the degree of technology that's getting embedded into next generation system. And we have no reason to believe that won't be a very advanced technology going into these side pieces. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then just a quick follow up for Craig. Gross margins down slightly year-on-year, I know you mentioned kind of the cable weakness and that's an element. Anything to keep in mind for a full year 2018 in terms of commodity input cost and how you are thinking about gross margin? Craig Lampo : Yes, sure. Thanks, Craig. I think that's right in regard to the full year 2018 in the first quarter. I think that certainly commodities do have some level of impact specifically regarding to the cable segment. We've talked about this when I talked about the reason for the reduction in the profitability in that segment. I mean another thing that actually does have a little bit of impact in the short term but over time we would expect to improve upon it is the impact of our acquisitions that have been done recently over the course of the year. And the acquisitions while they are accretive from an EPS perspective do sometimes have some operating profitability level that are a little bit less than or in some cases some significantly less than our corporate average. And one this is usually happens before we've been able to have them adopt kind of Amphenol operating principle and then get them up to a level. And we saw this in 2016 in a magnified effect when we looked at the full year piece of FCI which we were able to get much quicker than we expected. And that's a little bit what you are seeing in 2018 as you compared to 2017. And over time we would expect to get those acquisitions up to the average of the company and but from a long-term perspective at this 25% conversion margin that we talked about consistently I think that some years could be a little up, sometimes little bit down from that but I think that's still a long -term target that we believe is very achievable. Operator : Speakers our next question comes from Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Will Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good quarter and outlook. I'd like to ask about capital allocation in particular the buyback slowed a little bit in the quarter relative to where it's been recently. Is that related more to the acquisitions that you did in the quarter or is there anything else going on there? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relate to the buyback, I mean every quarter is a little different in terms of how we allocate capital and I wouldn't say that. I think we actually had a lot of buybacks happening in the first half of the year and first three quarters of the year. And but every single -- 8.4 million shares for the year so I think that and if you look at the whole year I think that's kind of the context I would put it in. I don't think any one particular quarter. I would really focus on from a buyback perspective or nor I would focus on from an M&A perspective piece. That also has certainly its puts and takes from a quarter perspectives. So overall from a capital allocation perspective I wouldn't take that I guess used amount in the first quarter as any change. I think as it relates to the new Tax Act, we really truly believe that the new territorial regime that is now in place under the new Tax Act really provides us with or further enhances our flexibility that we really think is a cornerstone, one of the cornerstones of our capital deployment strategy. We really think balance flexibility and consistency are really the cornerstone of our strategy and we do think the Tax Act really helps with that and supporting that and the ability to more freely move cash as myself and Adam mentioned in our prepared remarks really additionally supports that as well. So in the short term from a capital deployment perspective I think that the flexibility introduced by act will ultimately help us in the long term. It really isn\u2019t going to have so much of an impact I think on our overall deployment strategy giving 50% of our return of capital for M&A with the other 50% going to return of capital to shareholders and any one quarter maybe different. Will Stein : Thanks for that. One follow up if I can. It relates to supply chain let say performance or a constraints on the other hand this affects you both I think from a sourcing perspective and also potential from the perspective of your customers and their inventory management. We've heard so much about tightness in the supply chain as it relate mostly to passes but also discrete and then to a lesser degree but more sort of concentrated basis in some ICs. I am wondering what you are seeing in this regard? Any sort of characterization of our current environment would help. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, I think relative to supply chain, number one is our team just done a fabulous job and are there certain constraint, we certainly hear about the passes and discrete and some ICs, I wouldn't say that in our company and our universe and our industry we have seen those broad based constraints. There have been some discussions about certain materials like copper and other things like that but obviously our team was able to drive just outstanding results here regardless of any minor constraints that maybe there. Craig mentioned that we have seen some increased cost of certain commodities, and that was reflected most prominently in the margin that we saw in our cable business this quarter. But broadly I would not point to any supply chain constraints and I think certainly none that we are causing and again go back to the ramp up that we were able to drive in our mobile devices market. You look at some of the sequential growth that we are able to achieve also in over the course of this year in our industrial market in mil-aero. So no question that our team was able to deal in that environment regardless whether there were constraints or not. And so I don't think it's impacting Amphenol and it's certainly not impacting our outlook for 2018. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and congratulations to you and your team at Amphenol. I have two questions are little bit related so I just asked about the same time. Adam on your outlook for 2018, if you look at it percent basis about the growth of 2018 versus 2017 and you consider that some of the acquisitions were recently announced today so they will help boost the growth rate as well as some of the acquisitions announced previously during 2017 haven't had the full year. It just seems like the growth rate is kind of down shifted from what it has been in the past few years organically. Am I right on that or off on that? Maybe you correct me or help me find logic. And then underscoring that I think Adam you had mentioned mobile devices for Q1 is typically down about 20% and that's what you are guiding too, it looks like in the past was down much more or maybe just kind of close to rounding numbers. Thanks very much. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Jim and thanks for your kind word. I mean relative to the outlook and I think specifically you are getting to the organic outlook for the year. I mean we are coming -- our outlook here represents organic growth of 2% to 4% for the year and an overall growth of 6% to 8% for the year. If I just go back in time last January, I think our outlook was 0% to 2% organic growth for the year. And if I look at our organic over last three years and in fact in 2017 we accelerated our organic growth. We had 8% organic growth and in the prior two years our organic growth was a bit more muted but we complimented that with outstanding acquisitions in the year. So I would actually say that our guidance here for 2018 is a very, very robust guidance and it's a great blend in fact of both organic and acquisition contributions and represents a more favorable outlook than we've had really organically for the last three years. So I think that's -- we feel very good about the guidance and about how we are looking into 2018. And relative to mobile, I think, you know that mobile some years Q4 is very strong relative to Q3, other years it's more balanced across the quarter. And so we've seen reductions sometimes of more than 30% in the first quarter for mobile and we've seen other quarter's growth more like this 20%. Is this 20% a little bit on the lower end? It's certainly lower than the 30% we've seen in some other years but it's not uniquely low. I think we've had other years where mobile is down roughly about 20%. But we talked earlier with one of your peer's questions I think we do have a slightly more favorable view of the mobile market sitting where we sit today and maybe part of that is associated with that little bit lower sequentially we find the first quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa Raghavan : Good afternoon. Hope you are doing well. Adam, question for you on M&A within the industry. Can you comment on how the tax windfall for some US based companies can or cannot change the M&A landscape within the connector space? Also within your M&A pipeline could you talk about a larger -- a potential for larger acquisitions not that FCI is completed integrated? Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Deepa for the question. I mean relative to the overall M&A landscape and the cash that is maybe available to some companies, I personally would not expect that would have a significant change. And for one reason. It's not that we are now that we have availability and a flexibility that the Craig talked about so eloquently here from the tax reform, it's not that we are going just go change how we think about pricing on acquisition. I believe very much that one should pay reasonable prices for acquisition regardless of what the cost of capital of the moment is because when we make these acquisitions, we are acquiring them for life. At an Amphenol we are not -- we don't view ourselves as a portfolio or manager per se where we buy things and then some day we sell them and we try to market time to buying and the selling of them. We are buying companies on a permanent basis and we know that we are going to be living with the earnings of that company on a permanent basis when the rate environment or the various cost of capital may have changed. And so we are going to remain very disciplined on price. We are very happy to pay good prices for great companies and we are going to continue to take that same approach. And I think as really the acquire of choice in our industry we would maybe set a little bit the trend there as it were. As it relates to our overall M&A pipeline, we continue to have a very robust pipeline. And we are very pleased to have closed on the two deals that we announced yesterday. We have still many more companies that we pursue and follow and stay in touch with and have it various stages of the life of an acquisition if you will. It is there another FCI kind of near and on the horizon that is not something that I would necessarily comment on today. Except to say that we have never had as criteria for our acquisition program size. And so if the right company does come along and clearly there are companies that are of certain sizes in our industry, and if that opportunity were to present itself, we would not be scared away by size. I think that what we look for an acquisition is people number one. We look for great management teams and we've been so successful in accomplishing that goal. We look for fantastic, innovative and enabling technology. And we look for companies with complimentary market position to Amphenol. And if we can fit -- if we can check those three boxes very importantly, whether that is a big company or small company we are going to put our best effort forward in terms of bringing that into the Amphenol family. So we'll continue to work hard at our acquisition program. I think the balance of capital deployment at fragmented acquisition remain really a very high priority if not our highest priority together with investing in our organic growth. And we are going to continue to deploy that capital which as we said has a more flexible availability to it than it had in the past and I am very confident long term we will have great success. We remain unable to predict when those acquisitions will close and when we will get them but I am confident long term there will be good ones ahead. Deepa Raghavan : Thank you. That's helpful. Craig, I have one for you. Is it fair to assume SPC-related tax doesn't impact 2018 or going forward? And the reason I asked is your EPS growth guidance is pretty strong at 9% to 11% compared to your historical guide. Craig Lampo : Yes. So, Deepa, I think it is fair to assume that we don't have that included in our guidance. We haven't guided to any of this excess tax benefit on our stock based compensation. And the reason for that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and we do really believe that the availability to be able to compare our results especially since the tax benefit is going to be significantly reduced under this new Tax Act is important. There will certainly be some benefit in 2018 based on some level of stock option exercises but the same level of stock option exercise will create significantly reduced benefit because of the new tax regime. So we are certainly not guiding to that and we are not included that in our adjusted guidance, adjusted EPS guidance for specifically that reason. Operator : And our next question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Two questions for me please. First just circling back to the acquisition. Adam you highlighted a bunch of attributes for why you bought these two businesses. I was curious from a technology standpoint if there is anything specific you would highlight that brings to portfolio or is this more customer supply chain related? And then I had a follow up. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think with the two acquisitions, they are obviously very different. One is value add interconnect assembly company, cable assemblies is the CTI and we obviously know how to do cable assemblies. We have plenty of them across Amphenol. And often times with the cable assembly business you are really looking for different customer channels, different markets, and different presence but at the same time they have fantastic manufacturing technology and really great high value component. And so that's with CTI. I think with Sunpool, we are just really pleased that we get here not only in automotive antenna company, it's very, very important arguably the most important automotive market where the most cars are sold, sold and made. But also a truly vertically integrated automotive antenna capability and that is additive to what we have had in the past. You know that we've been developing organically our own automotive antenna business and we've been very successful with that. But I'd say this really give us a turbo boost in terms of our overall capabilities on automotive antennas from a design perspective of validation, assessing and all the kind of component of making those products, some of which we were able to do before and some of which we are only now able to do with the additional of Sunpool. Steven Fox : Great, that's really helpful. And then just on the operating margin. So as you highlighted you create the 20% threshold pretty consistently recently. And given the volume outlook you providing, I was curious like how you would sort of quantify that chances of continuing to produce that type of level of margin if you are hitting those volumes. Like what else would hold you back? Whether it's acquisition or raw materials or just seasonality as we think about modeling efforts here. Thanks. Craig Lampo : Sure, thanks. As I mentioned before I mean 2018 is certainly there is some impact from commodities and the cable segment as I mentioned. There is certainly an impact as it relates to the acquisitions that we've done 2017 and we don't project in 2018 for them to be quite up to the level of Amphenol yet. But over time I don't think there is anything that's holding us back since we are at 20% that wasn't holding us back or helping us before we are at 20% level. There is nothing from a leverage perspective that changes anything right now. I think we continue to have a great management team that does a really great job of making sure that their cost in the business are as low as possible given and as flexible as possible in regard to their everyday operation. And these general managers do a fantastic job as they have done before the company was overall at 20% in regards to maximizing the profitability and whether or not they do it out of SG&A or whether or not they do it in the factory or whatever else. We are not really so concerned about that. I think this is an area that we believe that long term we should be able to continue to have that leverage. But in any one year there will be things that will impact it such as the commodities that have had some impact in 2017 in the cable segment and into 2019. And in the shorter term the acquisition that are having some impact which we would expect as we acquire companies that are at lower profitability will have some impact in the future and until we are able to get them up to the Amphenol operating level which we do believe as the management team is clearly possible and certainly targeted. Operator : Speakers our last question from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Most of -- what I want to ask has been asked but I just wanted to square some of the guides on like mobile network kind of what some of the news flow that you are seeing about post merger kind of just illusion, better CapEx estimate or something, is your guide kind of like what's actually been like were there actual actively procuring right now or is this kind of very short focused on what you are seeing right now or just kind of taking into consideration kind of longer term plans and maybe you are not seeing active in the market quite yet. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean the way that we build our guidance is really through our internal forecasting process which is based ultimately and what we hear from our customers talking to our sales people. And what we don't do is we don't read the paper and say, well, we think there is a certain trends that maybe coming and we should adjust our guidance accordingly. And if the overall market changes then we would be very happy to be there to enable that higher level of spending. It's not something that we've seen from customers and so our guide in corporate executive what we hear from the customers. We are as helpful as anybody and things like US tax reform or stimuli or overall economic growth around the world can ultimately drive things like infrastructure spending or investments in network or whatever that maybe that can ultimately have a favorable effect on demand for our product. But today what we see and what we hear from our customers is embedded here and what we guided to. Joe Giordano : Okay. And then similar on data and devices, I think the plans out of like the hyper scale like the Web 2.0 Company seems to be pretty good as far as datacenter into next year. And how big of a piece of the business is that portion of the market for you guys now? Adam Norwitt : Well, I am not going to quantify it but what I said consistently is we've seen just outstanding performance from that. And I think ultimately if you think about the driver of why this demand is increasing. I mean you see just so many opportunities coming the demand for video and the internet, the demand for consumers consuming things in the mobility that they won't otherwise consuming, I mean crazy things I mean now that it appears that there is video game league that are popular than natural sports leagues and people are watching these on their mobile devices, they are streaming them, they are doing all of these. These are all the kinds of drivers that are ultimately create, putting, forcing the data through the network. And as we've seen that shift towards these new web service providers, a lot of the backbone for these new consumption of video is happening through this web service providers, and so we've just -- that has been a real driver of growth and we would anticipate it to continue to be. I will say that as you migrate towards a service provider in terms of their proportion of the market, service providers buy in a very different cadence than do equipment manufacture. And so ultimately that can lead sometime to more volatility. And we saw this quarter in our IT datacom market where in fact in the fourth quarter our sales were slightly down and that's despite having an excellent year going 9% for the full year. But we had had a year before an outstanding finish to the year where we've seen really significant investment in particular in web service providers. So I wouldn't be surprised if there is a little bit more of that kind of operator type service provider type volatility in the IT market for some portion of it. Is it today the dominant part of our IT datacom market? No, it's not. But has it been a real significant driver of growth for that? Yes, no question about it, it has and we would anticipate that going forward. Joe Giordano : Just so I understand is the difference in the procurement is one more just like are the cloud guys more willing to do just more in time and hold us inventory than the equipment guys that would lead to that volatility? Adam Norwitt : Well, I mean ultimately you are talking about someone who is worrying about running a factory versus someone who is just building thing, building datacenters, getting work crews in the field. And anybody who is involved in actually building network, so whether that's mobile service providers, whether that's broadband service providers, whether that's a internet service providers, the cadence of when you build things is very different than if you are operating factories and you are paying for factory overhead and you want to kind of level low those factories over a certain time period. I mean workers and construction project happen at a very different type of timing than do just factory consumption. Very good. Well, I think that is our final question and again we very much appreciate everybody's attention to us here. And look forward to talking to you all here in three months and again Happy New Year and great continuation here in the first quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. Have a nice day.",

Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC Operator : Hello and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Our first quarter 2018 results were released this good morning and I'll provide you some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.867 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.84 and $0.83, respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $47 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. Sales were up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency as compared to the first quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the first quarter increased a very strong 12%. Sequentially, sales were down 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 6% organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business, which comprised 5% of our sales, was flat compared to the first quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars from last year driven primarily by organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $377 million for the first quarter and operating margin was a strong 20.2% in the first quarter of 2018, up 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017 of 20.1% and down 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 of 20.5%. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 11.7%, which is down compared to the first quarter of 2017 at 14.2% primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs. In the Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.1% in the first quarter of 2018, which is flat compared to the first quarter of last year. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million compared to $19 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates as well as higher average debt levels primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 26.5% in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises as we discussed during last quarter's earnings call. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018, including the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises, was approximately 24.4% compared to 23.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of 2018 and on a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 18% in first quarter of 2018 to $0.84 from $0.71 in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods, grew 20% to $0.83 in the first quarter of 2018 from $0.69 in the first quarter of 2017. Orders for the quarter were a new record $2.17 billion, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2017, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $130 million in the first quarter, which included a payment of approximately $81 million to fully fund our U.S. pension plan. Excluding this payment, cash flow from operations was $211 million or approximately 80% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion and $798 million respectively at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were 84, 74 and 57 days respectively, which were up slightly from 12/31 of 2017, but all within our normal range. The company continues to target cash flow from operations in excess of net income and we expect a typically strong cash flow for the full year of 2018. At March 31st, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion compared to $1.8 billion at December 31st of 2017. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the company's use of cash that was enabled by the repatriation of foreign cash, which began in the first quarter of 2018 under the new Tax Act. The vast majority of the company's current cash balance is held outside the U.S. and we expect to continue repatriating additional cash throughout 2018. The company will continue to assess opportunities to deploy its capital consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy. We believe that the ability to freely move earnings under the new territorial system will provide additional support for the company's long-term capital allocation strategy, which focuses on achieving a balance between organic business development, acquisition growth and shareholder returns, including dividend and share buybacks. The cash flow from operations of $130 million, stock option proceeds of $21 million and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $729 million were used primarily to purchase approximately $382 million of the company's stock, to repay $306 million under the commercial paper program, to fund acquisitions of $100 million, to fund dividend payments of $58 million and to fund net capital expenditures of $54 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $90, bringing total repurchase under the plan since its inception in January of 2017 to approximately 12.6 million shares. This quarter's repurchases completed are $1 billion open-market stock repurchase plan, and as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's board of directors has approved a new three-year open-market repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock as well as a 21% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.19 to $0.23 per share. This increase brings our dividend yield back to approximately 1% and is effective for payments beginning in July. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued approximately $870 million under its commercial paper program and the company's cash and availability under our credit facility totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at March 31st was approximately $3.2 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. The first quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $449 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig and welcome to all of you to our first quarter earnings call. Pleasure to have you all here. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then go into a discussion on the trends as well as our progress across our diversified served markets. Then finally I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full year and, of course, we'll reserve time at the end for questions. Now with respect to the first quarter, I can just say that we're very pleased with the company's extremely strong start to 2018 as we're today reporting results that were stronger than we had expected, with both sales and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 20% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically, reaching $1.867 billion as Craig highlighted. And just want to highlight again that we booked record orders in the quarter, more than $2 billion, second quarter in a row, exceeding that $2 billion level. And those orders grew 26% from prior year and represented a very robust book-to-bill of 1.08:1. Operating margins were again strong in the quarter reaching 20.2% and this again demonstrates the strength of the company's overall operating performance. Very pleased that our board of directors just yesterday approved two significant measures aimed at continuing our strong return of capital to shareholders with both the $2 billion three-year stock repurchase program as well as the 21% increase in the dividend that Craig detailed. Just want to say that with this excellent start to 2018, I'm once again extremely proud of the entire Amphenol global organization, a team of people whose agility and superior execution are clearly reflected in the company's strong results in the first quarter. Now, getting to the trends in our served markets, and just want to reflect that here as we finish the first quarter, we remain very pleased with the breadth and balance of our exposure across these many markets in the electronics industry. And once again in the quarter, no market represented more than 20% of our sales. We continue to believe that that balance is a true asset for the company in any economic cycle in particular given the many dynamics that are always present in the electronics industry. The military market in the quarter represented 10% of our sales. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 20% in U.S. dollars and a very strong 18% organically, as we once again drove growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our performance in the quarter was strong as in ordnance, military, aviation, space, communications as well as vehicle applications. On a sequential basis, sales were stronger than expected rising 3% from the fourth quarter. Just want to say I'm extremely proud of our team that's working in this important market, the military market. They've continued to expand our leading position by driving the development of high-technology interconnect solutions that are incorporated into the broadest array of military electronics. As the defense spending environment has improved, our ability to execute on the increased demand from our diverse range of customers has, once again, confirmed that these customers can rely upon Amphenol to deliver when they need us most. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to remain at these robust levels. And for the full-year 2018, we now expect to achieve low-double-digit growth in the military market. Turning to the commercial aerospace market, comm aero represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And our performance strengthened in the first quarter with sales increasing by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically. Sequentially, sales were a bit better than we had expected coming into the New Year with sales increasing by 3% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect a low-single-digit increase from prior year. We're very encouraged by the company's strong performance in commercial aerospace in the first quarter and remain confident that our strong overall position in the market will remain very robust. We continue to broaden our range of products in support of the revolution of new electronics and next-generation airplanes and we look forward to capitalizing on our leading technologies for many years to come. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew also by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically, as we drove strong organic growth across essentially all segments of the industrial market and that included in particular hybrid bus and truck, oil and gas, heavy equipment, instrumentation as well as medical. In addition, we're very pleased that we've realized significant benefits from several of our acquisitions that we've completed over the last year. Sequentially, sales in the industrial market were slightly down from the strong fourth quarter on normal seasonality. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels as we capitalize on our broad technological strength across the many various segments of the worldwide industrial market. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect sales growth in the mid-teens. The diversified industrial market remains a great strength for Amphenol. The combination of our broad array of interconnect, antenna and sensor products, our access to and support of a very broad range of segments, as well as the company's geographical reach, have all positioned Amphenol strongly for the future in the industrial market. And as electronics continue to transform industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. As we had expected coming into the quarter our sales again grew strongly in the automotive market, growing by 26% in U.S. dollars, 17% in local currencies, and 10% organically. Importantly, we did grow again in double-digits in all three of the major geographical regions : North America, Asia and Europe. Sequentially, our sales grew by 6% from the fourth quarter with the benefits from the Sunpool acquisition that we completed just at the end of December. We remain excited by the company's excellent and growing position in the automotive market. Our continually expanding range of Interconnect Products, which include discrete connectors as well as complex interconnect assemblies, together with our broad range of automotive sensors and our strengthened position in automotive antennas, positions us to take advantage of the multitude of opportunities to enable new electronics in cars. Whether in traditional fuel-powered hybrid or electric vehicles, carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into virtually every function in the automobile. And this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for the company. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow moderately from these levels. And for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect sales growth in the high-teens. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales, once again, grew very strongly from prior year, rising by an outstanding 68% from first quarter 2017 levels, as significantly stronger sales of products used in smartphones as well as production-related products were partially offset by softness in tablets. As we had expected coming into the quarter, our sales were down from the fourth quarter by 25% sequentially due to the typical seasonality that we see at the beginning of the year. I would just note that this was roughly the same sequential decline that we experienced last year. Our performance over the last several quarters has truly reconfirmed the extraordinary abilities of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market. The reactivity and meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes, has secured our leading position in this important market. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to reduce from these levels as volumes moderate for several new product ramps. Nevertheless, given our position on a number of new programs to be launched later this year, and, of course, understanding, as always, that the mobile devices market is inherently difficult to predict, we now expect sales to increase in the mid- to high-single-digits for the full year 2018, and that compares to our previous outlook of low-single-digit growth. We're encouraged by the strengthened outlook in the mobile devices market, and we look forward to realizing continued benefits from our strong position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales were a bit better than expected, rising by 2% from both prior year and prior quarter. Growth in our sales with service providers more than offset a moderation of demand from OEMs. Given that somewhat stronger performance in the quarter, we now expect to achieve low-single-digit growth for the full-year 2018 in the mobile networks market. And looking into the second quarter, we expect a mid-single-digit sales increase from Q1 levels. I will say that while we're encouraged by our strengthened outlook in the mobile networks market, we don't believe that this yet marks a change in the overall outlook for carrier spending and does not yet reflect any meaningful benefits from prospective or future investments in 5G networks. Nevertheless, we continue to work on a wide range of next-generation systems with our customers around the world, and we are very encouraged by the strength of our position with both interconnect products and antennas for OEMs and operators. And we look forward to realizing the benefits from such strength for many years to come. With the acceleration of video and data traffic through mobile networks, together with increasing demands for coverage, our company is well positioned to capitalize on whatever investments will be made in next-generation wireless networks in the future. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and we are pleased that our performance was a bit better than expected in the first quarter with sales growing slightly from prior year and declining a less-than-expected 3% from the fourth quarter, a typically softer quarter in IT/Datacom. Our year-over-year growth in servers and storage systems was almost fully offset by reduction in sales of our products incorporated into networking equipment. We remain very confident in our strength in the exciting IT/Datacom market, and the nucleus of the strength of that position is our industry-leading range of advanced technology, high-speed power and fiber optics products. These products are used in a wide array of equipment made by global OEMs as well as used in data centers of our web service provider customers. With the dramatic expansion of data traffic around the world, we look forward to realizing the benefits of that position for many years to come. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase from these levels, and for the full-year 2018, we continue to expect low- to mid-single digit sales growth. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market reduced from prior year by 6% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales rose slightly from the seasonally softer fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we expect a significant seasonal increase in our sales as broadband operators accelerated investments in their data and video delivery networks. And for the full-year 2018, we now expect a low-single digit increase in sales. We remain very pleased with our position in the broadband market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. There's still the possibility of more consolidation in the broadband industry, and as you know, that always has the potential to create pauses in capital investment. But, nevertheless, we are encouraged by the modestly more positive environment that we see here in 2018. And we look forward to continuing to diversify and strengthen our product offering to this market for many years to come. So, just in summary, I can just say that I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong start to the year here in 2018. And while the global market environment remains very dynamic, I'm just so proud that the Amphenol organization is executing extraordinarily well and expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, our agile, entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, and assuming there are no significant changes to the current economic or geopolitical environment, and based as always on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter and full-year 2018 the following. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.855 billion to $1.895 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.83 to $0.85. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 11% to 14% and 12% to 15%, respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $7.630 billion to $7.750 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.49 to $3.55. And for the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 11% and 12% to 14% over 2017 levels, respectively. On an organic basis, our new outlook now represents full year sales growth of 4% to 6%, which is an increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 2% to 4%. We're very encouraged by the company's strong start to 2018 as well as our improved guidance. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon this excellent start for the company by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position while also delivering strong financial performance in 2018 and beyond. So with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that may be there. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess a question and a follow-up for me. To start with, I had one on the mobile device side. The uptick that you're talking about for the full year, it's really \u2013 I think it's all happening in the back half, September, December quarters. But this uptick is it more a reflection that you feel better about what unit numbers will do for your customer base? Or are you feeling more confident about the content you have per unit that's driving that uptick? Just between those two factors, what's driving it? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Amit. I think you're correct in assuming that that is the back half, which is not surprising. If you look at our performance last year, I think we grew somewhere in the mid 90%, second half to first half. I don't think we have that same expectation this year. But as normal, we would expect that to be back half. I think we are not making a prognosis here necessarily on unit volumes. Rather, I think what has given us the comfort to strengthen our outlook is just the strength of our position on the various programs in which we are participating. And whether that is content, whether that is allocation, it's just an overall sense of the strength of our position. Last year was a fabulous year for us in mobile devices. We had come into the year, as you know very well, with a less sanguine outlook. And then over the course of the year, we were able to capitalize on some opportunities that really were there in support of several of our customers. And I think that everybody asked the question coming into this year, does that have some ability to perpetuate itself with those customers who are happy that you worked so closely and effectively with them. And I think our team's done a great job to confirm that we do, indeed, have a very strong position with a number of those customers. And that's what's reflected here in these numbers. And again, I will always say relative to mobile devices that it is an inherently very challenging market to forecast, and we always try to give you our best view of what we see at the time of our earnings release. And we're pleased that at least at this point, we feel like we have a little bit of a stronger position than we did 90 days ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. Please mute your line. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Want to focus, Adam, on just IT/Datacom, if we look at some of the strengths in hyperscale, Google CapEx just this week, even traditional enterprise looking a bit better from a spend. So just wanted to get your thoughts, I know you're more focused on the hyperscale, but just overall in IT/Datacom, how you're seeing that market today and as you go through the year? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think as I talked about in my prepared remarks, IT/Datacom was modestly better performance in the first quarter for us than we had thought coming into the year. So we continue to feel like we have a fantastic position in IT/Datacom. Our outlook for the second quarter is to grow from these levels, and our outlook for the full year is to have kind of mid-single-digit growth from prior year. I think we've demonstrated over a number of years that our team, working in IT/Datacom, has just done an outstanding job of really pivoting towards some of those opportunities that are encompassed in some of the names that you talked about, and more broadly than that, into the overall service provider market in IT/Datacom while not losing sight of the importance of our work that we do with OEMs around the world. And as we look at our program win rates with customers, as we look at our support of customers when they need us most, when they're ramping up, when they're building new data centers, when they're releasing new products, there's no question that our position in the IT/Datacom market today is really stronger than it's ever been before. And so we look forward to more spending that will come. I think sitting where we sit today, I think the guidance that we've given is a strong guidance. And if there arise any opportunities to do better than that, you can bet we're going to be very well poised to do so. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you, Craig. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Thanks and good afternoon, Craig and Adam. Just a question, Craig, on the margin, the operating margin, if you sort of back into the number based on midpoint of EPS and revenue, it looks like operating margin year-over-year will be flat to down slightly. I'm just trying to reconcile that. You've been growing margins modestly every quarter. Are there any kind of headwinds in terms of investments or commodity costs? I know you talked about some commodity headwinds in the Cable business. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Yes, thanks, Matt, appreciate the question. Actually obviously, we don't guide specifically to operating margins, but I would say actually, our guidance does have an assumption that there is actually going to be some expansion in the margin at some level year-over-year. And we were certainly very proud that achieving the 20.2% that we achieved in the first quarter. As we have talked about before and you would certainly see a little bit in certainly the first quarter and even maybe the second quarter, a little bit results that would have had a little bit of a commodity headwind with regards to our Cable segment, which we certainly talked about, and I did talk about in my prepared remarks, in addition to some of the newly acquired companies that we acquired last year that are at a bit lower profitability levels that certainly are accretive from an EPS perspective, but certainly, aren't quite yet up to our operating margins from an overall company average perspective. So, and we do expect over time to certainly get them to that level as they certainly adapt that operating discipline that we have hopes that they will do. So, but I'd say in the second quarter, we're certainly optimistic about their operating margins. And we do expect some expansion. And certainly, if you look at our full year guidance, we also have kind of a typical kind of conversion, long-term conversion, 25% target. And I would say for the full year, we're kind of in that range. That's obviously higher or lower in any one particular year. But over time, this is certainly a conversion that we would expect to be able to continue to achieve. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. One for Craig and one for Adam, if I could. Craig, as you look at this $2 billion in new repurchase authorization, I mean, your last one, you completed that, you had announced a two-year timeframe, you finished that in five quarters. How should we think about the cadence of share repurchases for this $2 billion? And the magnitude of that step-up \u2013 is that sort of just a reflection of the longer-term confidence? Or is it meant to signal any change in your longer-term M&A strategy? And I have a follow-up for Adam. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Sure. Thanks a lot, Wamsi. In regards to the program and the cadence, we're certainly very happy to be able to announce this $2 billion program. And it's a three-year program, which is a little bit longer of a program in terms of the term than we had historically done. But we thought certainly this was an appropriate time to increase the size of the program. I think if you think about our share return or return of capital to shareholders, our strategy over time continues to be kind of returning our capital, about 50% of our free cash flow over time to our shareholders. And we certainly have been able to do that over time. And this really doesn't change that. And in terms of cadence, I would say that it doesn't indicate that we're going to do that evenly or not. This buyback could be lumpy. It depends on a number of factors. It depends on other cash needs. It depends on M&A activity. It depends on certainly market price of the stock. It depends on a whole host of different factors that we consider when we're buying back stock. And certainly, we'll continue to consider those things. But I think what you see over time is that we've been able to do all of what we do in terms of deployment of capital, which is a very balanced approach of returning capital to shareholders and performing our M&A activities. And we have been able to kind of balance all of that. So whether or not that happens sooner than that three-year term, I certainly wouldn't say that at this point in time. But certainly we'll continue to look at the opportunities to buy back shares and ensure that our balanced and flexible approach around our deployment of our capital continues to be maintained as it has been over many years. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks, Craig. And, Adam, as a follow-up, how are you viewing your China exposure relative to some of the trade rhetoric risk? And how are you planning for any contingencies, if anything, at this point? Or do you think it's just too early at this point to take a longer-term view on that? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. I mean, obviously, we are very sensitive and watching all of the news. And I can just tell you that as a global electronics company you can imagine that we are actively monitoring all of these policy dynamics. And beyond just monitoring it, we continue to lend our voice to those and many other companies who have a belief that ultimately free trade is a positive force for the world, not just for our global electronics industry. It's a good thing for our customers, for end consumers as well as for our employees and the other stakeholders in Amphenol. And if I look at what has been talked about so far, at this point, we don't believe that any of the policies that have been announced would have any material negative financial impact on the company. But, more importantly, we remain very committed to ensuring that we and our customers around the world are not going to be negatively impacted by any potential changes. And the most important part of that is that we are prepared to react in our typical fast and flexible manner to whatever comes our way. I mean, you know very well that the entrepreneurial culture that we have is actually uniquely suited to times like this where sometimes, you can't exactly predict what's going to come along. And we have this team of more than 100 general managers around the world, and they're always poised to react to any changes that are there. I mean, specific to China, I will tell you that we are in China, like we are in every other country, a very local participant in the market. And we are not a company that is staffed by a bunch of expats flying around the world. And while we may be a U.S.-headquartered company, our team in China is Chinese, and our team in India is Indian, and our team in Germany is German. And so we are viewed by customers really as a local and trusted partner in helping to make their electronics equipment higher performing and ultimately, allowing them to send more. Of course, we will comply with whatever laws are put in place, and we will react to those in our typical manner. But at this point, I think it's a little too early to give a kind of prognosis about what will ultimately happen. It's a little bit all over the place, I would say. And so we're just going to stay agile, stay flexible and keep supporting our customers wherever they may be. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Just thinking about the full year guidance and the implications for the linearity for the year, it seems like if you look at the EPS guide, you guys beat by about $0.04 in the first quarter. The second quarter guide is about flat with the Street. It implies about a $0.05 increase in the back half of the year to EPS. But the sales guidance doesn't reflect all of that upside you saw in 1Q. Can you maybe give us some thoughts on what drives that linearity? And how much of the buyback is reflected in that $0.05 in the second half? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Sure, Sherri. Thanks. I'll take that. I'm not sure I'm quite getting into the same math, but we did beat by actually \u2013 on the high end, we beat by $0.03 on our almost $50 million beat on the high end. And then we raised, obviously, $150 million, and we raised, I guess, on the high end by about $0.08. So I think that that is pretty consistent with our typical conversion in terms of how we think about converting our revenue into ultimately the bottom line, and ultimately, EPS. So I think that there isn't anything, I guess, special or something that would point out as being abnormal about that in regarding to our overall \u2013 and certainly, we're extremely happy to be able to and pleased to be able to raise our guidance and continue to convert very strongly on the bottom line. And I think it indicates, as I mentioned in my prior remarks, about very strong operating margins for the year any conversion. So anyway, so I think that certainly very happy with the results, and we do think it's kind of a typical beat on the high end in regards to its translation at the EPS level. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just quickly on the Mobile Devices segment, I think you guys had expected that to be down 20% sequentially, and it was down 25%. Can you maybe give us some details on the puts and takes on what drove that a little bit lower than your expectations? You guys have already commented on the full year. So I think I understand the full year. Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, thanks very much, Sherri. I wouldn't comment on anything significant. I think maybe just overall volumes were a little bit lower than we had expected. But I think in a typical first quarter, like I said, last year, first quarter was also down 25%. We said we thought it would be approximately 20%. 25% was maybe slightly more than approximately 20%. But nothing material or meaningful was very different. So, I guess, at the end of the day, it was just a little bit lower volume, but nothing of note. Operator : Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Hi, Adam and Craig, congrats on the results. Two questions, if I may... R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Shawn. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks. First, Adam, just on the defense business, the DOD budget went up I think after you guys guided for the year. And was wondering if you saw any of that benefit in the March quarter, if that increase would still be coming to you later as the year progresses? And then second, Craig, just the $100 million on M&A in the quarter, I didn't see any deals that were announced. I was wondering if that was maybe just earn-outs or for prior deals? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. So let me first talk about the defense budget. It's true. As we released our earnings 90 days ago, there was still this hot debate on Capitol Hill about continuing resolutions and whether there would, in fact, be a permanent budget. And we were very pleased like everyone that there is, in fact, a budget that we can all kind of base our businesses upon, and which did include, as you correctly point out, an increase in the defense budget. I think our performance in the first quarter; I don't know that that had any relation to the defense budget being passed. We did upgrade our outlook for the year. And whether that is related to the budget, it's related to what we hear from our customers. So we are not forecasting our defense business based on kind of macro trends. We forecast it based on what we hear from our customers. Now, are our customers spending more with us because they're getting more from at least in the case of the U.S., the U.S. Department of Defense, I think it's not crazy to think that that could be some relation to that. So we've actually seen strong performance in our military business on a global basis and all those geographies where we can and do participate. And if you look at our performance, 18% organic growth in the quarter and outlook for the year to be in low double digits, I mean, this is just very, very strong performance and a confirmation of the depth and breadth of our position in the military market. And so to the extent that there is more money being spent and to the extent that that more money is being spent on upgrades of systems, on new electronic systems, I think there's no doubt about it that we'll be there to participate in that, and look forward to it. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: And as it relates to the acquisition payments on the cash flow, as you recall, we announced the CTI acquisition in our January guidance, which actually closed in January. So a large portion of that on the cash flow related to that acquisition, in addition to some deferred purchase payments on some acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. A question for Adam, and then I have a question for Craig. Adam, when we think about the operating results of your company, they were very strong. But one has to also think about total company operating margins, about flattish year-over-year. But Cable Products were down year-over-year on revenues higher. Is that cost of goods sold a little bit higher? Or are you integrating some acquisitions or some timing? Or what's the real swing factors we should kind of list as far as operating margin impacts going forward? And then, Craig, just to make sure for the stock buyback and dividend it sounds like \u2013 or maybe this is Adam also \u2013 maybe this is more of a don't put M&A on the hold, it's just the cash flows are strong enough to support continued M&A as well as stock buyback and dividends, is that correct? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yes. Well, Jim, just very simply put, that's correct. We're not putting M&A on hold. To answer your second question, we always prioritize M&A as well as our organic investments, but the company is a fabulous generator of cash. And we believe that a balanced return of capital to shareholders, together with a prioritization of our M&A program, is the right way to manage our capital structure. And it's a very consistent approach that we have taken. Relative to the operating results, and specifically Cable, I think Craig talked already about the fact that we have seen some pressure on commodities in our Cable business specifically. And that has resulted in the Cable margins being under pressure and down on a year-over-year basis. But even with that, to have the ROS still growing by 10 basis points year-over-year is a great confirmation of the performance in the Interconnect business in an environment that is inflationary. There's no doubt about it. There are inflationary pressures, and I think our team has done just a phenomenal job to either drive that in pricing with customers or in redesigning of products or in somehow making sure that we don't suffer the impact on the interconnect side of some of those commodity price increases, which are very broad. It's harder to do that in the Cable business, as you know, having the followed the company for so many years, because of the intensity of the consumption of commodities into that Cable combined with the nature of the market where it is a more constrained market and where pricing power is not always so evident. We continue to be very disciplined in that space, and we will remain disciplined. And whenever there are opportunities for us to pass on the impact of these commodities, we will certainly do so in a very quick fashion. But at this stage, I think the overall operating results of the company are very strong. We have grown on a year-over-year. And as Craig said earlier, we have a good outlook for the continuation of that performance in 2018. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much for the details. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Jim. Operator : And our next question comes from William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can comment, Adam, on your own lead times today, also customer inventories and the influence of any component shortages you're seeing. Basically sort of an update on supply chain conditions, please. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, no, thank you very much, Will. I mean, there is obviously a lot written about component shortages and lead times and things like this, and I think most of that \u2013 those discussions revolve around passive components, things like capacitors and transistors and various chips and things like that. We have not seen in our company meaningful or broad-based changes in our lead times, and we have some businesses that are doing very, very well. And occasionally, when that happens, you'll see the odd lead time go slightly up. But I can just tell you we continue to satisfy truly the needs of our customers. We're not on allocations, nothing like that. I mean, our team has done a fabulous job of flexing. I mean, just look at that business which is typically the least flexible, which is the military business where sometimes it does take you time to build capacity. And our team was able to grow on a year-over-year basis by 18% organically; just a very, very strong performance in a business where sometimes it is not as easy to flex in that way. And so I think our customers really continue to see with us a great supporter of their needs in that time of growing demand. And accordingly, I wouldn't expect that customers are necessarily building up kind of safety inventory. Now, I'll caveat that to say that we don't have peer visibility into the warehouses of our customers, in particular OEM customers. We get a little bit of visibility to our distributors. But what we see with those customers or hear at least anecdotally, is not a real sort of structural buildup in their inventory, and part of that is because we have been able to really satisfy their demand with our operational flexibility. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Maybe one other if I can. Given the increase in rates that we've seen, I'm wondering if there's any change in the M&A environment or your pipeline? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yes. I think we always, as you know, take a very long view in M&A. Whether markets are up or markets are down or rates are up or rates are down, that has not changed our strategic approach to M&A, whereby we cultivate a pipeline of companies, a very big pipeline of companies over a long time period where we remain poised when companies that we didn't know pop up in an instance. And we continue to have very strong pipeline of acquisitions. Yes, it's true. We didn't announce any new acquisitions this quarter, albeit having closed one early in the quarter that we talked about three months ago. But we continue to have a very strong pipeline of acquisitions, and I think the company, Amphenol, remains just a wonderful destination for companies large and small who are considering one day having a change in their ownership. And I think the credibility of our track record, the hospitableness of the organizational structure that we have, whereby new companies can join Amphenol without that significant disruption that is sometimes accompanied with an acquisition, together with our willingness to pay fair prices for great companies. And again, whatever the rate environment is or the market environment, market multiples, we look at this with a very, very long-term view towards M&A. And we're willing to pay reasonable and fair prices for very strong companies. And that discipline that we have had for many years has never resulted in us failing to have a strong acquisition program. And we don't think that that'll be the case, regardless of which way rates are headed. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. I was just curious. Obviously, your sales guidance calls for reasonable deceleration in organic sales growth. Some of the markets you participate in are cyclical. I guess I'm trying to gauge your confidence that we have sort of a soft landing in markets like auto, industrial maybe even commercial air versus prior cycles. Why do you think that could be the case outside of obviously your own content wins? Thanks. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. No. I mean I don't know soft landing, I think it's a strong sales guidance. We've increased our organic guide for the year. As you know, we came into the year with a guide of 2% to 4% and now we've increased that to 4% to 6% organically. And yes while we grew in this quarter on an organic basis by 12% that would mathematically imply that there is a little bit less growth in subsequent quarters. We should also recognize that mobile devices in this quarter grew 68% a very, very strong performance. We don't expect that same year-over-year performance, especially as we get into the back half of the year where last year Q4 we also grew something like 67% in mobile devices. But regardless of that we still think that this year will be a strong year for mobile devices in its totality. So I don't think if you were to take out for example that impact of the mobile devices which as you know has its certain volatility relative to what quarters are strong and what quarters are not strong, I think that you'd see a relatively balanced year; that is inherently implied in our outlook. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : That's helpful; and then just a quick follow-up. Can you guys give us a sense for your capital spending expectations for the full year roughly, maybe as a percent of the sales or dollars whatever you're comfortable with? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I mean as you know, our typical capital spending for the company is somewhere in the range of 2% to 4% that we talk about historically and we've been kind of averaging around that 3% level. I think this year based on program ramps, there could be some slight increase over the 3% level. But I would still expect to be in the range of the 2% to 4% give or take this year, so really no significant change versus over the last 2 years and certainly no difference in terms of trends going forward. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: So I think as Craig said I mean we may see maybe here in the second quarter and a little bit in the third quarter a little bit higher than normal but not over the course of the year. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Right. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. A couple questions... R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Good afternoon, Deepa. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : A couple questions on outlook, specifically in automotive. Could you talk about some of the regional performances that either came in better or worse than your expectation coming into the year and what they could mean for outlook? And also I'm looking for any confirmation that your underlying organic growth in automotive and industrial is still high-single-digits. You report it as mid-to high teens. Just if you can compare and contrast how the quarter progressed across regions, what that means for outlook, that'll be helpful. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah, sure. Well, just simple answer on your final part of the question, the organic growth outlook, we still think that is in the high single-digits, very robust outlook for the year on both auto and industrial. And then we have the benefits of some of the acquisitions that we've talked pretty extensively about. Relative to the auto outlook and the performance on a regional basis I think I talked about the fact that we're very pleased in the first quarter that we had double-digit growth really in all regions and strong double-digit growth I would say in all those regions. And I think that's just a testament to our team's great work in diversifying the business from a geographical perspective in addition to customer, in addition to application and product. And that is a big change for the company. If you look over the last half decade or so, we were predominantly a European automotive player. And today, it's a much, much more balanced position. Now, I wish I could tell you that we were sophisticated enough to have detailed and scientific guidance per region in our automotive business, and then, I'd be able to tell you that we do better or worse in each region, but we're maybe not that sophisticated. I think that we had strong performance in the quarter in all the regions. I don't think we were terribly surprised by one or another given region, or there's anything really special to report from one of the regions. I think our growth was fastest in Asia, and that was followed by Europe and then North America. I think that hasn't been a new trend necessarily. Of course, we had the acquisition of Sunpool at the end of the fourth quarter, which supported our Asian growth, but we had also good organic growth in Asia. So, I don't think regionally, we have any change to our outlook. We continue to feel very good about the company's broad position really around the world. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I do have two, if I could. First on broadband, understood the slightly better view for this year. Can you talk about what geographic region or regions may be driving that? And if any of that is potentially price increases? I think some of your competitors have talked about trying to put in place because of rising copper prices. And are you seeing higher prices maybe start to take hold? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think the broadband growth \u2013 again, it's modestly better performance and I guess, I would say, that's more related to North America than other regions. Well, look, we're waiting for the price increase dynamic to change, and we're looking very much forward to that. I've said it before many times. We won't let the sun set on an opportunity to raise prices when the material prices have gone up like they have in broadband. I can't tell you that our outlook \u2013 the change in our outlook is related yet to pricing. That, we have not yet seen. But, we're hopeful apparently like you are that that could happen. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then, a follow-up on mobile networks, which I know came in a little bit better. Any regional drivers on a geographic basis that caused this somewhat better mobile networks outlook? And appreciate the comments about not seeing any real benefit yet from 5G, but given all the engagement Amphenol has with different customers, do you have any view of when 5G may become a more material driver to your mobile networks business? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks very much, Mark. I think regionally, our performance in mobile networks was strongest in the quarter in North America. I think if I survey where we participate, that's probably the region where we've seen a little bit more momentum than we had anticipated coming into the year, and where we will continue to see that through the last three quarters of the year. Relative to 5G, it's very true. We have very close relationships with our customers, both OEMs and service providers. And we're working very broadly on a wide array of next-generation technologies, both interconnect and antennas, that will be incorporated into next-generation systems. All that being said, I cannot tell you when those real scale investments will be. Like everybody, I have read all the reports and heard some of them even firsthand about initial build-outs being done in certain places or targets of doing certain build-outs associated with certain events, like the Olympics and other things like that. But, in terms of when the real build-out will come and when you will see a true change in the spending associated with that build-out or a transition from current generation to next generation and the broad spending patterns of our customers, that, we don't have a good visibility on yet. But what we will be regardless is poised to take advantage of it when it comes. And I think there are always with \u2013 in the mobile networks market, just aspects of that that are hard to predict. There are combinations of companies that come. There's continued innovation that has to happen. You have to have also the innovation that happens on the devices that ultimately connect to the network. You have the availability of capital. You have capital markets. All those things ultimately go into the calculus of our customers whether they're going to ultimately drive a different level of spending and in adoption of those new networks. And we'll be ready whenever that does happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi guys. Good afternoon. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Hi, Joe. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Craig, just had a quick clarification for you. With your free cash flow guide for the year, slightly better than conversion than \u2013 well, to approximate net income or slightly better than net income, is that adjusting for the pension payment this quarter or is that inclusive of that spend? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I was actually \u2013 well specifically I was talking about operating cash flow but... Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: ... anyway certainly free cash flow is certainly we were talking. When we talk about our targets, we do talk about operating cash flow exceeding kind of net income and historically we've done usually even a little bit better than that, but that is \u2013 I think you have to really put in this one-time kind of voluntary contribution of the $80 million and then certainly that will have some impact on the operating cash flow for the year, but certainly from a payback perspective, from a return on investment perspective, that just made all the sense in the world. We've got a nice tax deduction under the current regime that we won't get under the new regime, and also certainly it reduces the cost of the plan quite significantly over a period of time, but anyways, to answer your question, yeah, you really probably would have to consider the payment that we made to the pension. Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And then on commercial aero, I think you guys said sales up like 9% organically, 14% in U.S. dollars and expecting low-single-digits for the full year, is that correct? And if so, like what's kind of driving that change from here? Is it comp? The comps looked okay when I look back to last year. So just some color there would be helpful. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, I mean if you mean the change from the performance in Q1 to a little bit less of an outlook for the full year, I think this is just the normal cadence that we see. Sometimes, it depends on the comparisons. I think we had probably a little bit of a more favorable comparison in Q1 of this year than we had in last year in some of the other quarters and so I wouldn't read anything more into that than maybe it has to do with the compares from last year. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just had a quick follow-up. Craig, on the cash flow conversion, even if I adjust for the pension payment, I think I get cash flow conversion at 80% in the March quarter. That's well below the 100% average you guys have had for five years. So, would you call out something specific that impacted cash flow conversion, again, adjusting for pension plan in March? And how does that true-up as you go out? Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Amit. Appreciate the question. Yeah. I mean I think that certainly, the cash flow \u2013 we generated a lot of cash flow and then I think this really \u2013 one quarter can vary from another quarter. We saw this in the third quarter of last year where we had a little bit lower cash flow because of the dynamics of the quarter in terms of when revenue was ramping into the fourth quarter. And then obviously, we had a very strong fourth quarter that was a little bit back-end weighted as fourth quarters normally are. So certainly, that did have some impact on the first quarter cash flow in addition to the fact that, but working capital needs coming into the second quarter which we are expecting some increase into the second quarter. So our working capital from a kind of cash collection cycle perspective wasn't significantly different than kind of what our normal kind of range would be. It certainly was a little bit higher, and the first quarter sometimes could be a little bit softer. So I wouldn't necessarily note anything specific other than working capital needs in the first quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I do expect the full year to kind of be typically strong where we would be over that 100% mark again, taking into account the pension payment that I just talked about before. So, nothing specific other than again quarters can vary from one to another. And sometimes we have very strong quarters and another times, for different reasons, usually working capital needs ramps when we have a little bit softer, but nothing from a longer-term perspective, that I would note. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you very much, Amit. Sorry that you had gotten cut-off before. Operator : We show no further questions at this time. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Great. Well, listen, and thank you all very much. We truly appreciate all of your interest in the company and we wish that you have a very nice spring. It's rainy here in Wallingford. Hopefully, where you are, the sun is shining and we look forward to talking to all of you here in about 90 days. Thanks again. Bye-bye. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice a day.",

LLC Operator : Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session, until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the Company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Our second quarter 2018 results were released this morning, I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take some questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $1.981 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.91 and $0.90, respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $86 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.05. Sales were up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the second quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisition and currency, sales in the second quarter increased 13%. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, and 7% in local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments; our Cable business, which comprised 6% of our sales, was up 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprised 94% of our sales, was up 20% in U.S. dollars from last year driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $408 million in the second quarter and operating margin was a record 20.6% in the second quarter of 2018, up 20 basis points compared to the adjusted operating margin in Q2 of 2017 of 20.4%, and up 40 basis points compared to the Q1 of 2018 of 20.2%. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable segment, margins were 13.2%, which is down compared to the second quarter of 2017 at 14.9%, primarily driven by an increase in certain commodity costs. In the Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.4% in the second quarter of 2018, which is up compared to the second quarter of last year at 22.3%. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Due to careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $26 million compared to $23 million last year, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates as well as the higher average debt levels primarily resulting from the company's stock buyback program. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the second quarter of 2018, compared to 26.5% in the second quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018, including the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises, was approximately 24.7% compared to 20.1% in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the second quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 14% in the second quarter of 2018 to $0.91 from $0.80 in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods, as well as certain acquisition related costs in the 2017 quarter grew 22% to a record $0.90 in the second quarter of 2018 from $0.74 in the second quarter of last year. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.025 billion, an 18% increase over the second quarter of 2017, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash; cash flow from operations was $265 million in the second quarter, or approximately 92% of net income which was strong and particular given the higher than normal tax related payments resulting from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of approximately $50 million, and including the first installment of the transition tax charge and the [indiscernible] taxes and other taxes paid under repatriation of cash during the quarter. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.6 billion and $903 million respectively at the end of June. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, excluding the impact of acquisitions were 78, 73 and 61 days respectively, which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $265 million along with the borrowings of $179 million under the commercial paper program, stock option proceeds of $30 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $33 million net of translation were used primarily to purchase approximately $263 million of the company's stock, to fund acquisitions of $59 million, to fund dividend payments of $57 million, and to fund net capital expenditures of $78 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of stock at an average price of approximately $86 under the new $2 billion three year open market stock repurchase plan. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which was held outside of the U.S. At June 30, 2018 the company had issued approximately $1 billion under it's U.S. commercial paper program, and the company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $1.9 billion. The total debt at June 30th of 2018 was approximately $3.4 billion and net debt was approximately $2.4 billion. Second quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $482 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. And I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig and like to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter, and then I'll get into a discussion on our progress across our diversified server markets. Then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and the full year, and of course we'll have some time for questions at the end. Craig just detailed the company had a very strong second quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by very strong 19% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically reaching a new record for the company of $1.981 billion. And then for the third quarter in a row we booked another record level of orders of $2.025 billion and that represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.02:1. Operating margin in the quarter reached a new record 20.6% and just yet another demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance. Then finally, as Craig said, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.90 in the quarter and that grew a strong 22% from prior year. With these results I can just say that I'm very proud of our entire global Amphenol organization, and in a time like this you just see the agility and the superior execution that are clearly reflected in the company's strong results in the second quarter and indeed in the whole first half of 2018. We're very pleased in the quarter to announce two new and small acquisitions that we completed late in June, All Sensors is a California based provider of high technology pressure sensors for the industrial market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. All Sensors represent another excellent expansion of our already strong and growing sensor offering for a variety of segments within the industrial market including, in particular, medical applications. Ardent Concepts is the New Hampshire based manufacturer of high-speed socket interconnect products for advanced processers, and with sales of approximately $10 million on an annual basis. Ardent enhances our already industry-leading high-speed connector offering, in particular for the communications and the test and measurement markets. As we welcome these great new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create excellent value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then successfully bring those companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our trends and the progress across our various served markets; I just want to comment that as we finish the second quarter we remain very pleased with the breadth and the balance across our end markets. Once again in the second quarter, no market represented more than 21% of our sales in the quarter, and this balance is the true for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And particularly, this quarter we're very pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our markets here in the second quarter. Turning first to the military market; this market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter, had a very good quarter in military. Sales increased from prior year by better than expected and very strong 23% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically as we once again drove growth across virtually every segment of the military market. Our performance in the quarter was led in particular by strength in rotorcraft vehicle, avionics and airframe, communications as well as ordinance related applications. Sequentially our sales came in stronger than we had expected rising 5% from the first quarter. And as we look ahead, we now expect sales in the third quarter to remain at these robust levels and for the full year 2018 we now expect to achieve mid-teens growth in the military market, a very strong outlook. Our team working in the all-important military market continues to do just an outstanding job of expanding our position in this market. Our success is a reflection of the continued drive to develop leading edge high-technology interconnect solutions which are then incorporated into a broad array of military electronics. And as militaries around the world bolster their spending, in particular, their spending on next-generation solutions our outstanding performance has positioned us to continue to drive strong results into the long-term. The commercial air market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and our performance strengthened once again here in the second quarter with sales increasing by 17% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically. Sequentially our sales grew slightly from the first quarter, and as we look into the third quarter, while we expect a normal seasonal moderation in sales -- for the full year 2018 we now expect to achieve a low double-digit increase compared to prior year. We're encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market in the first half of 2018 and we remain confident in the company's overall position in the global commercial aviation market. We continue to broaden our range of products and support of the revolution of new electronics in next-generation planes, and we look forward to capitalize on these leading technologies for many years to come. The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. As we again drove organic growth across essentially all segments of the industrial market and this included hybrid bus and truck, railway mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, oil and gas, alternative energy, as well as instrumentation. And in addition, we're pleased to have realized continued benefits from our acquisitions that we've completed over the course of the last year. Sequentially, sales were up strongly rising by 14% from the first quarter. As we look into the third quarter, though we expect sales to moderate from these current levels due to traditional summer seasonality, nevertheless for the full year 2018 we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth in the industrial market. Our team is just really pleased with the continued strong performance in the industrial market. Whether through our organic product development efforts or our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. And as electronics continues to transform the industrial market we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important space into the future. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and we're going to have strong performance in this market with sales growing 22% in U.S. dollars, 16% in local currency and 10% organically. Sequentially sales growth is expected by 2% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. But looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain approximately at these levels despite the summer seasonality and for the full year 2018 we continue to expect sales growth in the high-teens which includes the benefit of acquisitions. We remain excited by the company's outstanding position in the global automotive market, our team around the world continues to expand our range of high technology interconnect products sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicle. These developments together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies has positioned us strongly for the future as car makers continue to integrate advanced electronics into fuel powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. In addition, our team is accelerating their work with customers on new advanced technologies and that includes in particular, areas such as autonomous semi-autonomous driving. All of this creates an outstanding long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and our sales performance is a bit stronger than we had expected in the second quarter as volumes of certain existing programs were higher than we had thought coming into the quarter. Sales rose by 27% from prior year as higher sales of products incorporated into smartphone and accessories were only partially offset by somewhat lower sales related to tablets and laptops. As we expected coming into the quarter, sales decreased from the first quarter declining by about 15% sequentially. We expect sales in the third quarter to increase significantly from these levels as we begin to ramp up on a variety of new programs. And given our strengthening position on several of these new programs that are currently going to mass production, and of course, as always understanding the mobile devices market is inherently very difficult to predict we now expect sales in the mobile devices market to increase in the mid to high teens for the full year 2018, a very strong performance. Our results here in the second quarter together with the strengthened outlook continues to demonstrate the extraordinary abilities of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers all while continuing to focus on development of innovative next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market, and we look forward to continuing to realizing the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we're pleased that our sales grew strongly in the quarter rising a better than expected 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically from the prior year. Our growth this quarter was driven in particular by sales of our high-technology antenna and interconnect products sold direct to service providers; sequentially our sales grew 14% from the first quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a reduction in sales from these levels, however, for the full year 2018 we now expect a mid-single digit sales increase from prior year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, while we're encouraged by our stronger performance as well as our strengthened outlook we did not yet see meaningful changes in the overall outlook for carrier spending; and in particular, we don't believe that spending on 5G systems in 2018 will be all that significant. Regardless our team has continued to work hard to position us extremely well for the future, and so when that next wave of infrastructure spending does materialize we're confident that we'll ultimately participate broadly with our wide array of antenna and interconnect products, both working with global equipment manufacturers as well as the service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and in this market as well our performance was stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter. Our sales grew compared to last year by 13% in U.S. dollar and 9% organically, and that was driven in particular by growth in storage and server applications. Sequentially our sales grew by a very robust 15% from the first quarter with growth in virtually all segments of the IT market. As we look towards the third quarter we expect our sales to remain at these robust levels and for the full year we now expect to realize sales growth in the high single digits which is a fair bit better than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT Datacom market is as strong as ever. As we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber optics for a broad range of OEMs and web service providers around the world as customers continue to accelerate datacenter performance in order to manage the explosive growth of online traffic. We remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. Then finally the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were down by about 5% from prior years as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis though sales rose by bit less than expected 11% from the first quarter. For the third quarter we expect a modest increase in sales from these levels, and for the full year 2018 we now expect our sales in the broadband market to be roughly at the same level as prior year. Despite our more muted outlook for the broadband market this year we're still confident in the strength of our position, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering and support of customers around the world who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses. So just in summary, I just can only say that we're extremely pleased with the company's strong second quarter and successful first half of 2018 as the entire Amphenol organization has continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across a broad and diverse array of markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and highly flexible cost structure, and extremely effective acquisition program, and an agile entrepreneurial management team. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year; while the overall demand environment is strong there are still uncertainties, and in particular related to trade and geopolitics. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the third quarter we anticipate sales in the range of $1.980 billion to do $2.20 billion, as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.91 to $0.93; this represents the sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 8% to 10% and 10% to 12% respectively. For the full year 2018 we expect sales in the range of $7.820 billion to $7.9 billion, as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.57 to $3.61. For the full year this new guidance represents now sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 13% and 14% to 16% respectively over 2017. And in particular, this new outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of 8% to 9%, and this is significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 4% to 6%, as well as our original organic growth guidance coming into the year of 2% to 4%. But we're very encouraged by the company's strong second quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook, and I can just tell you that I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great results in the second quarter and the first half by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position while also delivering strong financial performance in the second half of 2018 and beyond. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Certainly. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : First question on tariffs; so Adam you alluded to it a bit in your thoughts about your outlook. Can you help us better understand how the conversations are going with your customers and any shifts you're thinking about there? And more specifically, for Amphenol given how many sites that Amphenol has in China; can you help us understand how much of your shipments may be from plants in China into the U.S. and is there any reallocation of your manufacturing that you're contemplating doing? Adam Norwitt : I mean obviously this has been a big news story here. I think we talked about this last quarter also quite extensively, and one thing I'm just so pleased with our team -- like many things that come along over which one has no control, I mean our team around the world looks at this and says it is what it is, we're going to lean into it and really proactively deal with the situation. And I'm just so pleased when we look at our outlook and we look at the very minimal impact that these tariffs so far have on our outlook for the business, and that's just a result of the agility of the Amphenol management team to react in the face of a changing environment. Now what does that mean in particular? I think you alluded to the fact of conversations and one of those conversations -- you can imagine that we've been extremely communicative with our customers throughout this whole process and we continue to be so. I mean this is a situation where one has to just be extremely transparent and over communicating in order to make sure that you're supporting customers the best way you can while at the same time understanding that sometimes those costs have to be passed through to your partners whether those be distributors or customers, and our first reaction to the tariffs in the first steps that we take upon those tariffs really being even threatened is to look at what we can do to mitigate the impact of those tariffs and thereby not cause harm to our customers. And I think our team around the world has just done a fantastic job of quickly pivoting towards whatever needs to be done and that -- whatever needs to be done can be a whole host of things; I mean you can imagine with the number of products we sell to the number of different customers and the number of different markets from the number of different facilities that there is a long, long list of different tactics and approaches that one takes to mitigate those tariffs and I don't need to go into all of the details of those but just let it be said that the team is doing a fabulous job of mitigating. And then to the extent that we're not able to mitigate that -- well, certainly then that gets passed on and worked with customers to ensure that we're minimizing whatever has to be passed on but passing on what has to be passed on through pricing, surcharges and other things. And again, there is not a one-size approach that we're taking to this, it's very much tailor-made to the circumstances of the various products and our team is just doing a fabulous job of dealing with that. Now relative to our position in China -- you know, do we import certain things from China that are impacted by tariffs; of course we do like any other company and in our position. But the other thing that I will say is, you know very well our approach to manufacturing regardless of where it is has always been an approach that emphasizes flexibility and localization. And so we are always making sure that the best that we can, we're going to make the products in the region where we sell it and we're going to make those in facilities that are flexible such that if we need to change something we can change that something in a reasonable time period. And so that's true, we have a strong position in China but it doesn't mean that we're locked into anything and we continue to support our customers around the world very well in those local markets. Look, I will just say this which is we're big believers in free trade and we believe that ultimately free trade is a positive for all industries let alone the electronics industry which is one of the most global industries and we are a reflection of that global electronics industry as a global company as we are, and we're certainly hopeful in lending our voice to the process very aggressively to make sure that these tariffs are not a long lived experiment here but whatever it is it is and we will make sure that we deal with that effectively and we have done so far. Mark Delaney : Follow-up question on SG&A which -- the nice SG&A -- leverage I think contributed to the record EBIT margin; so I'm just curious how we should think about SG&A as you move through the year and to what extent some of this leverage can be sustained? Thank you. Craig Lampo : In regards to just SG&A and just overall profitability the companies are -- certainly we're very happy and excited with the results we had in the quarter generating a 20.6% record operating margins in the quarter. As you know, we don't look at operating margin -- we don't look at our profitability specifically from a gross margin or SG&A's perspective, we really measure ourselves -- measure operations on an operating margin perspective, and certainly whatever our operations have to do ultimately to reach those high performance bars that we set for them, they do regardless of what levers they need to pull within their businesses. You can also imagine that every business doesn't have the same structure in regards to SG&A and gross margin and certain of our operations have higher SG&A levels because that's what they need to run their business and certain of having lower SG&A levels depending on the gross margins that they may have within that business. So I think -- again, we're very happy with the conversion that we had into the second quarter, the SG&A levels that we have is kind of -- actually I would say is a more typical sequential kind of growth in our SG&A if you kind of look at the growth rate versus kind of our sales rate going into the second quarter, so I would say that actually there is not so much I would point out from an unusual aspect with regards to that but we generally view our operating margins ultimately at the end of the day and we're very happy with that performance, and nothing specific to point out in SG&A from that perspective. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Craig, could you just walk through the free cash flow dynamics of -- I think the conversion rate has been under 50% for the first half of the year, I think there is some one-time tax payments there. Just some puts and takes there and then as you get into the back half should we expect this conversion to improve back to the high 90% that you traditionally have done? Craig Lampo : As you know, we've talked about this in the past and certainly our goal is to drive our annual operating cash flow at a level that's higher than our net income and we have achieved this over many years and we do expect to continue to achieve that. And as I did mention in my prepared remarks, the company did make about $50 million in tax related payments during the quarter and this related to the tax reform that -- it was recently occurred, excluding these payments our operating cash flow in the quarter was actually above our targeted income levels -- our net income levels of over 100%, it was well above that actually. So we do I would say expect in the full year to have that typically strong operating cash flow of over our targeted levels and taking into account these non-recurring pension contribution that we had in the first quarter of around $80 million in addition to the higher level of foreign withholding and other taxes we have paid as it relates to the repatriations during the year that are hired I would say in the first half, then we would expect in the future just because of the -- some of the cash that was overseas that now we're bringing back in a more accelerated fashion. So, I would say we're very pleased actually with ultimately our operating cash flow performance in the first half considering the working capital needed to support these higher growth rates that certainly we're achieving; and -- I would also mention though when it comes kind of -- past the operating cash flow and we talk about free cash flow that we did talk about this a little bit last quarter and we do expect to have -- and we have had a little bit higher level of capital expenditures during the quarter, again as we mentioned, and we do expect to have this at a little bit higher level during the year. But again, within our range we typically talk about the 2% to 4% range of capital spending in this year and certainly in the quarter we're a little bit higher -- kind of at the top end of that range, maybe very slightly above. So that essentially I think if you look at our free cash flow it's probably one of the areas that had a slight impact. I think that as -- again, we usually don't talk about 2019 and beyond but I wouldn't expect that we would continue to be at that that much of higher level, we continue to kind of be -- maybe the more middle of our normal typical range show though we've been in the past and therefore I would believe that our free cash flow in the future would be typically strong. But I have to say that, this higher level of capital expenditures to support these -- really strong programs that we've won is really -- I think a testament of the strength of the company and the fact that we're able to support that and drive the strong growth that we're seeing. Amit Daryanani : And then I guess if I could just follow-up the industrial segment; you've -- it had some really good growth for the last several quarters and I think 2018 you talked about mid-teens organic growth. If you step back and think that -- what seems to be driving this; is that an uptick in industrial spend or is it more content games and market share pickup that you guys have? And do you see the sustained growth levels you have had in '19 in longer term or was there something unique in '18 that's driving the mid-teens growth here? Adam Norwitt : Well, I mean I don't know about 2019 so I'm not going to comment necessarily on 2019 but I can tell you that we're just -- the growth this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is very broad based. And so if one tries to sort of say what is going on across the industrial market, I think there is two things. Clearly, there is a good macro environment overall, and I think that good macro environment overall tends to have a positive impact on industrial. But layered on to that is a trend that is not a new trend but it may be somewhat of an accelerating trend, and that is the adoption of electronics into the industrial space. Whether that is in trains, whether that is in factory automation equipment, whether that is in heavy trucks, in new battery technology, in medical areas; you name it across all of those areas where we participate, so broadly, we continue to see customers just adopting new electronics at an increasing pace and increasing rate of change. And I think the reason is, is -- industrial is usually slow, it is the last to tend to adopt those kind of new things because you're putting complex electronics into very harsh environments; you think about an oil and gas drilling environment, you think about a high speed train, I mean these are not hospitable environment for delicate and advanced electronics but I think that the ability to package those electronics has gotten so much stronger, our ability and capability to enable the packaging of those electronic functions with our high performance products is really part of that whole drive and I think that is across all these markets the real trend that we have seen here. Now, is that trend going to continue in the future? I would be very surprised if it doesn't because you're just solving a lot of problems when you think about what these electronics are doing, whether that is targeted irrigation, whether that's the tracking of trucks and all the electronics that goes along with that, I mean it's very, very high precision functionalities being put on to equipment that is traditionally thought of as pretty heavy to lug around. It's just -- it's creating a lot of value for the end customers. But as you know, if there is in 2019 a different macro dynamic or anything else industrial is obviously not immune to that but we look forward for the long-term to continuing to participate in this broad adoption of electronics in the industrial market. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, in mobile devices we clearly see enough history I guess of volatility and -- you significantly increased your outlook here for the year. Can you give us some sense of what change in the last 90 days -- you know, design wins that have firmed up as a market share clarity on allocation or do you actually see a broader market improvement? And can you give us some sense of how that strength layers in across the back half? Adam Norwitt : Well, we talked about it last quarter when we also saw a bit of a strengthening environment. I would just say that as you get closer to the second half which is when all the action is in the mobile devices market, you start to get a little bit more clarity into all those things that you described whether that is the strength of your design-ins, the shares you've been allocated or the volume that the customers are expecting, and so I would guess -- I guess the best way to put it is all of those we've seen a little bit more of a favorable perspective on and thus has given us the confidence to have a relatively meaningful increase in our outlook here in mobile devices. Now in terms of the overlay in the second half and I guess you're asking about what the cadence would be between Q3 and Q4; I mean we see a significant increase here in the third quarter as I talked about in my guidance, I don't -- what is it ultimately going to be between Q3 and Q4, there is always a little bit of dynamic to that, it remains a very hard market to predict even within a month or two, let alone across 90 days but I think we would see that we'd have a significant increase here in the third quarter and then we see in the fourth quarter still some increase but maybe not quite as significant on a sequential basis as we see from the second quarter, third quarter. Obviously, second half to first half as usual is going to be very strong -- I wouldn't say that we're going to have necessarily this year quite as magnified of a second half, at least based on our current view of the market as we had last year; you will recall, last year we had the second half that was close to double what it was in the first half, and so I think that -- we wouldn't expect it to be such a magnified growth in the first half. And we saw as I mentioned my prepared remarks a little bit stronger performance even in the second quarter on some of the existing programs that we're working on. And again, that takes away from the percentage growth that you'd see in the second half. Wamsi Mohan : And then, are you seeing any impact that your customers given shortages of some components like MLCC [ph] capacitors, I mean whoever heard of some of the MS players start to call out revenue misses because they just don't have enough component availability. Is that becoming a more acute problem relative to last quarter? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, we had very strong growth here and very strong results even amidst these very widely reported and real problems that people are facing with access to certain components, and we mentioned MLCC, that's obviously the one that's probably the most talked about but there seems to be a demand on a lot of different components that are out there. Has it had a material impact or meaningful impact on our ability or the demand of our customers to -- for our product, nothing meaningful, have there been anecdotes that we've seen, have we had people that have had to chase things because even we use once in a while some of these things in certain advanced products. I mean no question, I guess we probably had more people chasing things than we had a year ago but it has not had any meaningful impact on either our ability to ship or our customer's desire for our products, at least so far. I mean it's a situation that is very broad in the industry but we do see a lot of customers being very sophisticated about how they're dealing with this and I think it's something that hopefully the industry is going to work their way through. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Shawn Harrison : Adam, I'm probably going to date myself but thinking back over the past -- I don't know, almost 15 years of covering you guys, I don't think I've seen as many kind of drop in orders and upside to kind of current quarter, sales trends as we've seen over the past three to four quarters. And I'm wondering maybe what's your perspective on why that's occurring? We know the macro is strong but are some of your competitors having problems with lead times or there are other factors at work where you're consistently seeing upside in current quarter results? Adam Norwitt : Yes, 15 years is a long time, I'm actually 20 years with the company today Shawn, so we're both dating each other here. Look, I think we've had really strong performance, it's a positive macro environment as we said but I think also the momentum that we've developed with the breadth of our technologies across such a diverse array of market has really put us in a strong position and that strong position ultimately gives us a great shot of winning with those customers who really need our advanced technologies and so I would say that when you look at our performance on any comparative basis I would say that we're probably winning a little bit more than our fair share. And because of that strength of the technology, the reactivity, I mean -- Wamsi just asked about shortages and the ability of customers to deal with that, I mean you can bet that our team with their typical Amphenolian reactivity is out there responding to customers when customers are a little bit more stressed about the availability of things than they have been in the past. And so if we can quickly step in and say yes, we can get that for you, we can we can ramp up capacity, we can shift things when necessary -- that at least has a positive image to the company whether that means we're taking particularly business from competitors who can't ship; I wouldn't necessarily point to any specifics about that but I just think the overall offering that we have to customers of high technology products available to them at the right quality at the right cost; we're doing a good job, the team overall, and that's allowed us to capitalize on some of this upside. Shawn Harrison : As a follow-up if I may, just the mobile information business maybe geographically where was the upside this quarter? And then on the 5G dynamic, if we listen to Ericsson from last week, they seemed a little bit more bullish on the 5G market than maybe you are and so wondering if -- where the disconnect may lie? Adam Norwitt : Geographically I would say that in mobile networks -- I mean we had decent growth broadly but I will say it was probably more of a North America focused growth quarter for us in mobile networks in the second quarter. Look, Ericsson's got to know a lot more than we are. I mean we're the tail being waged by the dog here, but that being said, we have a very broad position and our discussions with customers -- what we see right now -- not that we don't see anything from 5G but I think what I said is we don't see that as being significant or really very meaningful this year, is there a lot of work going on in 5G, no doubt about it, a lot of work and is there a lot of systems that customers are designing to be 5G ready; I think we see that as well. But ultimately when we think about the magnitude of a next-generation mobile networks infrastructure build and you know that Shawn better than I do; those can be quite meaningful and it gets launched and there is a big build out that happened. And we don't expect to see those kind of big build outs of 5G this year, there is test sites being built, there is networks that are starting to be flushed out, there is discussions around where that's going to happen first and what those functionalities are going to be but ultimately we don't see that as being significant to our results this year. Now all that being said, I have to say, I mean we come into -- we come out of the second quarter with certainly a more positive view of mobile networks this year than as we -- than it was when we entered the year. And so, I think that we're pleased with the performance, we're very pleased in particular in the second quarter, we grew double digits organically on a year-over-year basis and we're able to somewhat upgrade our outlook for the full year. So I think we feel really good about the position that we have there and we look forward into the long-term to see when the real substance of 5G -- the substance of those investments comes, we're confident we'll be positioned for it. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Steve Fox : First of all, Adam, you touched on a few of these points but I was just curious if you could address directly sort of some of the competitive outperformance; your organic growth is about 2X some of your larger competitors right now. So I was curious if there was two or three things you would highlight that maybe are leading to that? And then secondly, with regard to the tariffs we're hearing a lot about sort of prices going up in distribution as an offset to some of these tariffs but I was curious where the limit is on that and whether you have to manage that a little more delicately than maybe we're understanding? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : I mean look, I'm not going to speak to others in the industry which are all fine companies but I will speak to our organization. I think I mentioned before, I mean we believe one of the core reasons for our performance is really the agility of the organization to react regardless of the environment. I mean you flip it in a bad time what does that mean? It means reacting on the bottom-line, it means reacting to customers when they are really in -- sometimes very difficult times but in a good economy like we have today it can be just as critical to have that reactivity; the reactivity to get the product to the customer, the reactivity to make investments on behalf of the customers in a timely fashion, the reactivity to accelerate new product developments when people are so busy just making what they have in the current generation, I mean there is a lot that goes on there that ultimately our 110 or so general managers around the world this is the job that they are doing day-in and day-out. I mean they wake up in the morning, that's what they do; when they go -- when they leave the office and head home at night that's what they do. I mean it is just exactly that ability to react quickly in real-time to changing needs, that is one of the greatest assets of Amphenol. And then you couple that with the technology developments of the company, and I think over the last decade or so we've made just great strides in improving on the breadth and depth of our technology offering to customers. And when you look at the acceleration of what I call the electronics revolution in really every area that we work, there is a premium put on having a technology that is truly able to enable our customer systems to perform at these higher levels that ultimately consumers and businesses are demanding. And this is I guess you would say the better mousetrap approach here and I think our team has developed a lot of better mousetraps in terms of getting the right product to customers for the applications that that they need. Now as it relates to tariffs, I mean -- look, pricing and all of this is a very, very delicate thing and I mentioned earlier, we're not taking just a single omnibus approach to that but no question in the distribution channel -- there is a lot of discussion about that and a lot of transparency that we have with our distributors. What are -- as you say the limits of that? I mean there are some products where the limits are very low and there are other products where the limits are very different, it really depends on the nature of those products, where those products are traditionally procured from, whether those are movable or not, whether there are other mitigation measures that one can take on the tariffs. And ultimately what the market will bear, and I think by doing that not in a monolithic fashion but rather on a really -- almost part number by part number, customer by customer, application by application approach you're able to much more uniquely tailor each effort towards what the market will bear, what the customers can absorb and pass on themselves or what the nature of the product is and what you can do with that product to mitigate those tariffs. And I think that is a little bit the same as the answer to the first part of your question which is that ability to be uniquely flexible in each instance is something that helps us a lot in dealing with difficult thing. I mean these tariffs are difficult thing, I will tell you it's not without time spent, I mean our team has spent an enormous amount of time here and I would get up on a soapbox for a minute and say that -- talk about regulatory burden, I mean these tariffs are an enormous regulatory burden on business in general because of the time you spend to manage through them to make sure that your customers are not unduly punished by those measures. But I think our team is doing a really fabulous job in that light. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : Adam, I was hoping to get your thoughts from the perspective of the market being as strong as it is, we're clearly in a positive economic cycle and you guys guided five of your eight segments to be stronger for the year. I guess trying to parse that out is that upside coming from the strength that you're seeing in those markets in particular or do you feel that that upside is coming from Amphenol's ability to take some share, do a bit better in those markets? Adam Norwitt : Look, I think it depends is the answer and that's sort of the answer to many things that we always say at Amphenol, it really does depend. I think in some of those markets I would say that we are clearly outperforming even the strength, I mean you just take a look at something like the military market; I mean the military market -- we are expecting now kind of a mid-teens organic growth for the year, and that's just really really strong, I don't think that military budgets are increasing by that month but what I do think is that the adoption of electronics in the military market and our participation in that adoption of electronics is very strong. And so I guess you could say that yes you have a hospitable market but you also have been in the case of the military market at least, very strong performance specific to Amphenol. I mean I don't want to go through all five of those markets as you referred to but just let it be said that I think there is a combination across each of them of -- some macro strength in them, some that is more unique to us. Sherri Scribner : And then I guess digging into the mobile devices market; I know we've heard from a number of suppliers that they're seeing some benefits in that market from higher ASPs and more complex products. Do you think that some of the strength that you're seeing in the back half is being driven by that or is it more share gains or is it more unit growth? Adam Norwitt : Well, I think it's a combination of all of them. I mean there is no doubt about it as mobile devices advance and through their generations -- I mean one of two things can happen, either they can get really commoditized and it becomes just a host for some software or it becomes a more premium on the performance of the hardware, and I think we've said for many, many, many years that for us we're going to participate where there is a premium on the hardware and the corollary to that is we believe that ultimately to be successful our customers are going to have to design innovations into their products themselves, not just becoming kind of commoditized hosts for certain software. And I think we've seen that, I think we've seen in next-generation mobile devices more functionality in the hardware and trying to push all of that into smaller packages with higher performance, more signals that are going through them, higher bandwidth of singles; all of that can ultimately drive to more complexity and more technologies that can be embedded within the products. And to the extent that that happens, I think we've been consistent in saying again for many years that to the extent that that trend continues, we see the mobile device market as a good place to be and I think we're seeing that this year. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : Looks like the organic growth expectations within automotive continues to be high single digit. Is that correct? And just curious, you did low double digits in first half and as you look into your backlog within auto, is there any moderation expected in second half especially with Europe WOTP headwinds? Adam Norwitt : I think -- I mean what we've talked about is our overall outlook for the automotive market in the mid-teens. I think we didn't specifically say what our organic growth would be for the year but I think we don't expect it to be much different than it's been here in the second quarter; so we grew in the quarter by 10% organically, so very strong -- I guess 10% would qualify as low double digits, the lowest of double digits let me say. As we look into the second half for automotive, I don't know that we necessarily see much of a slowdown in the second half; I mean -- the only thing is that we had an acquisition at the end of last year in the fourth quarter, so the acquisition benefit maybe towards the very end of the year will be a little bit less but from an organic basis I would guess our automotive business be pretty consistent across the year. Deepa Raghavan : Share buybacks, that's been pretty strong in the first half, looks like you've taken the benefit of downdraft here but you had to borrow to do that obviously. So the question is, where are you with regards to cash repatriation? And as you continue to repatriate that should we expect the repatriated cash to juice share buybacks or will that be used to pay down debt mostly from here? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yes, I think in regards to the share buyback certainly there is a number of factors that we take into consideration; one being certainly the market price of the stock and then as well as other cash needs and the particular period that we're looking at that. And certainly we may purchase more or less shares in particular quarterly period, we have seen a little bit more share buybacks in the first half. As you mentioned we did do quite a significant amount of repatriation in the first half which has actually driven more of the buybacks that we've done, and addition to the fact that with the tax reform just becoming effective in the first quarter is when we really started to repatriate a majority of the cash. In regards to the buybacks, I wouldn't necessarily signal any significant change other than I wouldn't necessarily also expect the same level in the second half as we do it in the first half; it really depends again based on all the factors that I mentioned. In regards to repatriation, I would say that the first half will probably be higher than the second half by quite a bit. In regards to our repatriation activities, certainly we brought back a lot in the first half and the second half will be much less than that but what we will continue to repatriate where it makes sense from a foreign tax perspective and other considerations. And then going forward we'll -- from a repurchase activity we'll see what makes sense based on again the cash needs from an M&A perspective or from where we think the market price seems to be. So certainly it's something that we really don't make the decision on [indiscernible] advance, it's really more kind of on a quarter by quarter basis. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. William Stein : We've spoken a lot about tariffs and understanding the very dynamic nature of the company, we expect you've managed that as well as or probably better than anyone else. There is another sort of creeping trend that I'm hearing from industry contacts and I wondered if you could comment on it that relates to inflating commodity costs in particular resins, and I think you mentioned this briefly in the prepared remarks, but if you could give us any more details to your expectations for that trend to continue and you're -- in particular your ability to pass that on through the channel. My understanding is the channel taking those price increases but any comments -- sort of clarifications would be really helpful. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean I think what Craig talked about in his prepared remarks was really specific to our cable segment and we have continued to see on a year-over-year basis at least commodity costs have a more magnified impact on that business where materials is the bigger percent of the overall cost basis. I think that it's a little bit of a mixed bag, I mean this year has been very inflationary in it's totality, and I think on a year-over-year basis it's inflationary. Even if some of the commodities, in particular some of the precious metals have pulled back a little bit from their highs over the course of the last maybe -- 60, 90 days, maybe that balances a bit out with some of the dynamics that you talked about with respect to the plastics. I think look this is something that we just deal with all the time, and so whenever you get commodity price increases at least in our interconnect segment our team is doing everything that they can to mitigate that and to the extent they can't mitigate it then we work with customers to see whether there is reasonable ways to pass the impact of that on to our customers, and you can do that with varying degrees of success based on usually the market dynamics that those customers are facing. And so to the extent that plastics are a little bit up and to the extent that that's maybe balanced a little bit with metals, I mean we don't see right now a real significant impact any different than we have seen that quarter ago or two quarters ago. On a year-over-year basis it is a little bit inflationary environment but I think our -- I think that inflationary environment is also balanced to the end demand, you know that well Will because you've followed the company for a quite a while. What really matters to us is not necessarily whether commodities go up or commodities go down but do they go up and go down in balance with end demand. And I think we are in a relatively healthy demand environment so to the extent that there are commodity increases that allows our customers, that allows us to pass on ultimately the impact of those commodity increases, it's when there is a disconnect between them and we all saw that -- it was around seven years ago in 2011 where the demand environment was not very robust yet you had a very frothy commodities environment, primarily driven by financial speculation that ultimately created real pressure on margins in 2011. But if you look at our performance today, we're expanding margins on a year-over-year basis, we're really reaching the highest levels of profitability in our history and that comes amidst what is still a modestly inflationary environment but with a robust demand environment. So I think that if that's matching and the consistency between the two that really matters to us and right now we see that is pretty well aligned. William Stein : You had very good conversion on the operating line this quarter as you often do, I think it was over 25%. I think you're running above your long-term op margin target, you're doing another acquisition in the sensor category which we think is -- tends to be a long-term accretive to that. Should we anticipate a continued expansion on the operating margin line as we go forward? Adam Norwitt : Yes, we certainly -- again, we had a great quarter from a profitability perspective, we did deliver a little bit above of what our kind of long-term target is; I mean not significantly above but certainly a little bit above that. And if you look, we don't guide to specific margin numbers but if you kind of -- our implied guidance would if you actually -- looked at the numbers it would actually be pretty -- some margin expansion in the second half, so we do expect to have some more margin expansion. But again on a normal conversion basis, not anything step function or anything like that; so I think that there's nothing I guess unusual that I would point out from that, I think our longer term 25% conversion is still something that we think we can achieve, we're very happy with the results so far this year, we do see a little bit of pressure on the overall year related to some new acquisitions that aren't quite at the level of the average of the company ad in terms of adopting the Amphenol philosophy but we certainly are still committed to having them achieve them and certainly optimistic there in addition to some pressure as we mentioned before on the cable segment in regards to their margins in terms of commodity cost impact. But other than that we're really converting very well and sequentially, I think we'll continue to see that nice conversion towards the rest of the year here. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Jim Suva : One quick question for each of you and I'll ask them at the same time so you can take them in whatever order you prefer but a strategy question more for Adam; Adam you've made now several acquisitions in the sensor area or segment of the world starting with GE sensor and then subsequent to those others. Do you see the world of sensors and connectors merging overtime? Is that like a natural evolution? Do you read them as separate? And then Craig on the integration of the recent acquisitions; can you help us out or they kind of at operating profitability that you're pleased at? Does Amphenol bring in a lot of tools or best-in-class situation or how should we think about the folding in of those from a financial perspective? Adam Norwitt : Maybe I'll take your strategy question first here. I mean you're correct in saying that we've now acquired quite a number of sensor and sensor-related businesses since the time we made our first sensor acquisition which is now more than four and a half years ago when we first acquired the advanced sensor business from GE. And I just tell you that we were just so pleased with the progress that we've made both organically, as well as through those ongoing acquisitions in that the most recent which is this small company All Sensors that we acquired this quarter. To your question is the sensor and the connector world just going to merge together? I mean that I don't know. Are we seeing within our company a great value of having that total offering of interconnect together with sensors, I mean we certainly are. I think the presence that we have across a diverse array of markets into really every nook and cranny of the electronics industry that's just a fabulous advantage for the sensor companies. Our ability to work with customers to package those sensor solutions and ultimately which need an interconnect. Sometimes quite significant interconnect content within them that has proven to be a great offering to customers and we've seen quite a lot of progress there with customers who really like the idea of having one product to choke with that consolidated offering. And I think that the technology trends of the two types of product sensors and connectors; I mean they are really one and the same, I mean you take something like the Internet of Things where you have this just extraordinary explosion of connected devices and what ties those devices so many times together is the fact that they've got to have in addition to some integrated circuit which we're not going to be participating in of course, they got to have a sensor, a connector, and an antenna and when we think of the total range of interconnect products we include in that sensors, connectors, antennas and that creates a great proposition for customers who are dealing with unique and challenging design issues that we can many times help them to resolve. So I think our strategy is certainly that that is a great offering, whether the industry and whether every company who is in sensors is going to be in connectors and vice versa, I think that I wouldn't go so far as to say. I mean there is plenty of room in the industry for companies who are just going to be in connectors and plenty of room in the industry for companies who are just going to be specialized in sensors and that's -- there are many who will be very successful doing so but I think for our company this has so far been a really good strategy. Craig Lampo : In regards to the profitability of the acquisitions that these two great companies are at -- you know relatively small, $25 million in aggregate from an annual revenue perspective -- they are not so much different from the company average well below the company average but they're not going to have much of a drag on the overall profitability, just to either size. So in terms of that I wouldn't have pointed out that as something that would have any impact really on the profitability going forward. We do a lot of things as it relates to other acquisitions and sometimes they come in our profitability level, sometimes they are above, sometimes they are below, and there is a lot of levers that ultimately we push, but ultimately it's the operations and acquisitions jobs ultimately to do all that. We talked about it before, we don't think about acquiring companies and having synergies or any things of that nature but we really look at -- we work with the general managers and our groups work with them and they find kind of the places that they think that makes sense for that operation. And then the general managers of those operations are responsible for executing and historically, that's been a great strategy for us and certainly don't see that changing in the future. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Joe Giordano of Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Just quick question on IT Datacom; what specifically is driving the shift in outlook there? And kind of the bigger picture; of some of the big recession what can trip up the trends in that -- in my data transmission, it seems like one of the most powerful things I can kind of think of. So what should we be on the lookout for and if it's like to -- that can potentially change the underlying structure there? Adam Norwitt : I think our positive view of IT Datacom comes number one because we had a really strong quarter here and it comes from the outlooks that we're hearing from our customers. We've been talking for a long time about the growing strength of the company's position in the IT Datacom market and that strength which we've developed organically as well as through the number of acquisitions and most notably, the acquisition of FCI that that we made now 2.5 years ago. And I think the strength comes from a few areas; I mean clearly high-speed products where we have the industry's leading solutions for helping our customers manage through this flood of data traffic that they are trying to deal with. I mean the data traffic is just unbelievable, and when you look at some of the drivers of that whether that's online video which is the most traditional driver of data traffic, I mean which just continues to explode, online gaming which continues to explode, and then these new applications and I mentioned in my prepared remarks when we talked about the automotive market -- while it's still a very small and nascent segment of the automotive market this whole thought of autonomous driving and what that entails from a data perspective -- it really just makes your head spin when you think about the amount of data that's being created to support it, an autonomous car, and the amount of data that a single car is creating over the course of a day, a week, and a year; I mean you're talking in terms of not gigabytes or megabytes but terabytes and petabytes of data that these vehicles are creating in order to map the environment that they're in, and we're obviously at the very, very earliest stages of that kind of a revolution in the automotive industry which then has that knock-on effect of how you're going to process all that data. And so I think that ultimately that trend of the expansion of data is something that we're capitalizing on the near-term and in the long-term. Now, look -- I mean what can trip it up? I mean, look -- I don't know, there is a lot of things that can trip things up, I mean you imagine a big recession -- there have been lots of dislocations in the IT Datacom market and I think you will recall that there were a number of years where actually the overall IT market was not very robust, we did pretty well during that time period because we quickly pivoted towards some of the service provider opportunities, the web service providers, and we were able to really transform our approach to customers in order to capitalize on where the spending still was but it's a very dynamic market, you have lots of innovation, lots of startup companies, lots of new technologies that are coming out there and there is no doubt about it, I mean there is change always underfoot in the IT Datacom market and so what could trip up the market who knows I think is the answer. But for us what's important is that we've got to remain nimble enough that regardless of what dislocations come along we'll still be able to get our leading products to the right customers who need those products. And I think if we can keep doing that we'll be in decent shape. Joseph Giordano : On the auto side in terms of your growth, can you flush out regionally how that played out in terms of your forward guidance, any kind of like second derivative changes in one versus the other, regionally? Adam Norwitt : We had actually in the second quarter really strong performance on a broad basis, actually -- I think organically it was virtually the same across each of the regions, Europe, Asia and North America. I mean I think when I look at our automotive business, the snapshot of it here in the second quarter -- I mean, we have really transformed the original footprint of that market today where we used to be a business that was going to more than two-thirds, if not three quarters in Europe, and then the rest in North American and little bit in Asia. And now when I look at it, I mean Europe is more than a third but less than half, and Asia is around a third, and North America is just a bit less than the third set. It's like the balance that we have achieved across our automotive market is actually really satisfying for the whole team that's working in that space. In terms of the guidance, I mean we don't necessarily guide on a regional basis, and I wouldn't even be able to tell you what what's imbedded in our outlook from a regional basis but I don't think we see any big dislocations or big differences on the regions as we look into the second half. Operator : Our last question is coming from the line of Sara Lindon [ph] on behalf of Mr.Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Just looking at the auto gross [ph] you're experiencing and forecasting, kind of moving forward more broadly could you dive into a little bit what you're seeing in terms of content first production gains from your customers? And then on the content front, like what part of the vehicle are you seeing those content increases? Adam Norwitt : I think that our growth is clearly outperforming overall the automotive production numbers and you will know better than I do what those numbers are, they are very widely reported. And I think we continue to see content, what the number is, I wouldn't really be able to tell you exactly what percent of our overall organic growth in the quarter; I mean we grew 10% organically in the quarter, I would guess the majority of that is either share gain or content because the production is not growing anywhere near that rate. And in terms of the applications, there is a lot to list share and I don't want to keep everybody on the phone all afternoon, but just more broadly, we are seeing -- as I talked about in the industrial market, the adoption of new electronics everywhere in the car, everywhere from new navigation and telematics systems, to safety systems, to more efficient mechanisms for transmissions and engine management, braking systems, hybrid electric drive trend [ph] systems, and even the early beginnings of autonomous or semi-autonomous driving systems. So there is a lot of different applications in the car; I mean you look at a car today and I had the good fortune to ride in a few of these really advanced cars more recently, and -- I mean these are just data centers with wheels on them. And it's our job to make sure that we design our products into every part of that data center on wheels to allow us to participate as these new revolutions continue. Unidentified Analyst : And then quickly need to touching on IT and Datacom; can you expect to continue to see your legacy enterprise business like driving the business forward or would growth be primarily driven in the hyperscale sort of thing? Adam Norwitt : Look, I guess if you look over the last few years, we've seen more growth coming out of the hyper sale or the web service area but we continue to see a lot of efforts and a lot of new technology developments with our -- I wouldn't call them legacy but there are traditional OEM customers who are still designing really advanced equipment and marketing that on a very broad basis. So I think we see still good opportunities in both, I guess that shift that we've been taking advantage of towards web service providers is something that is not changing today, so I suppose if one were to look forward you wouldn't see that that shift is going to go away; so I guess by definition we'd see a little bit more -- continued more strength coming out of the web service provider. But look at the end of the day, I mean we don't really care. I mean for us just what's important is that customers regardless of whether they are OEMs, web service providers or enterprises directly that they are continuing to strive for these new equipment functionalities that can help them deal with data transfer rates expanding as we discussed earlier. And so it's the same job that we have regardless to develop those leading products to make sure that we're doing our part to help the industry in it's totality, capitalize upon, and manage through this really explosion in data traffic. Well, thank you thank you very much. Operator? Operator : We have no longer questions in queue, you may proceed. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much. And again, we appreciate everybody's time today. I wish that everybody has a good continuation of your summer, and we look forward to speaking to everybody in the fall. Thanks again. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference.

LLC Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Jim Suva - Citi Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and of course we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.129 billion and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.01 and $0.99 respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $110 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.06. Sales were up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 17% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the third quarter increased 15%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, our Cable business which comprised 5% of our sales was flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency as compared to the third quarter of last year. And our Interconnect business which comprised 95% of our sales was up 17% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $444 million for the third quarter. And operating margin was a record 20.9% in the third quarter of 2018, up 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2017 of 20.5%, and up 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2018 of 20.6%. From a segment standpoint in the Cable segment, margins were 13.1%, which is flat compared to the third quarter of 2017. And in Interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.7% in the third quarter of 2018, which is compared to the third quarter of last year at 22.4%. This excellent performance is direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $25 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.5% in the third quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate in both periods excludes the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as we have previously discussed. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 including the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises was approximately 23.8% compared to 21.8% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 15% in the third quarter of this year to $1.01 from $0.88 in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises in both periods grew 19% to a record $0.99 in the third quarter of this year from $0.83 in the third quarter of 2017 which also excluded certain acquisition-related expenses. Orders for the quarter were a record $2.12 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $339 million in the quarter or approximately 110% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint; inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $1 billion respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 78 days, 73 days and 63 days respectively which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $339 million along with stock option proceeds of $72 million, short-term borrowings of $19 million, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $29 million net of translation were used primarily to repay a net amount of $194 million under our commercial paper programs, to fund net capital expenditures of $72 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million, to purchase approximately $35 million of the company's stock, and to fund acquisitions of and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of $11 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion three-year open-market stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at September 30, the company had issued approximately $338 million under its U.S. commercial paper program and approximately $513 million under its euro commercial paper program for a total outstanding balance under its commercial paper programs of $851 million. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $3.3 billion and net debt is approximately $2.2 billion. In addition, as previously announced, the company had a successful European senior note issuance, in which the company issued a 10-year \u20ac500 million note on October 8, which has an all-in effective tax rate of just under 2.1%. The company will use the proceeds to repay outstanding debt resulting in an aggregate pro forma balance of approximately $270 million outstanding under its commercial paper programs. The third quarter 2018 EBITDA was approximately $530 million. And from a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to offer my welcome to all of you here on the phone today, and we very much appreciate you spending some of your precious time with us. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the quarter. I'll then spend some time to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then, finally, I'll spend some time to comment on the outlook for the fourth quarter, which is, of course, also the full year of 2018. With respect to the third quarter, I could just say that I'm very pleased that the company, once again, reached new records of performance in the third quarter with sales and earnings both exceeding the high end of our guidance. Revenues in the quarter increased by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically to a new record $2.129 billion. And for the fourth quarter in a row, we booked a record level of orders, in this case, $2.120 billion, which represented still a very robust book-to-bill of 1 :1. Operating margins in the quarter reached a new high, 20.9%. And that's just a clear demonstration of the strength of the company's operating performance, as Craig so eloquently detailed. And then, finally, we delivered record adjusted EPS of $0.99, growing a very strong 19% from prior year. I can only say that I'm just extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. I mean, their ability to respond to the many opportunities in the exciting global electronics market, all while driving excellent operating performance, is clearly reflected in the company's strong third quarter results. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that our end market diversity, once again, was a great asset for the company here in the third quarter. With no market representing more than 20% of our sales, we remain very pleased by the breadth and balance of our end market position. I would just point out that this balance creates great benefits for Amphenol in any economic cycle. And very importantly, we're also pleased that we realized strong organic growth across nearly all of our end markets here in the third quarter. So turning, first, to the military market, the military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. And simply put, we had just another great quarter in the military market. Sales increased from prior year by a better-than-expected 22% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Our growth in military was really broad-based and included aircraft, military vehicle, helicopters, space, and communications segments, in particular. And sequentially, our sales rose by 2% in what is typically a seasonally softer summer quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to remain essentially at these robust levels. And for the full year 2018, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the high teens for the military market, a stronger outlook than we had coming into the quarter. 2018 has no doubt been an excellent year so far for our team working in the military market. They continue to successfully expand our position by driving our broad array of high technology products across the widest range of military applications. In addition, I'm very pleased with our team's ability to react to this increased level of demand from our customers, not always an easy task. And amidst this stronger overall defense spending environment, we look forward to continuing to leverage our high technology position to drive further out-performance into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as we benefited from continued growth in jetliner volumes, as well as increased content on new airplane platforms. Sequentially, sales were slightly down from the second quarter on expected seasonality. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase from prior year. We remain encouraged by our strong performance in the commercial aviation market so far this year and look forward to continued progress going into the future. Our team working in the comm air market has successfully expanded the company's technology position across a wide array of next-generation commercial aircraft, thereby creating a great long-term opportunity for the company. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. And this growth was really driven by expansion in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment, battery and entertainment; again, quite broad-based. As we'd expected coming into the quarter, sales were down seasonally from the second quarter moderating by about 5% sequentially. And looking into the fourth quarter, while we expect sales to further moderate from these levels, we continue to expect mid-teens sales growth for the full year in the industrial market, a very strong performance. We remain confident in the long-term strength of our position in the industrial market. Through our organic product development efforts, together with our ongoing acquisition program, we've built a very robust and diversified suite of interconnect and sensor products for the widest array of industrial applications. As electronics continues to transform these industrial applications, we look forward to realizing the benefits of our excellent position in this important market into the future. Turning to the automotive market, the automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were just a touch softer than expected, but still grew by a very strong 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. Sequentially, sales moderated slightly from the second quarter. They were down by about 4% in U.S. dollars and just about 2% organically on a sequential basis. Looking into the fourth quarter, while we do expect sales to increase modestly from these levels, for the full year 2018, we now expect sales growth in the mid-teens, which while strong is slightly lower than our prior expectations. This reflects some small degree of moderation in demand from certain vehicle manufacturers, as well as their Tier 1 customers. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's strong position in the global automotive market. Our team around the world continues to expand the company's range of high-technology, interconnect products, sensors and antennas for a wide array of applications within vehicles. These developments, together with our ongoing strategy of acquiring companies that offer complementary technologies, has positioned us strongly for the future as carmakers are integrating advanced electronics into fuel-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. In addition, we continue to work aggressively with customers around the world on new advanced technologies. And these include next-generation emissions and drivetrain systems, autonomous and semiautonomous driving, as well as next-generation high-speed data interconnect, just to name a few. All of this creates a great long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales performance in mobile devices was much stronger than expected here in the quarter, as we were able to execute on increased customer demand for both new and existing programs. Sales rose by very strong 30% from prior year driven by higher sales of products incorporated into smartphones, together with strengthened performance related to laptops and wearables. Sales increased significantly from the second quarter rising by an impressive 72% sequentially. I just cannot emphasize enough how our team working in this extraordinarily dynamic mobile devices market was able to quickly ramp up in the face of higher than expected requirements from our customers. And thereby once again, demonstrating their outstanding agility and reactivity. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest increase in sales from these currently high levels. And in light of our significant outperformance in the third quarter as well as our more favorable view of the fourth quarter, and of course understanding as always the inherent volatility in the mobile devices market. We now expect sales for the full year 2018 to increase by somewhere approximating 30%. This compares to our prior guidance of mid to high teens sales growth, as we came out of the second quarter. Our team working in the mobile devices market continues to just do a fantastic job expanding our position in this exciting space. And while the mobile devices market is certainly not predictable, the agility of our team working in mobile devices continues to enable us to drive great success. Their reactivity in meeting the challenging and ever-changing demands from customers, all while continuing to develop innovative, next-generation products and manufacturing processes has secured our leading position in this important market. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of this position for many years to come. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and we drove better performance than expected in the third quarter with sales growing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Our growth this quarter was in particular led by stronger sales to mobile network equipment vendors. Sequentially, our sales were slightly lower than the second quarter due to the impact of normal seasonality which we had anticipated. While, we expect some modest reduction in sales from these levels into the fourth quarter, we now expect low double-digit sales growth for the full year 2018 which is a more favorable outlook than we had 90 days ago. We're encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, as well as by our improved full year outlook for the mobile networks market. And while we do not believe the strength is yet driven by significant investments in 5G networks, our position in the mobile networks market in those next-generation systems continues to strengthen. Our team remains focused on working to broaden our range of high-technology products sold into both equipment manufacturers and service providers as they prepare for the next generation of mobile network construction. As we look to the future, we look forward to realizing the benefits of these important efforts. Information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and our team working in IT datacom really drove excellent and stronger than expected performance in this market with sales growing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically from prior year, as well as 6% sequentially from the prior quarter. Our growth in the third quarter was broad-based across servers, storage and networking product and was supported by our sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as to the new generation of web service providers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these high levels. But nevertheless, we now expect sales for the full year to grow in the low double digits from 2017 which is a more positive outlook than we had anticipated coming out of last quarter. Our position in the IT datacom market is as strong as ever, as we continue to extend our leadership in developing a wide array of next-generation products in high-speed, power and fiber-optics for a broad range of equipment manufacturers and web service providers around the world. As customers continue to accelerate data center performance, in order to manage what is clearly an explosive growth of online traffic, we remain confident that our high technology offering positions us strongly for the future. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales reduced slightly from prior year by about 3% as cable operators continued to moderate their spending. On a sequential basis, sales were flat to the prior quarter which was a bit softer than we had expected coming into the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full year 2018, we continue to expect that our sales will be approximately at the same level as last year. Despite our relatively muted outlook for the year, we're still confident in the strength of our position in the broadband market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our expanded product offering in support of customers who are delivering data, video and voice to consumers and businesses around the world. So just in summary and with respect to the third quarter, just simply put I'm extremely pleased with the company's strong results as the entire Amphenol organization continued to execute extraordinarily well in expanding our market position while strengthening the company's financial performance. And Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages; our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a very broad and diverse range of markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and then really most importantly, it's all on the basis of an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year, the overall demand environment no doubt remains strong. But nevertheless there are uncertainties in the global marketplace and in particular related to geopolitics and trade. So assuming no significant changes to the current economic and geopolitical environment and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $2.063 billion to $2.103 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.96 to $0.98. This represents a sales and adjusted diluted EPS increase versus prior year of 6% to 8% and 12% to 14% respectively. For the full year 2018, we now expect sales in the range of $8.040 billion to $8.080 billion together with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.68 to $3.70. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15% and 18% to 19% over 2017 levels respectively. But also note that, this outlook now represents full year organic sales growth of approximately 12%, and that's a significant increase from our prior organic growth guidance of 8% to 9%. So just in closing, I just want to say that, we're encouraged by the company's strong third quarter results as well as our strengthened outlook. And I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon these great third quarter results by continuing to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position, while delivering superior financial performance in 2018 and beyond. And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions that there maybe. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answers period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. This is Ziv Israel filling in for Wamsi. There have been a lot of concerns about China growth lately. What have you seen specifically that is \u2013 are there positive or negative around China demand? Any color there will be helpful. And if you can put it in context of any prior China weakness you've seen that would be very helpful. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you very much. Look I don't think we have seen any notable changes to the demand in Asia or in China. We have a very broad business on a global basis and we have a very broad and localized business as well in China. We have always prided ourselves on being a true local participant in the market. And that is part and parcel to the way that we're organized. Whether that is in North America, in Europe, in India, in China, wherever, we rely on local teams of entrepreneurial managers to run our business and that's really part of the real essence of the Amphenol culture. And how that manifests itself in places like China is just in a very positive fashion in that our team really is seen by Chinese customers, by global customers, as being not only a stable team, but one who truly understands the local market and can work on a level playing field with anybody else, including those local participants. If we look across the various markets, I would say that there haven't been anything notable in China. We haven't seen any notable slowdowns. There are always, in any given year, ups and downs, but we haven't seen anything that is markedly different than in other years. Ziv Israel - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks. That's all I have. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Adam, so just in some of the more cyclical markets, be it industrial or automotive, you did point out that things slowed or weakened a little bit. Anything there in terms of just customers reacting to kind of slower growth or inventory, anything on autos and industrial you can point out? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think autos and industrial, I wouldn't group them, Craig, necessarily into just one category. I think we came into the year with a certain outlook on industrial and we're still standing behind that outlook. We still see that market as a kind of a mid-teens growth market for the year, and I think our team has just done a really wonderful job in that space. I think automotive, I did point out that we've seen just really a slight change to the negative in terms of the outlook from customers. I mean, this has been broadly reported. I don't think we're going to say anything different than what has been broadly talked about, but this is just a general reflection of a little bit of reduction in demand outlook as we head into second half and as we head, in particular, into the fourth quarter. When we look at our performance in automotive, I would say that, on a regional basis, we've been a bit stronger in North America and Asia, maybe a little bit weaker in Europe. I don't think that that is much different than also a lot of the broad reporting about the overall trends in the market. But what is just really important from our perspective, you can have always volumes going up and volumes going down and demand for volumes going up and down for a wide variety of reasons. And again, I think you all know many of those reasons. But what is critical for us is there is not a change in that adoption and the pace of adoption of electronics into cars and into industrial equipment. We continue to see just an incredible array of opportunities to really expand our position \u2013 irregardless of the overall trends, to expand our position long term by working with our customers on a very broad basis to enable new technologies; and, in the industrial market that's really with interconnect and sensors. In the automotive market, it's interconnect and sensors and antennas. And I think all of those trends that we in our company and others in the industry have benefited for such a long time; it's not that those trends are changing whatsoever. Now, I'm not going to be the one to try to give a prognosis about what volumes are going to be beyond here in the fourth quarter. There's lots of people who are much more expert than I am to do that. But what we clearly continue to see is the long-term trend of the adoption of electronics, the enhanced electronic functionality, new applications, new systems. That trend is certainly not changing or slowing down by any token. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Appreciate all the color there. And then, as my follow-up for mobile devices, I know there's a lot of attention placed on one particular customer, but just given the strength that you're seeing as I look at the mobile device market, and particularly China smartphones, that the high-end capabilities you're seeing today in those phones, can you give any context in terms of the significance of that in terms of the high-end of the market kind of broadening out? And is that something that might be helping you? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. It's a really good point, and I have talked for many, many years about this market under the context of the fact that we are choosy in this market in such as that we will participate where there is really technology being embedded in the hardware of the mobile devices. And that's been a topic for, I think, the whole decade that I have been CEO of this company, which is our mobile device is eventually just kind of empty hosts for software. And we've always said that we will participate in those mobile devices where our technology, our capabilities really have value for the customer. And that will come when there's really a premium put on the hardware. And I think what you are seeing on a broad basis around the world is that the phone manufacturers, the service providers, they all know that you cannot just sell these sort of commoditized empty hosts for software and have any differentiating capability. You've got to have features in the phones. You've got to have features in the tablets. You've got to have features in the laptops and the wearables and all those various things that are mobile devices. And those features have very complex requirements. They require an incredible degree of precision. They require an incredible capability, both in design and manufacturing. And so, when we see our team really driving the success that they have here, I think it is exactly in line with our long-term expectations that hardware will continue to have real meaning to the proposition that phone manufacturers and operators make to their customers. And so, whether that's in China or whether that's in other places around the world, I think you do see lots of attempts at differentiating through the hardware, through the functionality of the devices, and we're there to support that in every place possible. And so, I think that underlying trend of hardware, there's no doubt about it, still a very positive trend for the company. Look, all that being said, and I said it in my prepared remarks and I will say it always till I'm blue in the face, it's a volatile market. And it's one where you've got to be extraordinarily agile and reactive to the demand requirements of your customer. And if you can do that consistently, be reactive, be supportive when they need you, and if you can do that with enabling capabilities and technologies, then you have a pretty good long-term position in this space. And I think that's been our recipe, so far, and will continue to be our recipe going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn M. Harrison - Longbow Research LLC : Hi, morning and congrats \u2013 or I guess, afternoon, sorry. Congratulations on the results. Two questions. First, just on the mobile networks business, continuing to see some strength there, was there any regional dynamics of stronger trends in the third quarter and now for the year relative to where you were 90 days ago? And then second, it's my topic de jure as of late, the lack of M&A activity in terms of just spend relative to your free cash flow. It lagged in 2017, you're lagging 2018 here year-to-date. Is there anything that's pressuring the activity other than just pure timing? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean with respect to mobile networks, as you heard, we had a very strong quarter in mobile networks. I would say that the strength that we saw was more North America and Asia related and Europe was not so strong in wireless. So, it wasn't necessarily regionally balanced. It was balanced across Asia and North America, but not so balanced across Europe. But that is maybe not necessarily surprising given the overall trends in that space, but we were just really happy with how that came out. We hadn't expected coming into the quarter. I think coming into the year, in fact, when we started out this year, we didn't have such a favorable view of the mobile networks market. And I think our team has just done an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities that have presented themselves to us, while also doing the really hard work of making sure that we're well-positioned for the future, and in particular, for the future of whatever that next generation is 5G or otherwise. And so that's \u2013 I think, the team has done just a really outstanding job here on really a global basis. Now, relative to M&A, I've said it many times. I mean we cannot control the timing of M&A. We continue to work very hard and we have an outstanding pipeline of M&A. But the fact that we didn't close any deals in the quarter should not be at all an indication of any change in appetite or change in strategy, change of approach, or change of opportunity. I would argue that 2017, we had a pretty good year in M&A. We bought quite a number of really good companies, understanding that as a percent of free cash flow it was maybe a little bit lower than the prior year, but in the prior year, we made the largest acquisition in the history of the company. So, I wouldn't read anything long-term into that and we continue to have a strong pipeline for M&A. And I will say that we continue to have just a very, very compelling proposition to those companies who really want to join and be a part of something great, to be a part of an organization that is extraordinarily hospitable to them as entrepreneurs, to be a part of a company that has just extraordinarily \u2013 extraordinary breadth and reach from a customer and geographical and technology perspective. It's a very, very compelling proposition for companies when they're deciding to whom do they want to sell and where do they want their company to end up. We're not going to win every deal that we've said all along. We're going to remain very disciplined on price regardless of environment and we've said that when interest rates were low. We'll say that as interest rates go up. We've said that when stock valuations were high, when stock valuations were low. We've been very consistent about that that we take a long-term approach to acquisitions in a way where we say we're going to get to know them very, very well. We're going to buy companies on the basis of great people, great product and great position. We're going to be very patient through those processes. And when we buy them, they're going to be ours for life. And that's a very, very important principle. And I think, it's been a consistently successful principle in our acquisition program. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First question is on tariffs and Adam you spoke about tariffs last quarter and some of the steps Amphenol was taking to avoid or mitigate those issues. So I was wondering if you can provide an update on that topic both to what extent Amphenol has seen any direct impact on its own financial from tariffs and whether you think tariffs are having an impact at all on customer order patterns or demand? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, no question, Mark, appreciate that. Tariffs continue to be a thing. Unfortunately, it is what it is. I would just say that what I discussed last quarter in terms of our approach and our methodology to dealing with tariffs has not changed. And let me just remind everybody about that. I mean, first and foremost, tariffs are just a thing that happened. It's not something over which we have control. While we try to lend our voice very passionately to the debate about whether or not there should be tariffs, they are what they are. And so the question then is, how do you react to those tariffs? And what we have done in our company not surprisingly given our organization and how we choose to operate this company is, we've not taken a one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with the tariffs. We have really pushed down that decision-making to those \u2013 to the general managers around the world who are implicated, who have to deal with those tariffs. And then those who operate at that level are the best equipped to know the logistics, the manufacturing processes, the supply chain. How those products are made? Where they're shipped to? Who are the customers? And ultimately, who are the competitors? And thereby make wise and real-time decisions about the measures that one can take to mitigate. And there are really countless measures that one can take in this event, whether that is changing the location of manufacturing, changing where value is created, changing how things are flowing into what countries, or of course, adjusting price, which we do with a heavy heart to our customers, but which you must do sometimes. And I think that the combination of those very operation part-number-by-part-number specific initiatives has ultimately resulted in the third quarter when we had quite a lot of tariffs that we had to deal with in the company really not having any meaningful impact from those tariffs. And I think, when you see ultimately the operating margins of the company 20.9%, I mean, that is also a reflection of the fact that these tariffs did not have any meaningful damage to our financial position. Now there's new tariffs every day. There's more tariffs to deal with here in the fourth quarter and I'm sure there will be more next year. And one day hopefully this whole thing will get resolved. But right now, we're managing it because it is what it is. And so, as we move forward, if there are new tariffs, if there are new levels of tariffs, I'm confident that our team is going to work extremely hard in that same methodology, ultimately to make sure that Amphenol as a corporation is not harmed by what I consider relatively misguided policies. Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And a follow-up question on the IT datacom market which has been reporting stronger results than the company had anticipated at the start of the year. Can you help deconstruct that a bit more between the piece for hyperscale and the piece tied to more traditional OEMs? And I'm curious, if hyperscale is now a big enough portion that you could help us better understand what percentage of IT datacom business is tied to hyperscale at this point. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I don't have a number for you in terms of what percentage it is. But it has continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, but I would tell you still it's smaller by some significance to our sales to equipment manufacturers. I think we've seen very broad-based growth in the IT datacom market in particular here in the third quarter. We saw really growth across all the different types of products. So whether that's storage, server, networking. I mean, those were all very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. And I wouldn't say that there was really a concentration of that into one or another type of customer, one or another region. It was very, very broad-based. And why is that? I mean, we certainly see, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks that, the degree of technology advantage that we have developed over a number of years and that included both acquisitions that we made, our own organic product development. The breadth of product offering that we have and the depth of that offering, all the products across the price-performance curve allows us and enables us to really be a strong, and really leading partner with our customers regardless of whether they are making a carrier class router on one side, or a blade server, a rack server on the other side and everything in between. And so, it's the strength of that product technology, together with the breadth of what we're able to offer those customers that has ultimately allowed us to have that more balanced and broad-based strength in the IT datacom market. I think, we feel very good about that position because it comes really at a time when the demands put on IT hardware on a global basis continue to accelerate. Just you can't pick up a paper lately without seeing some new innovation, some new development that is generating amounts of data that you can't even imagine. I think, I saw a story this week about this sort of deep space telescope which apparently is going to generate in a year as much data as the whole Internet today occupies. And you think about this sort of exponential growth of data that is being created and things like that, things like autonomous driving, things like video on the Internet, and high-definition video. And I think the matching of our unique and proprietary technologies together with that accelerated data traffic is ultimately the story that results in these results. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thank you. Adam, you've done a good job by answering questions here and giving good color. One follow-up, just regarding your comments on the telecom and mobile network area, you talked about strength in really the non-5G areas and there's a lot of talk about ramping in the back half of next year into 2020 in terms of ramps. How are you seeing that play out in terms of how you're positioned specifically with technology and customers? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, I don't \u2013 I can't give you a timing of ramp of 5G, but what I can tell you is that our position is very strong. I mean, our team has been working for a number of years to make sure that our products are designed in on next-generation systems in the broadest sense possible. And if you think back about what is 5G from an equipment and a performance perspective. 5G is all about speed and latency. And to get really the levels of speed and the reductions in latency that are being really targeted from a 5G and to do that all at frequency sets that are much higher than current networks are operating which thereby requires much more density, I mean that's a lot of technology that gets embedded into these products. And the interconnect products that are used in those systems and are being designed into those systems just in certain cases have real step function performance requirements. And so I give a lot of credit to our organization, our engineers around the world who've worked with customers to make sure that our products are really front and center as they go through those design considerations. And look while you don't have a \"5G\" in the IT datacom space that we were just talking about with Mark's question, it's a very similar dynamic that you have to have really that leading product and that leading suite of products such that customers can rely upon your products to help their systems perform at these extremely high levels that everybody is hoping to achieve with 5G. When the timing is going to be and I can tell you we're involved in a lot of build-outs and systems and products where there may be what's called 5G ready, does that mean they are performing in 5G networks, probably not. But we already see customers producing equipment that is forwards compatible for 5G and things like that. So as usual in these generational changes in mobile networks there's a long lead up. There's a lot of test and validation, design work. And then the building out of that system, I think, starts to go slowly and eventually you'll have \u2013 then have some meaning to the overall spending environment. But when that's going to be is a little bit hard for us to predict. Matthew John Sheerin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Fair enough, okay. Thanks a lot. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks so much, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. I have two questions as well, guys. I guess, first one, Adam, nice to see the upside you guys have on mobile devices. I think you said it was up 70% plus sequentially in September. When you think about what drove the upside versus what you guys thought it would be 90 days ago, do you think it's more driven by the fact that others that were involved in the same components couldn't execute the way they were supposed to, which I think has happened in the past? Or was it that end demand was just better in the products you're involved in? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think in this case, the demand was better and our ability to execute on the demand was a bit better than we had anticipated. If you just think about the mechanics and logistics of in a 90-day period having an increase in sales of 70% in a market, which is not so small on an absolute basis. I mean, there's a lot of hard work involved. And I just cannot credit enough our organization, who really made that happen. And when we say make it happen in Amphenol that has a real meaning to the people inside the Amphenol organization. And they really made it happen here. I mean, whether that is getting the production lines in place, getting the right people in place, getting the factories set-up, I mean, all the things that are required. And this is a team, where this is not their first rodeo, either, as you know, very well, Amit. I mean, this \u2013 we're used to having these significant increases, but it doesn't make them any easier. It just makes you maybe a little bit more confident, in hindsight, that you can do it, again, when it comes around. But again, the simple answer to your question, I think, this was probably less us having to bail people out like we've done in the past and more the volumes being a little bit better and our ability to execute on those volumes being a little bit better on a broad basis. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. That's helpful. And if I could follow-up, you guys obviously are seeing broad-based trends in September; sounds like it's going to continue in December. I heard your comments around tariffs. I'm just wondering, right, tariffs are supposed to go to 25% on January 1 for a lot of products. Is your response and tone (48:45) going to be any different at 10% tariff or 25% tariff? And then, importantly, why do you think customers are not double ordering at this point? If I know cost of connectors goes up by 25%, I might be better off buying more today versus waiting for January 1, and do you think that creates a risk for a bit of a vacuum in the first half of 2019? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, there's a lot in that, but let's just be a little specific about what tariffs and when. As you know, there've been three lists of tariffs. There was what was called List 1, List 2, and then List 3. And if you look at the products that are in those \u2013 in List 1, there was a product line called connectors. So \u2013 and that was already at 25%. So List 1 and 2 were at 25%. It was List 3 that has this sort of step one at 10%, and then the second step is 25%. Are customers kind of hoarding or overbuying, in that instance? We haven't seen that, necessarily. Could there be some on the margins? I suppose there could be some, but that's also constrained by just the ability to support those demands. And it's not that you have infinite capacity to support that pull in of demand. Obviously, we'll do whatever we can with our customers. And also bear in mind that the tariffs are due when the product moves into the U.S., which is not always necessarily when you sell it to the customer. And so, that dynamic that you described is just not as clear. And we haven't seen any real clear indications of that pulling forward. I think the bigger question around tariffs, and that's one that I'm really not well equipped to answer, is what ultimately is the effect of these tariffs? Where does it resolve? Does that ultimately have any macro economical effects? Does it have other effects? Those are all things that are probably above my pay grade to think about, or at least to make a forecast about. But I think how we deal with the 10%, how we deal with the 25% of that List 3, it's going to be the same way we've dealt with the tariffs that have come so far. And we've had significant products that have been susceptible to those tariffs. Again, not forgetting about the fact that, by and large, the vast majority of what we make we make and sell in the same region. And that's part of the strategy that we've always taken of being localized to our customers, and so we're not talking about an enormous proportion of our business here; far from that. But there is some that we have to deal with and I think we've dealt with it well so far, and our team will continue to fight like heck to do so regardless of what tariff levels come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Two quick questions from me. One is automotive risk. It looks like the organic growth came in a point or two below your expectations. Just curious how much of that was market versus content coming in softer versus expectations? And what's your comfort with continuing your strong high single-digit content growth performance, if the weakness continues well into next year? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I mean, one to two points organic, I guess, it's kind of hard for me to say is that market or content. But as I said earlier, we don't see any signs of content slowing down. I mean, far from it. We continue to see new electronic systems being adopted into cars. So I guess, without knowing exactly what the drivers of the one or two points of organic change, I would say that it's probably the market. And I think I said earlier that we continued to see \u2013 have a very favorable view, long-term, towards the continued expansion of electronic content in cars around the world. And what the market will be, what the total value \u2013 or total units of cars is going to be, that's much harder for us to predict. But I think we still feel comfortable that content is going to continue to grow. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. My follow-up is on semiconductor supply chain. Are you seeing any impacts from this well-broadcasted passive shortages, either directly or indirectly? And generally, has that headwind abated? Has that accelerated? I mean, just curious. I mean, it's something that seems to have hit a lot of companies this quarter? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, thank you. No, I think we've talked about that for a couple of quarters and it's a well reported \u2013 as you correctly point out, it's a very well-reported discussion about, in particular, passives and, I guess, some semiconductors. We have not seen any meaningful impact on the demand of our customers due to these shortages that are so widely reported. I think we're still performing very strongly. On an absolute basis, our growth has probably accelerated over the course of the year, and I think that that's a sign that it hasn't been any real meaningful impact. Have our people spent a little bit more time because there are some of these passives and other assorted components that we once in a while buy for some of our more advanced products? Sure, our sourcing team around the world is working maybe a little bit of overtime to make sure that we don't have any impact on our supply to customers. But the sort of ancillary question of, are customers buying less from us, in general, because they can't get the matching component, while there may be an odd anecdote about that, I can't say that that's had any meaningful impact to the performance. Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. If I can sneak just one more in, sorry. Your performance no way indicates that end markets have lost momentum broadly. But my question is what is the sentiment at your customer base that are buying your products? Has that moderated versus 90 days ago? I mean, obviously that's a big deviation from the weak market sentiment we're seeing. I mean just curious what your thoughts are there? And I'll pass it on. Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, thank you. Look I don't think I would say anything different about the sentiment than is reflected in our guidance here for the fourth quarter, which I think continues to be a very strong guidance. I think our customers continue to be very positive, at least, the ones that I have interfaced with and I visit lots of customers on a very frequent basis. I think our customers are continuing to look for us to do the same thing that we've done in many cases, which is to deliver to them enabling technologies that helps them to get their systems to operate at higher levels. We've talked about that with IT, with mobile networks, but the same is true in military where we've done a fantastic job to both produce and design advanced technology products, but also to satisfy a level of demand that probably that industry hasn't seen for quite some time. We talked about that in automotive as well where customers while there's been some slight moderation in the overall demand that demand for new technologies has really not changed, so. And I could go through the markets, all of them, and all reflect on the fact that I think our customers are very positive about the future. Our customers are very thirsty for next-generation technologies. If there are short-term swings in demand that is what it is I think for some of them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva - Citi: Thanks very much. Adam and Craig, any comments on what you see for inventory levels, whether it be distribution, your customers across the supply chain, because we got to think that giving the tariffs as well as uncertainty and very strong or longer than normal lead-times, one has to wonder about excess inventory or double bookings and will that show itself in a positive manner now and catch up to us? Or simply are your lead-times smaller than say maybe semiconductor companies that have a longer lead-time? Thank you. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks very much Jim. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into the warehouses of our customers. We do see the inventory levels of a good degree of our distribution channel and I think their inventories seem healthy, nothing really notable in our distributors. Look, with all the things that you very astutely pointed out, things like tariffs and the various lead-times and double bookings and all of that, I think a lot of those things are much more related to these passives and semiconductors that Deepa alluded to. Remember that our industry is a different industry and the way we run our company is, once again, a little bit different. It's not a capital-intensive industry and certainly the way that we run Amphenol is not in a capital-intensive fashion. Our ability to react and to adjust to changes in demand, be those on the upside which is a bit more fun, but also on the downside, is really a reflection of that agility that we have from manufacturing perspective. And owing to that agility, we're able to keep our lead-times relatively stable. There are some anecdotes that once in a while where lead-times will go out and I think we've maybe seen a little bit of lead-time stretch in the military market with the extraordinary increase in demand there. But by and large, the way that we operate and the way that the interconnect industry operates is very different from the semiconductor and the passives industry. And thus, I think you see a healthier supply chain behavior with respect to those things that you mentioned, like double booking and other items (59:11). Jim Suva - Citi: Thanks so much for the details. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our last question in queue comes from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering how lean are your operations at this point in the cycle in terms of capacity and utilization rates. And if you have anything you would like to highlight in terms of CapEx spending going forward? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. Well, I would just say that we always operate in a very efficient fashion. I think I just \u2013 when we just talked with Jim about inventory levels, I mentioned that from a capital spending it's not a capital-intensive business. The way that we operate our factories is a fast and flexible fashion. So from that perspective, we're always operating lean. And that's part and parcel to the Amphenol culture. It's not that we try to get ahead of things and build huge capacities and then wait for the orders to come and nor do we when times are good, burst at the seams and can't support our customers. So we try always to scale our operational infrastructure to the demands of the customers regardless of what cycle we're in. And I think when you look over a long time period at the performance of the company, especially during volatile economic times, you'll see that that reflects exactly that principle ultimately in the numbers. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: And the only thing, I guess, I would add on that is as you see this year we have had a little bit higher end of our range from a capital spending perspective. I mean, we have had pretty high levels of growth organically over the first three quarters and certainly guidance for the year here. And in those years while we do have a more significant growth, we certainly do spend a little bit more on capital. But again, it's typically within that kind of 2% to 4% and this year we'll be a little bit higher up into that range. But again, that's just driving those high level of growth that we have right now. Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then Adam based on your comments about China and tariffs, I guess, you're still likely to do M&A there in China, I think, with the current situation? R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Yeah. I think I would answer it even more broadly, which is, we don't do M&A. We don't hunt for potential new family members in Amphenol in a way that is trying to chase the market, a hot market or run away from the market that has maybe lost favor in the electronics industry. We take a very, very long-term view towards acquisitions. Our criteria for acquisitions remains very consistent. I alluded to it earlier. We look for great people. We look for great products or in other words technology and we look for fantastic market position. And sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's perceived to be the right time and sometimes we'll make acquisitions when it's not perceived to be the right time. And that's all part and parcel of a strategy that says we're buying these companies for the long-term, which is really for a permanent basis. We believe in Amphenol that when we make these acquisitions, we're getting married for life to those companies and to those organizations. And so whether you buy that in one quarter when that's the right place to be or in another quarter where it's not as much of the right place to be that for us is less important. So if the right company comes along, fabulous entrepreneurs, great products, great market position and that happens to be in China or that happens to be in a market space that is not necessarily the hottest space of the moment, we're not going to shy away from that. And along with that I will tell you, regardless, we're always going to be reasonable in terms of our valuation and disciplined in terms of the process of the acquisition. And I think that approach, which is really an approach that is agnostic to short-term variations in market trends and environments is one that has served us very well over the long term. Now, if there are governmental impediments that are put in place, very significant governmental impediments that are put in place, obviously we're not blind to that. And we would be very sensitive to that because any company that we buy, we want to make sure that there are not structural impediments to success. But I don't think we see that in any geography today of any significance. Operator : Thank you. And speakers we show no further questions in queue at this time. R. Adam Norwitt - Amphenol Corp.: Well, that's very nice. And again, thank you all very much and we truly appreciate your time today and your interest in the company. And I wish you all a very enjoyable fall season and that we will look forward to seeing you just at the beginning of 2019. Thank you all very much. Craig A. Lampo - Amphenol Corp.: Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. You may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2018 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2018 results were released this morning. I will provide you with some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2,225,000,000 and with record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.09 and $1.05, respectively, exceeding the high end of the company's guidance for sales by approximately $122 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.07. Sales were up 14% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the fourth quarter increased 14%. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies and organically, breaking down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprise 5% of our sales, was up 12% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in local currency compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The interconnect business, which comprise the remainder of our sales, was up 15% in U.S. dollars from last year, driven primarily by organic growth.  For the full year 2018, sales were a record $8,202,000,000. Sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars and in local currency, and up a very strong 14% organically compared to 2017, an excellent performance. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Adjusted operating income was $466 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted operating margin was a record 21% in the fourth quarter of '18, up 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '17 of 20.5%, and up 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of '18 of 20.9%.  From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 11.9%, which is up compared to 11.2% in the fourth quarter of '17. In the interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is up compared to the fourth quarter of last year at 22.4%. For the full year 2018, the company delivered $1,695,000,000 in adjusted operating income, up a strong 18% from 2017. We continue to be very pleased with the company's adjusted operating margin achievement, both with the achievement of 20.7% for the full year as well as 21% for the fourth quarter. This excellent performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $26 million, which is comparable to last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the tax charge in 2017 and related finalization in 2018 resulting from the Tax Act, as well as the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises and the tax effect of acquisition-related costs incurred in the 2018 period. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018, including the items just mentioned, was approximately 21%, compared to 126.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, the adjusted effective tax rate was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and '17, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the tax charge in 2017 and related finalization in 2018 resulting from the Tax Act, as well as the excess tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises and tax effect of acquisition-related costs incurred in both periods. On a GAAP basis, including the items just mentioned, the company's full year effective tax rate was approximately 23% and 51% for 2018 and '17, respectively. Adjusted net income was a strong 15% and 14% of sales in the fourth quarter of '18 and for the full year '18, respectively. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $1.09 in the fourth quarter of '18, compared to a loss of $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.85, compared to $2.06 in 2017. Both periods reflect the one-time tax and other items previously mentioned. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% to a record $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2018 from $0.86 in the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year 2018, adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.77, up 21% over 2017 at $3.12. This strong growth was supported by excellent operating performance, as reflected in the company's strong operating margins.  Orders for the quarter were a record $2,198,000,000, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of '17, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $378 million in the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion in the full year or approximately 116% and 94% of adjusted net income, respectively. The full year amount includes the previously mentioned payment of approximately $81 million to fully fund our U.S. pension plans, as well as higher-than-normal tax-related payments during 2018 due to the Tax Act. Excluding both of these items, the cash flow from operations was 108% of adjusted net income for the full year.  From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.8 billion and $890 million, respectively, at the end of December. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 74, 73 and 53 days, respectively, which were all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $378 million, along with proceeds from the eurobond offering of $572 million, were used primarily to purchase approximately $255 million of the company stock. We repaid $245 million under our commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities to fund net capital expenditures of $101 million and to fund dividend payments of $69 million, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $272 million, net of translation.  During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares of stock at an average price of approximately $87 under the $2 billion, three year open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to approximately 11 million shares or $935 million. At December 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. At December 31, 2018, the company had issued approximately $624 million under its U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. And the company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.7 billion.  Total debt at December 31 of '18 was approximately $3.6 billion, and net debt is approximately $2.3 billion. In addition, and as previously announced on January 7, the company successfully launched a $500 million U.S. bond offering, which has a 10-year term and bears interest at 4.35%. The company will use the proceeds from the note issuance, as well as capacity under its U.S. commercial paper program, to repay the upcoming maturity of its $750 million U.S. senior note, which is due at the end of this month. As a result of the new 10-year bond offering just mentioned, which carries with it a higher interest rate than the rate on the $750 million note maturing at the end of January, as well as considering the rising interest rate environment impacting our variable rate debt, we expect our quarterly interest expense from 2019 to increase to approximately $30 million.  The fourth quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $585 million, bringing the company's full year EBITDA to a record $2 billion. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter and year. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a brief comment relative to 2019 guidance. As mentioned in our press release, our significant beat in sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the high end of our guidance was primarily driven by incremental strength in the mobile devices market, along with strength in IT datacom and communications market, partially offset by some additional weakness experienced in the automotive market. Given the incremental strength in the mobile devices market in the fourth quarter, we expect a commensurate decline in the mobile devices market in the first quarter, which will result in a higher-than-typical seasonal reduction in mobile devices sales. This decline is reflected in our higher-than-typical seasonal decline in our first quarter guidance, as well as in our full year growth expectations. In addition, we expect that our tax rate may come down slightly in 2019. At this point, we expect this reduction to be a maximum of 50 basis points, which is reflected in our 2019 guidance.  I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Richard Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and thanks to everybody here today joining us at the time of our quarterly earnings call, and I hope it's not too late to wish everybody on the phone a Happy New Year from the winter wonderland here in Connecticut today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to spend a few moments just to highlight some of our fourth quarter and full year achievements. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets, and then, finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year. And of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end.  As Craig detailed, our results in the fourth quarter were substantially stronger than expected, as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted earnings, reaching new records in orders, sales and adjusted earnings per share. Sales grew by a very strong 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies, reaching another new sales record for the company of $2,225,000,000. I would just say that we're pleased, in particular, to have grown organically in the quarter by a very robust 14% year-over-year. The company booked a new record of $2.2 billion in orders in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of just under 1 :1, 0.99, and our adjusted operating margins were once again very strong in the quarter, reaching a new record of 21%.  We also generated strong operating cash flow of $378 million in the fourth quarter, and this is, again, a great reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. I can just say with the fourth quarter how proud I am of the Amphenol team, and I think our results, once again, this quarter, reflect the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, as we continued to perform well amidst the very dynamic market environment of the electronics industry, all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company.  We're very pleased also in the quarter to announce that we've closed here in January just recently the SSI acquisition that was announced back in December. SSI is a provider of high-technology sensors and sensing solutions, based in Janesville, Wisconsin, with annual sales of approximately $180 million. The company, which has operations in Wisconsin as well as in the Czech Republic, offers a wide variety of sensor products, including ultrasonic level sensors, pressure and speed sensors, to customers across the automotive and industrial markets. SSI represents an excellent complement to our growing portfolio of sensor products, which have become a core pillar of our overall interconnect product offering.  As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, it is really our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then successfully bring them into the Amphenol family that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now just with respect to 2018, I would just reflect back and say that 2018 was really a very successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by a very strong 17% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching a new sales record of $8.2 billion for the company.  Organically, we grew by 14%, our highest level in the last eight years and substantially above the levels we had anticipated coming into 2018. Our full year adjusted operating margins for the company reached a new record 20.7%, and that strong level of profitability enabled us to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.77, which grew a strong 21% from prior year. And then, finally, we generated substantial operating and free cash flow of $1.1 billion and $800 million roughly, respectively. Our acquisition program also continue to create great value for the company in 2018, with the acquisitions of CTI, Ardent and All Sensors earlier in the year, and SSI, as I mentioned, just here in January. We're really excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance, in particular, because of just the outstanding and talented individuals that we're so pleased to have welcomed to the Amphenol family. These new managers in the company deepened what is already a very strong bench of Amphenolians around the world.  In addition, in 2018, we bought back nearly 11 million shares under our share buyback program, as well as increasing our quarterly dividend by 21%. I would just say that Amphenol's long-term mission remains the same, that is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. And through the organic development efforts of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, together with the benefits from our acquisition program, we have expanded our partnerships with a broadening array of customers across all of the company's diversified end markets. This has resulted in Amphenol strengthening our position across the many interesting and exciting segments of the electronics industry. And while the overall market environment towards the end of the year did become increasingly uncertain, as we entered 2019, our agile, entrepreneurial management team remains highly confident that we have built a platform of strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance going forward.  Now turning to the company's trends and progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we're pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Once again, for the full year, no market represented more than 19% of our sales. And we truly believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of volatility of individual end markets, while also, very importantly, exposing us to leading technologies, wherever they may arise across the electronics industry.  So turning to those markets. First, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and also 10% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the military market again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by a greater-than-expected 15%, and actually 16% organically, driven by growth in avionics, military vehicles, rotorcraft, as well as ordnance applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% into the normally seasonally softer winter quarter. For the full year 2018, we're very pleased that our military sales grew by an excellent 20% in U.S. dollars and 19% organic, and that really reflects the broad-based strength across virtually all segments of the military market.  Our organization working in this important market has really driven hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position with customers across all segments of the military industry. The company's superior performance in 2018 is yet another great reflection of the results of those significant efforts. And given the ongoing favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify their leadership position by ensuring that we're able to execute on this increased demand by supporting the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.  Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these fourth quarter levels. And for the full year 2019, we expect to achieve high single-digit sales growth on top of our already strong sales levels in 2018.  The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of sales, both in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2018. And sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 10%, as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers continue to be robust. Sequentially, our sales increased by 8% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2018, we're very pleased that our sales grew by 13%, as we benefited from our broad design-ins of next-generation interconnect products on new jetliners. In addition, we were encouraged to also begin to see some improvements in the sales of both business jets and helicopters here in 2018. Looking into the New Year, we expect a slight moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter. But for the full year, we expect a mid-single-digit sales increase as procurement of our products used in commercial jetliners increases. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms in next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come. The industrial market represented 17% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2018. Sales in the fourth quarter were up slightly from prior year as stronger sales in medical, oil and gas and rail mass transit were essentially offset by reductions in heavy equipment, factory automation and alternative energy. On a sequential basis, sales were down by about 4% from the third quarter, reflecting some moderation in the overall industrial market. For the full year 2018, our sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 16% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, driven by excellent performance in medical, battery and electric vehicle, oil and gas and rail mass transit, together with contributions from our acquisition program. No question that 2018 was another excellent year for our teams working in the industrial market. Through both our successful acquisition program as well as our organic innovation, we've developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. I'm very proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. This quarter's addition of SSI to the Amphenol family further strengthens our already robust position in sensors that are used in heavy equipment, factory automation, as well as other very dynamic and high-technology industrial applications.  Looking into the first quarter of 2019, we anticipate a modest sequential increase in sales as we benefit from the addition of SSI. And for the full year 2019, we expect to realize high single-digit sales growth as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions as well as our organic growth efforts. The automotive market represented 16% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 18% of our sales for the full year 2018. Sales were a bit weaker than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, with revenues just up slightly from prior year, as our increased sales of interconnect and sensor products into new applications was nearly offset by moderated vehicle volumes. Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars, and were basically flat organically from the third quarter.  Regardless of this more recent slowing of demand from our customers in the automotive market in the fourth quarter, for the full year 2018, our sales grew by a very strong 14% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically, which is a great performance given the overall trends in global automobile production. We continue to benefit from the company's long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, which enables us to really drive a wide array of products into onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles that are made by auto manufacturers around the world. We're especially excited that the acquisition of SSI significantly bolsters our growing sensor offering for the global automotive market, expanding in particular our range of sensor products to include ultrasonic level, speed and pressure sensors. I would also just note that since acquiring the Advanced Sensors operations just over five years ago, which was our first sensor acquisition, we've significantly expanded our sensor business while broadening our portfolio of high-technology products.  Looking ahead in the automotive market for the first quarter, we expect sales to increase from current levels due primarily to the contributions from SSI. And for the full year 2019, we expect to achieve sales growth in the high single digits, driven by organic growth as well as the contributions from our acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to realize the benefits from our successful automotive business well into the future. The mobile devices market had a great quarter. Sales were 23% of our total in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. And our sales into this market were substantially stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, growing by a very significant 47% as our shipments of products used in smartphones, in particular, strengthened significantly. But we did also realize growth related to laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories.  On a sequential basis, our sales grew a very substantial 34% from what was already a very strong third quarter. For the full year 2018, sales in mobile devices increased by 41%, significantly ahead of our expectations coming into the year. Our growth for the year was driven by higher sales of products used in smartphones and accessories and was offset slightly by declines in the volumes of tablets. I can just tell you how proud I am of our team working in the mobile devices market. They were once again able to capitalize on substantial demand for next-generation high-technology components from our customers, while really executing flawlessly on a very challenging ramp up of production to these high-volume levels that we saw in the quarter.  In addition, our team continues to dynamically adjust their resources in the face of the high level of volatility that we have always grown accustomed to in this market. Based on our significant incremental sales in the fourth quarter that were well beyond expectations, we now expect a sequential decline in sales for the first quarter of approximately 50%. While this is a greater-than-normal seasonal decline, when factoring in the higher-than-expected purchases of our products by customers in the fourth quarter, this seasonal decline is largely similar to what we have seen in prior years.  For the full year 2019, we expect our sales to decline in the mid- to high-teens, also due in part to this excess demand that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Despite this volatility in demand that we're expecting going into the New Year, I can tell you that we remain encouraged by the company's very strong position in the mobile devices market.  Our superior performance in 2018 is just an excellent confirmation that our team's proven ability to capitalize on unexpected opportunities from customers around the mobile device market really remains unrivaled in the industry. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year 2018. Sales increased from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically, as we grew both with equipment manufacturers and service providers around the world. Sequentially, sales in the mobile networks market were down by approximately 4%, due to typical fourth quarter seasonality.  We're particularly pleased that for the full year 2018, our sales grew by 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically, as we were able to capitalize on increased spending by a number of operators around the world.  Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter 2019 sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year 2019, we expect a low single-digit growth in the mobile networks market as operators further increase their spending on next-generation systems. We're very encouraged by our performance in the mobile networks market, which was, in the end, stronger than we had anticipated coming into 2018.  I can just tell you that our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers plan for their next-generation advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. And we believe this creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% also for the full year of 2018. Sales in the fourth quarter were stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, rising a very robust 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically from prior year. And this was really driven by strong growth, in particular, in servers and storage systems, as well as also by improved demand for networking-related products. So really, we saw growth across most of the areas of the IT datacom market.  Sequentially, our sales were down by just 3% from the high levels that we experienced in the third quarter, which was, as I said, better than we had expected coming into the fourth quarter. For the full year 2018, our sales grew by a strong 12% U.S. dollars and 9% organically, another year of excellent performance in this important and dynamic market. The company's strong results are a direct result of our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including, in particular, high speed and power interconnect products. In addition, our team continues to adapt quickly to the changing market environment in IT datacom, in particular, by capitalizing on the emergence of these new generation Web service providers.  Looking ahead, while we anticipate a low double-digit sequential decline from these high demand levels into the first quarter, for the full year 2019, we expect to achieve growth in the low single digits. I can tell you we're very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world are continuing to drive their equipment and networks to reach ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processing power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom through their ongoing development of a wide array of next generation of technologies. And then, finally, the broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 5% of our sales for the full year of 2018. Sales in broadband increased by a bit less than we had expected, 7% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with growth driven by increased spending on network build-outs by our service provider customers. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a greater-than-expected 5% from the third quarter, although the fourth quarter is typically impacted by the winter weather. I would say that 2018 was a challenging year in the broadband market as our sales were slightly down from prior year on an overall pause in operators' spending growth. And as we look into 2019, we expect our sales to remain at these levels, at the current quarterly levels in the first quarter as operator spending remains stable.  And for the full year 2019, we expect sales to be flat with our current 2018 levels. Despite this muted outlook for demand in the broadband market in 2019, we remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. We continue to position the company as the most flexible supplier, thereby, ensuring that Amphenol can benefit should there be any upticks in demand from our customers. So just in summary, I can just tell you I'm extremely proud of the company's performance here in 2018. It was a truly special year for Amphenol, as we passed $8 billion in sales and reached an adjusted return on sales of 20.7%. The Amphenol organization has clearly continued to execute extraordinarily well in this very dynamic marketplace. In particular, our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in the company expanding our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages : our leading technology; our increasing position with customers across a diversified array of end markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; a highly effective acquisition program; and most importantly, the base of it all, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. So now, turning to the outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2019. As both Craig and I have already mentioned, given the incremental and excess demand from the mobile devices market that we experienced in the fourth quarter, we do expect a commensurate reduction in sales in that market, in addition to the traditional seasonal decline that we would typically see. In addition, we would just say that there is clearly a heightened level of uncertainty in the overall market environment and that includes the factors related to the trade policy.  On this basis and based on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2019 the following results : For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1,898,000,000 to $1,938,000,000, and diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.88, respectively. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 2% to 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% to 7% in local currency and an increase versus prior year of adjusted diluted EPS of 4% to 6%. For the full year 2019, we expect sales in the range of $8,190,000,000 to $8,350,000,000, and diluted EPS in the range of $3.88 to $3.96, respectively. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth of flat to 2%, and 3% to 5% over 2018 levels, respectively.  I can just say once more that we're very encouraged by the company's record performance in 2018, and we look forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics around the world. I'm confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our new performance records and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position, while also expanding the company's profitability. And with that, operator, it'd be our pleasure to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes. First question is about mobile devices, which was the significant and positive surprise, especially given how weak global smartphone demand was and a lot of the smartphone supply chain companies actually cut their fourth quarter guidance. So I'm hoping for just a little bit more color on how Amphenol was able to actually achieve significant revenue upside in its mobile devices segment for this past quarter? Richard Norwitt : So well, thanks very much, Mark. I mean, look, we -- our team reacts to what demand we get from our customers. And I think, whether that's come in prior years from sometimes gaining share or sometimes the programs that we're on have done a little bit better, I would tell you that this year, it was more just the volumes of the programs that we were on. There was more demand for the products that we were selling, and that's really the most simple explanation. And I think it really is a credit to our team for being able to react to that volume increase. And as I said, I mean, we had a volume increase in the quarter of quite significance on a sequential basis, 32%, from quarter-to-quarter. And to react to such an increase in volume and be able to satisfy that was really a testament to the team's agility in the face of what is, no doubt about it, the most volatile market that we work in. And look, as I explained in my prepared remarks, we see also the sort of commensurate reduction, which is more significant than we have typically seen, but that was because we saw this real incremental demand that we hadn't expected coming into the quarter. And if you look at this market over many years, we have seen many times where we were not really able to predict quarter-to-quarter what's going to happen. We've seen sometimes a very strong Q2. We've seen other times a strong Q3, and in this case, we saw a really strong Q4. And it's really no different in -- than we've seen in other years. The only difference here is that it kind of crosses the calendar year, and so it has a little bit of a magnified effect on the overall growth outlook for the company calendar year to calendar year. But it's just another reflection of the team's real ability to capture what opportunities are present for them and then to react when, sometimes, the volumes have a different trajectory on the downside. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job of that, ramping up the resources where necessary and ramping them down just as quickly as they need to in the face of the sort of seasonality that comes along. Mark Delaney : That's helpful, Adam. My second question is about SSI. I was hoping to get a better sense where EBIT margins are for that acquisition, what sort of EPS contribution from SSI is assumed in your guidance for 2019? And how should we think about EBIT margins for SSI over the longer term compared to the corporate average? Richard Norwitt : Sure. Thanks a lot, Mark. Yes, with regards to SSI, I think we actually talked about this a little bit also when we released our press release for it. But those EBIT margins for that company, it's a great company, it's just slightly below kind of the company average, not meaningfully below, but they are slightly below the company average. So in terms of the EPS accretion, we didn't really talk about that, and certainly, I wouldn't necessarily point that out specifically, but I'm sure you can probably calculate that yourself based on the EBIT margins I just mentioned. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I have two questions as well, guys. First off, in the mobile device side, Adam, the decline you guys have seen in March, is there a way to think about how much of that do you think is just normal seasonality versus inventory correction at the OEM level? And if you look at your crystal ball for mobile devices, do you think March is a trough, and then it will start the improvement in revenues in June? Or could revenues remain muted for the first half of the year? Richard Norwitt : Well, first, I don't have a good crystal ball on mobile devices, Amit. I think we -- you've covered us long enough to know that. But look, I think what we both said, Craig and I, I mean, we -- the vast majority of our beat in the fourth quarter was really coming from mobile devices. So I would sort of say that the equivalent of that is what we would see as kind of a correction going into the first quarter, because that was really incremental to the plans. And we don't know, ultimately, who's selling what products, but we do have a general sense of what they buy from us. And so beyond that, I think it's the kind of normal seasonality. And look, normally, the first quarter is down somewhere between, I don't know, 25%, 35% is not abnormal to see. You have the holidays. You have Chinese New Year. You have all those various things. Is the first quarter a trough or not? I think that's -- again, I think it's hard to say with a crystal ball. I think we've given an outlook for the year that we would expect the year to be down in the kind of mid- to high-teens. What the cadence is over the course of each quarter, I'm pretty bad at predicting that. So I won't try -- I won't go out at the end of my skis on that one. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And if I could just follow up, you talked about heightened global uncertainty here, I think. I was somewhat surprised how well your military business is doing despite the government shutdown. So are you seeing any impact from that? Or is there a risk that, that starts to impact your military business very specifically from the government shutdown? Any color there would be great. Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, I think, the government shutdown, I mean, it may have lots of impacts that I'm not privy to, but I think the one area that it doesn't seem to have an impact on is the defense industry. I think the DOD is not one of the division -- one of the departments that is impacted today by the government shutdown. I mean, we continue to see very robust demand in the military market. Obviously, we don't sell directly to the government in the vast majority of instances. The vast majority of what we sell is components that get integrated onto advanced military electronics systems, airplanes, vehicles, munition systems, communication systems and the like. And we're selling those to OEMs who are manufacturing those products. But I think, in general, we have not seen really any slowdown or any impact from the government shutdown on our really strong military business. And I think, when you look at the performance of our military business, really, over the course of the year, it's just a really outstanding performance, growing 20%, 19% organically, really continued momentum through the course of the year and, I think, with a continued strong outlook going into 2019. And I think it is a reflection, really, of two things. I mean, number one, we have worked over many, many years to broaden what was already an industry-leading position in military interconnect products, both through our acquisitions as well as really leveraging our technology capabilities around the company and packaging those technologies into the military, areas like high-speed and fiber optics and power. I mean, the sort of core pillars of interconnect technology, we've just -- our teams have done an outstanding job of packaging those for these next-generation advanced military electronics. And the places where you see these electronics going in these next-generation electronics is really amazing. I was just recently out in Michigan, and seeing what they're doing, for example, on next-generation electronification of military hardware, these are these really exciting areas where the military is pushing the limits of these technologies and where our team, by having broadened the range of products that we can sell, really becomes the first phone call on so many of these next-generation systems. And so, I think, look, regardless of whether there's a short-term government shutdown or otherwise, I think this trend towards adoption of new electronics in the military and our enabling of that adoption has a real favorable platform for Amphenol. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, I want to ask my obligatory mobile device question as well. Your volume increase comment around mobile devices, I mean, if you really look at or at least what we track in terms of revisions to smartphone demand, it really had trended negative as you closed out through the course of the quarter. And the bulk of that really happened in November and December. And when you look at sort of your guidance and upside to that, should we be really thinking about mobile devices as much broader than just smartphones? And frankly, laptops had been challenged too because of Intel shortage. So should we be attributing this upside not to smartphones, but really to wearables? And can you size maybe the wearables business within your mobile devices, so we have some context on how large that could be? I have a follow-up. Richard Norwitt : Yes. I know it's not necessarily jibing with what everybody hears. But actually, we had really a strong performance in smartphones in the quarter. We had strong performance in other areas as well. And we do have a strong position in things like wearables. But today, our biggest business in mobile devices is really smartphones. We grew -- I will tell you, we grew in all the areas, whether that's phones or laptops or tablets, wearables, all the other sort of accessories. I mean, there are so many new types of mobile devices that continue to emerge. But we had very strong and really the strongest performance in smartphones. And I think to try to give a little color to that, we've been very successful at enabling with really new technologies, our products that sometimes can be used in new generation phones at a higher level of content and having a higher value into those products. And I think our team's just done a fabulous job of continuing to build on our content as those devices become more complex and as there's more value that can be embedded in them. And you'll know very well, Wamsi, our approach here has always been a very consistent approach. It's one where we say, we will participate in the mobile devices market to the extent that our product is really adding value to the end product of our customer. And as our customer develops products which have more complex hardware, different -- an array of signals that go into them and other things like that, that can create the opportunity for us to participate with more content. It doesn't mean we always win everything. Of course, it's a very volatile market. Everything is a new jump ball. But the opportunity is still there so long as there is still the innovation on the hardware side. As we've said before, if everything turned into a commodity that was just an empty host for software, then probably we wouldn't participate as much. But as long as we've been in this market, we continue to see customers innovating new platforms of hardware and seeing the hardware as a strong selling point to their consumers and as a differentiating point to attract, preserve or gain market share. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. And I was wondering if I could ask a longer-term question around the sensor business. So you obviously alluded to your Advanced Sensors, you did All Sensors, SSI now. Can you maybe size for us the sensor portfolio as it currently stands and how you think about sort of the growth profile of that asset in aggregate, maybe just for 2019 if you could slice it a little differently from some of the end market because it goes across -- cuts across your different end markets? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, I mean, look, we're really pleased with the progress of our sensor business really over the last half decade. It was just over five years ago that we made our first acquisition of the Advanced Sensor Business of GE, really, five years and a month ago, I think, exactly. And since that time, we have acquired, I think, the better part of eight businesses that have been complements to that original Advanced Sensor Business. And without giving a specific number for what sensors represent, because that's not necessarily how we portray the sales of the company, I would tell you that you look at all the acquisitions that we've made, with also some not insubstantial organic growth, and it's become a good business for us. And what we really like about the business, as you alluded to, is it's not just kind of a one-trick pony of a business. You have a lot of different diversified opportunities, predominantly across the industrial and automotive markets, but we've also started to see sensor opportunities in the aerospace market. And we'll continue to look for new areas across Amphenol's entire end market portfolio to really expand our sensor business. And the other thing that we've continued to see is a real strong benefit to us being able to go to customers with a comprehensive offering of interconnect, antennas and sensors. And more and more, whether that's in areas like Internet of Things or whether that's in next-generation connected heavy equipment or you go through the list, there are so many different areas where the opportunity to go to customers and give them really an end-to-end solution has -- becomes more and more compelling. And I think we've seen strong benefits from that, so far, and I think the stronger potential is still really in the future for that proposition. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Just a question regarding, Adam, your commentary on the mobile networks and IT datacom's spaces, both areas where you saw very strong growth. It looks like a little bit more subdued outlook this year. I think you're looking at low single-digit growth for each sector. Could you -- particularly on the IT data center where you've seen good growth, are you seeing any sort of pause, particularly on data center investments? And then on mobile networks, what's your take on the 5G rollout and how that impacts your revenue going forward? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, look, as we mentioned, I think we had really strong both years in both these markets in 2018. You'll remember, we came into 2018 with a little bit less sanguine outlook, in particular in mobile networks, where I think we came into the year, if I recall correctly, almost flat. And IT datacom was kind of a mid-single-digit kind of an outlook, and we ended up in both those markets growing organically in the high single digits. As we look now into 2019 -- look, I talked about the fact that there is -- there has been a little bit of building uncertainty in the world. I think these are coming off a very, very strong year in particular for IT datacom. And so as we think about our outlook for the coming year with some of the -- a little bit of conservatism maybe from some customers in the IT datacom market, given the overall kind of geopolitical world, maybe a little bit of that also in Asia, places like China, I think it's not -- nothing cataclysmic. I think we still see that as being a market where we're going to have growth in the year. And you can bet that our team's going to fight really hard for every opportunity that presents itself. Relative to the mobile networks market, I think we're really pleased to see a little bit more opportunities in 2018. And it remains a market where, I would say, we don't yet see the real strong impact coming from things like 5G or whatever next-generation networks are going to be called. But our team has done a great job of capitalizing on the opportunities that are present. And as we look into the year, to the extent that any of these networks get accelerated, no doubt about it, we'd be present to capitalize upon that. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Adam, just a question on trends by geography. There's been a lot of focus in the investing community on just China's slowdown. Just curious to get your take in terms of what you're seeing in China versus Europe and North America. Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, I mean, I'll say two things. In the fourth quarter, we actually had really strong growth in Asia, not surprising on one -- from one perspective, which is that the mobile devices is essentially all procured in Asia, if not all procured in China. And so when you have a strong mobile devices quarter, that tends to also bring the all of Asia. But interesting what I would also say is that even if you take out mobile devices in the fourth quarter, I mean, we still grew in the kind of mid-single digits in Asia. And for us, the vast majority of our business in Asia is in China. And so I think our team, despite all the sort of press that you read, despite all the hoopla and hue and cry about the trade war and the slowdowns and all of this, I think our team's done a really good job of ferreting out opportunities. But I would also point out that in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter, in Asia, for example, we grew in markets like automotive on a year-over-year basis. And I think that that's a market where there's been a lot of wide discussions around the volumes, which are down. And no doubt about it, the volumes are down. But I think our teams have done a great job of building on a growing position there, taking more position on next-generation electronics, which has allowed the company to offset that more subdued end market demand that has been there. Craig Hettenbach : Appreciate the color. And then just as a quick follow-up, just on SSI. Just as you think about the sensor portfolio you were talking about in half a decade of acquisitions, and you're building that up, can you just talk about the environment in terms of for additional potential bolt-ons and is it specific sensor types that you can kind of expand upon or certain end markets that look more attractive than others? Richard Norwitt : Yes. I mean, I think when we first got into the sensor market five years ago, I remember very well talking about the fact that we viewed the sensor market at that time -- and again, we were kind of neophytes, let's be honest. We viewed the sensor market as having a lot of similarities to the interconnect market of several decades before. And what we saw was a market that is pretty fragmented, let's say, very fragmented : a lot of mom-and-pops, a few companies owned by conglomerates and then a much smaller number of larger, really strong players. And we saw that, and it reminded us very much of the interconnect market and the connector market that we've been a part of for so many years in that it creates an opportunity for one to build through an acquisition strategy of portfolio of products that can be both complementary and ultimately, valuable in their totality to customers. And so as we've thought about that over the years and we've I think successfully executed here on bringing in the better part of eight companies in addition to that first one, we have really viewed that on -- from two perspectives. One is building on our market position in sensors. So really, looking at the various markets that we participate in traditionally, which are very diversified, really kind of every nook and cranny of the electronics industry and trying to sort of plug the hole, so to speak, where we don't yet today have a sensor presence. And then also looking at the types of sensors, starting with things like temperature and pressure, gas and moisture and expanding to areas like position and recently, level sensors, speed sensors and a whole array of different types of sensor technologies. And by sort of thinking on those two trajectories of both end market as well as the sensor types, we're slowly able to build out a more broad presence and -- a more complementary and broad presence to our customers that we've been dealing with for many, many years. And I think that has been a really great strategy. Are we at the end of that strategy? I would say, far from it. I think we're still -- I'd say, five years is pretty early days. We've been in this business, Amphenol, for 87 years. So five is a relatively small proportion of the history of the company. But we still -- I think we have validated, at least for ourselves, the fact that, indeed, there is some -- that opportunity to both grow organically as well as grow through a thoughtful acquisition program.  And that's what we'll continue to pursue, a real thoughtful approach to adding new types of sensors, spreading those -- all of those sensors across new geographies, new applications. And then along the way, really, the most important principle of these acquisitions has been the people side. And I can just tell you, we've brought in fabulous individuals into the company who we probably never would have gotten to know had we not, at one point, said we want to get into the sensor market and expand really what we offer to customers, broaden really the reach of what our interconnect offering is to include sensors. And I'm very thankful that we did that because we have brought a lot of great people into the company. And those -- at the end of the day, those great people create also new platforms for future performance for the company. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Shawn Harrison from Longbow Research. Shawn Harrison : Two questions, if I may. The mobile networks business, in terms of the growth forecast for the year, is there any difference between the three geographies you principally serve in terms of growth rates? And then second, on the M&A environment. When you come into kind of a more uncertain environment historically, do you see the companies that you've been speaking to over the past months and years become more willing to consider selling the business? Or do they begin to pull back a little bit more from considering selling the business? Richard Norwitt : Yes. I think relative to the mobile networks guidance, I mean, what I can tell you is if we look at our performance here in the fourth quarter, I would say that we had stronger performance in North America. We had maybe kind of average performance in Europe and a little bit worse in Asia. And I think when you look at kind of our full year performance for mobile networks, it was -- really, we had probably much stronger performance in North America compared to the other regions, a little bit better, actually, in sort of the rest of the world areas. So as we go into now 2019, I wouldn't -- we don't necessarily guide by region. But I wouldn't expect it to be materially different. I think we still see robust opportunities in North America. I think our team in some of the other regions around the world, places like India and other kind of what we would call sort of rest of the world areas, we see good strength there. We'll be mindful, though, I mean, to the extent that one or another region comes first with a next-generation system, that could all of a sudden drive that region to have a little bit better performance. And sometimes, we've seen that in the past when you've had a new generation system.  Sometimes, it's a little bit of a regional arms race. And again, I don't think we expect that right now. But to the extent that, that materializes over the course of the year, that could skew it. But I wouldn't say that we have necessarily appointed, by region, a sort of an outlook here. Relative to your question about M&A and with the uncertain markets and whether you're talking about the volatility in the equity markets or otherwise, in our experience, this doesn't necessarily change buyer behavior. I mean, we look to buy companies that we work with for a long time. We try to get to know them over a long time period. And sometimes, the gestation of those relationships is not really necessarily related to external factors. And so does that mean that people are more willing or less willing to sell? I think it has depended. I think if you look at our track record over many years and over many cycles, I don't know that there's been necessarily a correlation between economic cycles and our willingness certainly nor our ability to successfully execute on acquisitions. I think we bought companies in good times and bad. I mean, we made -- I remember making my first acquisition as CEO in March of 2009, which was not necessarily the greatest economic environment.  So I think it really depends on the seller. Sellers sell for a lot of reasons. And those aren't necessarily and usually aren't typically driven by the -- either the stock market or the overall macroeconomic environment. But we have a great pipeline. We continue to work that pipeline very hard, and I think we have a great story to tell. The organizational culture of Amphenol really creates such a compelling and attractive destination for the right companies. And I'd say really the right companies, because we make sure we buy companies that have a real entrepreneurial fit with our organization. We look for great people, great products and great market position. And we look to pay reasonable prices for all of that, fair prices, let me say. And I think we were successful in doing that here with SSI, a company that we had courted and dated for quite a long time. And again, we have a great pipeline going forward, and we'll look forward to more acquisitions in the future. And as always, we'll remain very unable to predict the timing specifically of when those are going to come. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Steven Fox : Just two quick questions from me. One, can you just sort of help with your organic growth expectations for auto and industrial for 2019? And then secondly, any thoughts with the full year guidance, how would we think about cash flows versus the cash flow performance you just did? Would the ratios be about the same, better or worse for any reason? Richard Norwitt : Yes. So relative to -- I'll talk about industrial and auto for a second, and then let Craig talk about the -- answer your other question. I think organically, we would expect both industrial and auto to be in the sort of low- to mid-single digits organic growth. So I think in both cases, we said they're high single digits. So a little bit more than half of the growth coming out of M&A and a little bit less than half coming out of organic growth. Craig Lampo : Yes. In regards to our cash flow for 2019, yes, we had a great year in 2018 for cash flow. It certainly -- especially if you kind of take into account the -- some of these additional kind of items that we had. But in regards to 2019, I wouldn't expect anything so different. I think we're going to still have a strong year in 2019. We do a great job of managing our working capital in slower-growth years. Sometimes, that means that working capital is actually a help for you in terms of cash flow. So we certainly would expect that in 2019 to continue to have the cash flow. And our target continues to be long-term operating cash flow in excess of net income, and I certainly wouldn't expect that any different for 2019. Operator : And the next question is coming from the line of Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa Raghavan : A couple from me, too. With regards to your automotive low- to mid-single digits organic growth outlooks, are you able to discuss some of your production assumptions, especially across regions, China, Europe, North America, for example? That will be pretty helpful, especially just given that most companies are lowering their expectations versus third-party data providers. And I have a follow-up. Richard Norwitt : Yes. I mean, we don't look at sort of overall vehicle productions and then extrapolate our outlook. Our outlook is really a bottoms up. We've described this I think before that the way that we come to a forecast is we go out, and we talk our customers, and we make some judgment about what they tell us. And then on the basis of that, we ultimately come with an outlook for the company. And nowhere in that mix is there kind of a presumption of what the market is going to be. And I think others have maybe a better handle on that. It's not something that we necessarily base our outlook on. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. So 0% to 2%, year-on-year growth, that's mostly -- that's probably lower due to your mobile devices. I mean, my math just says, you probably would -- it would be mid-single-digit growth ex mobile devices on revenue growth. The question from me is, with the exception of mobile devices, are you -- are any of your end markets inflecting downwards? Or is it just cycle normalization that you're seeing? I guess where I'm going with that is how do you view the 0% to 2% growth outlook versus double-digit growth that you've printed the last couple of years? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, look, I think one thing, Deepa, I'll credit you for doing good math here. And I think you made a good analysis. Look, I think overall, as we said, and it's no surprise, I don't think we're the only ones to observe this, there's no doubt that there's a little bit more uncertainty in the overall world right now. And for a whole variety of reasons, which I don't mean to extemporaneously talk about here today, I think the newspapers are full to the rim with enough things written there. Are there specific markets that have had an inflection? I think we talked last quarter about the fact that automotive here in the fourth quarter as we finished the year was a little bit weaker than we expected. And then ultimately, it was even a little bit touch weaker than we thought coming into the quarter. So I'd say that, that was -- if we want to talk about an inflection, it was a little bit weaker than we expected coming into the quarter. And we had weakened our outlook going into the quarter. That's one. I would say that if we look at like the industrial market, it's mixed. We've had some markets that continue to be very strong. I think I mentioned the fact that in the quarter, I mean, we saw strong performance from things like rail mass transit, medical and oil and gas, for example, a really strong performance. And then conversely, we saw some other areas that turned a little bit more negative, areas like heavy equipment, factory automation, instrumentation. And those are areas that maybe earlier in the year, we saw a bit more strength coming out of those segments in the industrial market. So are some of those more macro impacts having a little bit of impact on a few of those segments of the industrial market, a little bit more than certainly we thought a couple of quarters ago? I think that's kind of a fair statement. But look, military market and commercial air, we talked about I think we still have a very favorable outlook there. I think I already addressed the IT datacom and mobile networks market to one of your peers' questions. And then the broadband market, I think, is just kind of in a flat situation right now. As for the full year, it was not a great performer, a little bit worse than we had expected. I think that for the quarter coming up, well, while we do expect going into the first quarter, maybe a little bit of year-over-year growth, it's still kind of flat on a sequential basis. And our anticipation is that the market will be roughly flat for the whole year of 2019. Operator : The next question is coming from line of William Stein from SunTrust. William Stein : Two of them, if I can. First, Adam, in the mobile device end market, investors tend to have concerns for component companies that have a lot of exposure there. I think that's typically because of the level of customer concentration and the difficulty in predicting sort of volume ramps across various products. And it gets really to diversification, both among customers and within a customer among their product. I'm wondering if you can comment as to Amphenol's position in that regard today and in particular, relative to your customer and product concentration over the last few years in that end market. Is it getting more concentrated, less concentrated, more diversified? Any help to understanding that, please. Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, look, I mean, I -- the starting point I would say is that it is a concentrated market on a relative basis. So there's only a few players out there, and there's even a smaller few who have a real strong position. And if you look historically, you will see that we did, in fact, have one year, I think it was back in 2015 where we had one customer that kind of peaked over 10%. And I would tell you in 2018, we also had one customer that did peak just over 10%. And it's not inconsistent with the concentration that we've seen in years past. Our presence with each of our customers in the mobile devices market is also very diversified. So you pointed out, there's a lot of different products that are sold by each of those different customers. And our goal in a market that is concentrated like mobile devices is : number one, to make sure that we're as diversified as we can be, given the opportunities in that space; but also, number two, to make sure as a total company, we remain very diversified. And so that's why, for us, it remains very important that you look at the company for the full year and not one of our markets was more than 19% of our sales. I think mobile devices was 17% of our sales for the full year of 2018. That was a little bit more in the fourth quarter, but it was a very heavy first quarter. And I think the fact that we ended up having that one customer peak a little bit over 10% was really because of this incremental demand for our products that we got in the quarter. It was quite incremental to what we had expected as Craig and I have already described a few times here. So I wouldn't say that there's any real change. I mean, I talked earlier to the fact that this is a market that is volatile between the quarters. It's a concentrated market. It's a market where you have to be extraordinarily agile in the face of that inherent volatility in the market. And it's a market that we're very, very pleased to be a part of. And we're very proud of the success of the company over a long time period when many other companies have not been able to be successful because they just were not simply agile enough to manage the variability that comes in that market. It's a very wonderful market if you can be agile. And I think our results here in the fourth quarter and in 2018 are a great reflection of that. And as we go into first quarter, and we have to make the necessary adjustments to the business, I can tell you that our team is already well on their way without even one word from us to make whatever adjustments need to be made in the face of the changing demand environment.  So I certainly wouldn't want to be 100% mobile devices, but I wouldn't want to be 100% in any of our markets. I mean, that's the beauty of our approach to really the electronics industry in the broadest sense is that we believe that it's important for the company to be present everywhere where there are opportunities in this sort of revolution of electronics that is going on over the course of our lives here, yet we don't want to bet on one or another in one of those areas. And so we continue to find that there are opportunities everywhere, that we should be as diversified as possible. And by being diversified, we get access and awareness of the new technologies, but we don't just put all our eggs in one basket. And I think that's true across-the-board in the company, but it's also true here within mobile devices. William Stein : That's helpful. One follow-up, if I can. Just switching gears to the M&A pipeline. I know M&A is very bottoms-up driven at Amphenol, not a top-down thing. And I understand it's not very predictable when you're going to be able to close deals. But is it fair to think about the pipeline of potential acquisition targets that you're looking at is likely skewed away from traditional connector companies today relative to how it's been in the past? And is there anything outside of, let's say, your traditional connectors, antennas and sensors? Is there another category that you might be looking at? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, I think you correctly termed that it's our pipeline -- I mean, bottoms up, I would tell you we're very involved here at headquarters. So I think it's -- I wouldn't say it's a bottoms-up driven process because Craig and I, together with our very small headquarters acquisition team, are extremely involved in every potential acquisition of any size. But look, the ideas for acquisitions certainly percolate around the company. And that's the beauty of having 110-plus general managers and my seven group executives around the world. I mean, they're our greatest sensory network to find these new acquisitions. They know who their great competitors may be. They know some of the products that may be complementary to their own. And that's a great resource, which is a heck of a lot better resource than just waiting for pitch books to show up on our desks from investment bankers. Now look, are we skewing away from Internet? I would say, absolutely not as they interconnect. I mean, we continue to have a pipeline of great interconnect companies. And if you look at our acquisitions, just in the last year, I guess, two of them were sensor companies and two of them were interconnect companies. One of them was really a value-add interconnect. The other one was a really high-technology connector products company, and then the two sensor companies of All Sensors and SSI. I think if you looked into prior years, you'd also see a blend of that. I would rather say that when -- again, over the last five years, when we got into sensors, it opened up a new avenue, a kind of a new platform of acquisitions, but not to the expense of our continued strong drive to find complementary interconnect companies, antenna companies and sensor companies. Now to your question of is there something else out there that we may further extend our portfolio of interconnect companies? There may very well be. But I can tell you this, we are not acquiring companies just to become a holding company of a bunch of unrelated components. I mean, we view this as a very, very strategic drive to be able to offer our customers a broader suite of interconnect under the broadest definition of what that is. And that, in our mind, includes connectors, value-add interconnect products, sensors, antennas and all that is associated therewith. And so we're not going to just go and acquire random companies to add incremental revenue to the company if it doesn't make really strategic sense to how our customers view us as an interconnect partner to them. But are there new areas and accessories or ancillary products that are really part of that family that we could expand into? Yes, for sure, there are. And what those would be is hard for me to tell you at this point. But we'll continue to look to, as I call it, extend really the reach of the interconnect products that we sell to our customers on a broad basis. And we do that -- by the way, it's also organically, not just through the acquisition program, but always looking organically at our own internal innovation and product development to satisfy those needs as well. Operator : The next question was coming from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Jim Suva : A couple of quick questions, one for Craig and one for Adam. Craig, CapEx has been going up over the years, I assume, to support growth. What should we think about for CapEx for 2019? But importantly, are you having discussions with customers due to the new trade wars and political situations of them asking you to physically relocate products? And if so, do we need to build a little more CapEx for that? And then, Adam, for your mobility outlook. I think the worst year or the most challenging year that Amphenol ever had in mobility was like in 2016. Are we looking kind of like that? Or it looks like your severity is even more than that because you were down about 14% this year, and now you're saying kind of mid to high teens decline? Or is that just simply because Q4 was so good? Craig Lampo : Jim, so I would just say in regard to the CapEx, our typical kind of annual spending, as we've talked about before, is in the range of, say, 2% to 4% of sales. We typically, over the longer term, have been closer to a little -- maybe a little over 3%. This year, as you mentioned, we did have clearly some strong growth this year. Organic growth, 14%. In years of that type of growth, we do typically have a little bit higher level of spending. And this year, we're maybe still within that range, but I think slightly under 4% for the year. As we move into 2019, I wouldn't expect anything meaningfully different from that. In terms of a range, I would expect between 3% to 4% of sales. So -- and as it relates to the tariffs and the trade war and potentially moving production, I certainly wouldn't build anything incremental into the plan. I think that, as Adam's talked about before, we're very thoughtful around being very agile in terms of ensuring that we're doing the right things and being thoughtful around whether or not we have to move production or just do different things a little bit differently from a logistics perspective. And -- but I certainly wouldn't, at this point, add anything from that perspective into our capital spending. Richard Norwitt : And Jim, with respect to mobile devices, you have a good historical perspective. In 2016, our sales were down 15%. I think what I said in my prepared remarks is, we do expect in the full year 2019 sales to be down in the kind of mid to high teens. So mid to high teens could imply a little bit worse than the 15% that we had in 2016. But I think you correctly pointed that out and I think, Deepa, also, earlier did the same math, which is that with this incremental sales that we had in the fourth quarter, there is some impact -- some not insignificant impact from that on to the year-over-year comparison in mobile devices as we go forward into 2019. Operator : The next question is coming from the line of Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joseph Giordano : So auto, I think you said 7% organic was your 2018 full year number. Can you kind of parse that out regionally? How do organic look in each of your key regions? Richard Norwitt : Yes. So I think in -- for the full year, organically, on a regional basis, I would say, we had strong performance both in Asia and North America and a bit weaker performance in Europe. I think we were actually in Europe down a bit. And in North America and Asia, both growing on a year-over-year basis in the kind of low double digits, sort of flat -- Europe was a little flat. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then what about orders for like -- for that business on the auto side and for datacom specifically in 4Q? Some of your competitors reported they grew nicely in the quarter revenue, but orders really started to trail off. So I'm curious what your orders in fourth quarter were for auto and for datacom, if you're willing to get into that organically. Richard Norwitt : Yes. I mean, we don't really split out orders by market. But I wouldn't tell you that we saw any sort of dramatic reductions in orders in any of those markets. I mean, you have a little seasonality that sometimes comes. I think that the overall performance of the markets that we both reported in the fourth quarter, as well as how we've guided in the first quarter, is kind of a reflection of the rough magnitude of the order trends in each of those markets. I wouldn't say that there was this sort of real shocking disparity in orders. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then last question from me, like the mobile device outperformance in 4Q versus your initial expectation. I know you've, over the last couple of years, been winning a lot of this kind of white knight business where your flexibilities allowed you to fill holes that existed from others, and I'm just wondering does that -- how does being able to do that kind of carry over to discussions on new platforms as they emerge? Like does it allow you to -- does it position Amphenol in a way that you can price at a premium because they know that they're not going to have to scramble and find a replacement supplier at the end of the day? Richard Norwitt : Well, look, pricing at a premium in the mobile devices market is not the easiest thing in the world. So I wouldn't say that anything ever gives you the right to kind of price at a premium. It's a competitive market, and you got to be lean and mean on your cost. I think, look, a year ago, we talked about the fact that as we came into the second half of 2017, we really were coming to the rescue of our customers in a few instances where some of our peers had kind of fallen down and were not able to satisfy, both technically and capacity-wise, the needs of the customers and we were able really to step in and solve those problems. And I think if we look at our performance this year, I think the strong performance that we've had this year was less related to that dynamic and more related to the fact that our customers do reward you for bailing them out when they need to be bailed out. And I think it doesn't give you a free pass. It doesn't give you a carte blanche or anything like that, but it's part of the mix of considerations that a customer goes through when they decide to whom are they going to award business. And business is not awarded in our industry just on price. It's awarded on reliability. It's awarded on quality. It's awarded on technology. It's awarded on the ability to meet the execution requirements and the volume of the customer and the terms of the arrangement. I mean, there's a whole complex array of considerations that our customers go through before they ultimately decide to whom are they going to work with, number one. And number two, to whom are they ultimately going to award what share of their business going forward. And I think when you have demonstrated consistently as we have over many, many years that we're there for our customers when they need us, well, that is not harmful to that calculus. Is it just positive? Is it the only thing? No. Absolutely not. But it certainly gives you a little extra thumb on the scale in the whole mix of considerations. And so I think when we look at the teams' great work that they did this year, growing more than 40% on a year-over-year basis, clearly, that was not just a reflection of a transactional relationship of 2019. It was on a continuum on a buildup of sort of credibility and the reputation that we built with those customers over a long time period, together with the transactional discussion that you have on every new platform in that very volatile market. Operator : At this time, we no longer have any questions over the phone. Speakers, you may... Richard Norwitt : Well, operator, thank you very much. And I'd like to extend my thanks to all of you for your close attention. And I wish you all a great start to the New Year, and we look forward to speaking with you all again here in a short 90 days. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day. For the recording replay, you may dial 800-489-7545 or 203-369-3806 and use the passcode 7183.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO. And I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Our first quarter of 2019 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $1,959,000,000 and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.87 and $0.89, respectively. Sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency as compared to the first quarter of 2018. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency, sales in the first quarter increased 5%. Sequentially, sales were down 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currency and 14% organically. The sales decline was driven primarily by the anticipated reduction in the mobile devices market. Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprise 5% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 2% in local currency compared to the first quarter of last year. The interconnect business, which comprise 95% of our sales, was up 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency compared to last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Adjusted operating income was $393 million for the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which is down 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the impact of SSI\u2019s slightly lower than company average profitability. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted operating margins are down 90 basis points, which is primarily driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 10.9%, which was down compared to 11.7% in the first quarter of 2017, primarily driven by product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22% in the first quarter of 2019, which was down slightly compared to the 22.1% in the first quarter of last year. This strong performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and, thereby, maximize both growth and profitability in a dynamic market environment. Through the careful fostering of such a culture and the deployment of these strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $30 million, which compares to $25 million last year. As discussed in our prior earnings call, this increase is due to higher average interest rates as a result of the recent bond issuance and the generally higher interest rate environment in addition to higher average debt levels. The company\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was approximately 24.5%, which we expect to maintain this year. This compared to 25.5% in the first quarter of 2018, compares to our prior expectation and guidance of 25%. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises and the tax effect of acquisition-related costs incurred in both periods. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019, including the items just mentioned, was approximately 22.8% compared to 24.4% in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the first quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 4% in the first quarter of the year to $0.87 compared to $0.84 in the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% to $0.89 in the first quarter of 2019 from $0.83 in the first quarter of 2018. Orders for the quarter were $2,003,000,000, which was down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $344 million in the quarter or approximately 125% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.2 billion, $1.7 billion and $797 million, respectively, at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 78 and 55 respectively all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $344 million, along with proceeds from the bond offering of $500 million, borrowings of $268 million from our commercial paper program, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $47 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $306 million net of translation were used primarily to repay the $750 million, 5-year senior note, to fund acquisitions of approximately $399 million, to repurchase approximately $160 million of the Company\u2019s stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $70 million and to fund dividend payments of $69 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock at an average price of approximately $90 under the $2 billion, three-year open market stock repurchase plan. At March 31, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. At the end of the quarter, the company had issued approximately $889 million under its U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. And the Company\u2019s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.6 billion. Total debt at March 31 was approximately $3.6 billion, and net debt was approximately $2.6 billion. In addition, we have adopted the new lease accounting standard, which was effective during the first quarter of 2019. I would note that the new standard had no impact on the income statement or cash flow, and the balance sheet reflects a gross up of approximately $180 million for the right to use asset and the offsetting lease liabilities recorded related to the Company\u2019s outstanding leases. The first quarter 10-Q will include the relevant required disclosure related to this new standard. The first quarter of 2019 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $479 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a brief comment relative to 2019 guidance. Our current guidance reflects a reduction in our expectations for the mobile devices market, resulting in anticipated full year decline of approximately 30% for this market. This compares to our prior expectation of mid to high teens decline. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a moment. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and thanks to everybody for joining our conference call here on a wonderful spring day in Wallingford, Connecticut. As usual, I\u2019m going to highlight our achievements in the quarter and then spend a little bit of time discussing the trends and progress across our diversified served markets. And then I\u2019ll spend a few moments to comment on our outlook for the second quarter and the full year, and then, of course, we\u2019ll have time at the end for questions. With respect to the first quarter, our results in the quarter were stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in both sales and adjusted earnings per share. Sales in the quarter grew 5% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currency, reaching $1,959,000,000 billion and very pleased that sales in the quarter grew organically by 5%. The company also booked just over $2 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of 1.02:1. And our adjusted operating margins were again very strong in the quarter, reaching 20.1%. Finally, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $344 million in the first quarter as Craig described, which is yet another strong reflection of the quality of Amphenol\u2019s earnings. Just have to say with respect to our overall results in the quarter that I\u2019m extremely proud of our team around the world. The results this quarter once again reflect the true value of the discipline and agility of Amphenol\u2019s entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic electronics industry, all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company. Very pleased in the quarter to have completed two new acquisitions, actually just in the last several weeks, which collectively represent $140 million of annualized sales and which we acquired for a total purchase price for approximately $200 million. Aorora, which we completed three weeks ago is a provider of high technology, fine pitch printed circuit board connectors based in Huizhou, China. Aorora has annual sales of approximately $20 million. Aorora\u2019s products are sold into the automotive and IT datacom markets and are incorporated in particular into embedded computing platforms in these areas. The company represents a great complement to our already broad array of connector products for these important markets. Charles Industries, which closed actually just yesterday is a manufacturer of harsh environment, fiber optic and copper interconnect enclosures, sold to service providers in the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Charles is based in Schaumburg, Illinois, and has manufacturing operations around the U.S. and Florida, Illinois and Missouri and the company expects annual sales of approximately $120 million. I can just say that as we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain very confident that the Company\u2019s acquisition program will continue to create great value. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisition opportunities and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now turning to our progress across our served markets, just to reiterate once again, how pleased we are that the company is balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for the company. In particular, no market in the first quarter represented more than 21% of our sales. We believe this diversification helps to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also continuing to expose us to the leading technologies around the interconnect industry, wherever they may arise. Turning first to the military market, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a better than expected 16% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. This growth was very broad based, but it was driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, avionics applications as well as space. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the already very strong fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the second quarter to again increase from these first quarter levels and for the full year 2019, we now expect to achieve mid-teens sales growth in the military market, a stronger performance than we had anticipated coming into the new year. I just have to say how proud I am of our entire team who works in the military market. They continue to leverage our broad and high technology products range, across a wide array of next generation military applications. This position together with the current robust military spending environment has resulted in us expanding our overall position in the military interconnect market. Our upgraded outlook for 2019 is another reflection of this strengthening and we look forward to continuing to enable next generation military electronics for many years into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and in this market as well, our sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, growing 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically, as we continue to grow our design-in position amidst increasing volumes from commercial aircraft manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to moderate somewhat from these levels but, nevertheless, for the full year, we have now raised our expectations to mid- to high single digits sales increase as procurement of our products used in commercial jetliners continues to expand. We remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into such airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come. The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in industrial increased by 10% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 5% organically from prior year. And these increases really were driven by strong organic sales in rail mass transit, medical, heavy equipment and factory automation together with contributions from the SSI acquisition that we completed at the beginning of the first quarter. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 5% as contributions from our SSI offset a slight organic moderation in sales from the fourth quarter, which we had expected. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And for the full year of 2019, we continue to expect high single-digit sales growth resulting from the contributions of our acquisitions together with our organic growth efforts. Just on emphasize that we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s leading position in the industrial, interconnect and sensors market through both our successful acquisition program as well as our organic innovation. We\u2019ve developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. We\u2019re proud of our success thus far, and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were a bit weaker than we had anticipated coming into the quarter with revenues down 2% in U.S. dollars, up 3% in local currencies and down 4% organically from prior year as the contributions from SSI were offset by slower sales, in particular related to moderated demand in Europe. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 2% as the contributions from SSI offset a sequential moderation in sales from the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect our sales to increase modestly from these levels. For the full year 2019, however, we now do expect sales growth in the mid-single digits, which is a slight reduction from our prior expectations due to an overall lower demand outlook from our automotive customers, in particular those based in Europe. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong position in the automotive market. We continue to benefit from our long-term and successful strategy of expanding our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional and hybrid electric vehicles supplied by automakers around the world. In particular, this quarter\u2019s acquisition of Aorora, while relatively small, broadens the range of products we offer for onboard electronics and cars, positioning the company strongly as those new applications continue to proliferate across the automotive electronics market. Mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. As we had expected coming into the first quarter, sales were down by 10% from prior year and by just over 50% from our very strong fourth quarter and as overall customer demand was reduced from the significant levels we experienced in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, we did have some growth in tablets, but that was offset by reductions in demand related to both smartphones and laptops. And as we had discussed last quarter, we do believe some of this quarter\u2019s shortfall in sales was related to incremental demand that we experienced in the fourth quarter. I just want to say how proud I am of our team working in the mobile devices market, just as they managed so successfully the incredible ramp up of demand in the second half of last year, they were able to quickly react to the significant sequential reduction in demand and thereby, protect the financial performance of the company. There is no doubt that the mobile devices market is one of the most volatile segments in the electronics industry and that our team\u2019s agility enables Amphenol to be successful regardless. Now, looking into the second quarter, we expect demand to remain at approximately these first quarter levels and given our latest outlook from customers in the mobile devices market, including changes in product architecture which have reduced content on certain mobile devices. We now expect a more significant full year sales decline than previously thought, with sales down in the 30% range for the full year. This compares to our previous outlook of a mid to high teens decline for 2019. But as always, our team will be poised to capitalize on any incremental demand opportunities that may arise as the year progresses. Despite this volatility in demand that we\u2019re seeing here in 2019, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s outstanding position in the mobile devices market. Our team continues to work diligently on a wide array of next generation mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearable devices and other accessories. And we\u2019re confident that in the long-term, this market will continue to be a positive contributor to Amphenol\u2019s overall performance. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance is better than expected in the quarter with sales increasing by 5% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically. A stronger sales to OEMs were only partially offset by a moderation of demand from wireless service providers. Sequentially, sales were down just slightly from the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate second quarter sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels and for the full year, we now expect to realize low double digit sales growth from prior year, as we benefit from the addition of the Charles Industries acquisition. We\u2019re very encouraged by our continued strong performance in the mobile networks market. Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to expand the company\u2019s position with next generation equipment and networks. And with the addition now of Charles Industries, we\u2019ve significantly broadened our range of products for mobile network operators just as those operators and OEM customers plan for their next generation systems. And we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter grew by a better than expected 11% from prior year, driven by strong performance in networking as well as some growth in servers, but partially offset by a moderation demand for storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales were down by a bit less than expected 6% due to what we normally do see in the first quarter \u2013 normal level of seasonality. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels. And for the full year, we continue to anticipate growth in the low single digits, as the benefits of our acquisitions are offset by a modest moderation of demand that we expect among some customers in the IT market. We\u2019re excited by the benefits of both Charles Industries and the Aorora acquisitions, which bring together added product capabilities to our customers in the IT datacom market. With these new family members, the company\u2019s already strong technology position has become even broader and more robust and we continue to work with customers around the world to drive their equipment and their networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for particularly bandwidth and processor power. Whether in high speed, power, fiber optics or complex value add interconnect assemblies, we offer the broadest range of products for customers in the IT datacom market. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in broadband was a bit softer than expected in the first quarter, with sales declining slightly from prior year and by 7% sequentially. These lower sales levels were related to more modest spending by operators in the broadband market. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase from these levels in the second quarter. However, for the full year 2019, we now expect sales to be slightly down from 2018 levels on an overall softer operator capital spending. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s continually expanding range of products for the broadband market, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. We continue to position Amphenol as the most flexible supplier in the marketplace, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit, should there be any upticks in demand from our customers around the world. In summary, I just want to say, I\u2019m extremely proud of the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter. Our organization clearly continue to execute well in what is very clearly a dynamic marketplace and in particular, given the ongoing uncertainties in the global economy. Our long-term dual pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program has resulted in us expanding our market position, while strengthening the company\u2019s financial performance. Amphenol\u2019s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse markets, a broad worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook and given the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy and in particular, our reduced outlook in mobile devices which I discussed just a few moments ago, and also based on constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.980 billion to $2.020 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.91 to $0.93. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of flat to 2% in U.S. dollars and 2% to 4% in local currency and an increase versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 1% to 3%. For the full year 2019, we now expect sales in the range of $8.130 billion to $8.250 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.80 to $3.86. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS performance of down 1% to up 1% and up 1% to up 2% over 2018 levels respectively. Regardless of the somewhat more muted growth outlook for 2019, I can just tell you that the entire Amphenol team looks forward to driving further strength going forward, even given the many dynamics in the world\u2019s marketplace. I\u2019m confident in the ability of our outstanding management organization to build upon these new performance records across the company and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. And with that operator, we\u2019d be happy to take any questions if there may be. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Hi, thank you. Adam, the mobile device market you characterized that as pretty volatile and we\u2019ve seen that in the past as well. Can you characterize for us the change in the guide over the past quarter? Typically the upside or downside in mobile devices have really come into third or fourth quarter because of volume changes and dynamics of timing of launches of major products. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why this larger change is transpiring so early in the year? And when you talk about architectural changes, I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks, you guys have been very good at working with customers to capitalize on those changes. So what was different about this architectural change and do you view this more as a cyclical issue or more of a structural issue? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Wamsi and appreciate the question. I think your point is very true that when we\u2019ve had that kind of volatility where we\u2019ve been in many cases able to capitalize on demand that has come later in the year, sometimes that has happened when competitors have not been able to satisfy demand or otherwise, I think what I mentioned and what you also alluded to is, we did see here in this quarter as the designs of the products were finalized with our customers, that there were changes to the architecture of some \u2013 of certain products and that ultimately resulted in less content opportunity for the company in those products. And again that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not always that content goes always up with every platform, we\u2019ve talked about that many times that every new system has a slightly different design, a slightly different product overlay to it, different natures of opportunities and content. For us and I think in this case, the customer chose to design slightly different way and that had a negative impact on our outlook. But does it mean that, that this is a kind of a one way ratchet or some permanence to it, absolutely not. I mean, every product gets designed in a slightly different way and I think what we have always said about this market is, we always look for new opportunities to design in our products into new applications and new systems and well, over the long-term, that has been a very favorable trend for us over a very long-term. If you look over a decade, our mobile devices market has averaged growth of more than 8% organically over the last decade because of that long term trend. But in the short-term, that can go up and that can go down and that\u2019s the inherent nature of the volatility of the market. There\u2019s volatility on content, there\u2019s volatility also on volumes as volatility on winners and losers amongst our customers and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve dealt with over many, many years and we\u2019ve been able to build long-term a very, very strong business regardless of that. So as we always do, we always try to update our outlook given what we know in the moment and due to these architectural changes that you mentioned, and that I mentioned earlier, that really drove us to have the outlook that we have produced here today. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks, Adam. Appreciate that color. And as a quick follow-up, when I think about the strong organic growth that you posted in the quarter of 5%, you\u2019re guiding, a little bit softer growth here in the second quarter. But the full year obviously is more challenged from an organic growth perspective. Would you say that as you look across your diversified business base that this delta really is largely attributable to the shortfall in mobile devices and you feel pretty good about sort of the organic trajectory of the rest of the business. And I\u2019ve heard the puts and takes across the various businesses seems like, you still have upside on military and commercial aerospace and some of the other end markets attracting more or less in line. Would this be a fair characterization of that? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair characterization. I mean, as you mentioned, there were puts and takes as there always are across a diversified range of end markets like we have, which is one of the reasons why diversification is such a core pillar of how we run this company. I mentioned earlier that no market was more than 21% of our sales in the quarter, I think, when you look last year also no market was more than that similar level and this has always been with Amphenol a very, very important principle for us that we tried to stay diversified across markets within those markets across customers to the extent one can and across customers across their applications. When you look at the more modest organic growth outlook for the year, the math is pretty straightforward. When you have a market that last year was 17% of our sales down 30%, that has a certain magnification on the overall outlook for organic growth and I think across the other markets we have some markets performing at stronger levels and we have others performing a little bit less robust. But that\u2019s the nature of the business and that\u2019s not any categorical change. The big categorical change here in this in our outlook is in fact the mobile devices. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thanks. Just a question on SSI. Now, it\u2019s just a few months, but just kind of how that\u2019s performing versus expectations and any anecdotes in terms of growth drivers you just see for that business? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Craig. Look, we always love all of our children and we love our new children even better. But I have to tell you, this has been a fabulous acquisition. Craig and I actually just a few weeks back had the opportunity to visit the European operation of SSI, which is in the Czech Republic and just an unbelievable organization of people with fantastic products, great customers and an extremely high technology products. And the business is going really well, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s performing at or above our expectations for the year. And more importantly, whenever you acquire a company that is really a family company and that, that organization has to transition into not being a family member and where the patriarch in this case who was in quite a senior gentleman when he\u2019s retiring at that time and the management team who is all still there is now part of Amphenol. I mean, this is always something that we focus very heavily on. I remember we were there the first day that it closed to welcome them all. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time with them over what has now been the better part of four months and the team has truly embraced, being part of the Amphenol organization and we see an enormous amount of activities ongoing between them and other divisions of Amphenol, hunting for that long-term collaborative value, whether that be with customers with technologies, with cost reductions. I mean, you name it and so, I would say that SSI and the wonderful organization there has embraced our team and vice versa in a way that is actually beyond my expectations and that would lead me to think that long-term the prospects for that business are very good. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, understand there\u2019s puts and takes by the different end markets, but with a book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1, any comments on just kind of the broader environment that you\u2019re seeing out there kind of how customers are reacting to demand and how their view of inventory at the moment? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean if you look at our book-to-bill, it was strong in the quarter. I mean just over $2 billion in bookings. I mean, you can imagine when you go through the puts and takes of the markets and where we\u2019ve kind of upgraded our outlook and vice versa, that the booking, the stronger book-to-bill would probably be in those markets where we\u2019ve had a bit more of an organic upgrade to our outlook. So markets like military, markets like commercial air, in particular where we had strong bookings, but we had very robust bookings really across the company and relative to inventory positions, again, we don\u2019t have great visibility as you know. We have some visibility into the distribution channel and we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary in distribution channel. I guess, I would say that those distributors who are a little more focused on military and aerospace are probably booking at a little bit more aggressive levels. But that\u2019s on the margins, I think by and large we haven\u2019t seen any significant changes or causes for concern in distribution inventory. I think in the other end markets, it\u2019s more anecdotal. We may have seen \u2013 I talked about in the IT market how we did see for example in storage a little bit of weakness and we did see maybe a few pockets there, where there was some inventory that was built-in and there\u2019s some planning around that. But by and large, I would tell you that the overall position again to the extent that we see it, which is a relatively small extent is nothing so notable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you. Adam, you commented on the datacom market growth, but you also talked about some moderation in some of the sub-markets there. Could you elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing specifically in the data center? I know you\u2019ve had a lot of success going directly to the hyperscale cloud providers and I know there\u2019s some noise about some inventory build or lumpiness in those markets. So could you give us some more color there? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, I think what I talked about relative to the sub-markets, we have real strength in networking, we had maybe a little bit less strength in servers and then storage was a bit soft in the quarter. And relative to the hyperscale, and what\u2019s interesting about hyperscale, it is really a service provider model. So we\u2019re very used to service provider businesses. We service a lot of operators in the mobile networks market and the broadband market. We\u2019ve been involved with that mindset of a service provider for many, many, many years as you know well Matt. And there is a certain volatility, a lumpiness as you term it, in the hyperscale market, which is just natural for service providers. I mean, it turns out that when you\u2019re buying product to manufacture other product. You\u2019re essentially in many times you\u2019re kind of keeping a factory busy, making whatever you\u2019re making, networking equipment or servers or something else. But when you\u2019re installing data centers and configuring data centers, there is just a lot of other factors that are at play. You\u2019re constructing sometimes things, in the case of the mobile networks market, sometimes weather has an impact, the same is true in broadband. So there\u2019s a lot of other factors besides just build rates that come into play in that hyperscale and I would also say that you don\u2019t have always as many kind of intermediaries, things like contract manufacturers are involved. And so there can be a little bit more volatility in that space, and I think when we look at our performance this quarter in IT datacom, very, very strong performance, growing by 12% organically actually in the quarter. But our outlook for the second quarter is a more modest outlook and I think, there may be some of what you described that volatility embedded in that outlook. But this is normal, I think it\u2019s not an abnormal thing for an operator driven space. Matt Sheerin : Got it, okay. Thanks a lot, Adam. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Afternoon, everybody. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Shawn. Shawn Harrison : On the mobile networks business, you took up the guide for the year, the expectation for the year. How much of that was organic versus solely the Charles acquisition, particularly given the strength you saw in the first quarter? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I\u2019d say the vast majority of the increase was really the Charles acquisition. But we\u2019ve had \u2013 but there is some strength in that market, that was a bit better than we expected in the first quarter. I mean, look, we\u2019re really excited about just the growing array of products that we have in that area. And so whether that performance is coming from the addition of Charles or organically, I would tell you that we just remain very well positioned as operators and as customers, really start to plan for their next generation networks whatever they want to be called. I mean, I know companies are suing each other over what they call these networks, but let\u2019s say 5G or whatever you want to say here. And I think that the Charles acquisition just brings us an added complement of really sophisticated interconnect enclosures that are used in areas like small cells, in areas like more densified 5G networks and things like that. And so we\u2019re really excited about bring that in. At this moment, it\u2019s a company that we\u2019ve been courting for a long time, it\u2019s a \u2013 it was a family owned company, it\u2019s called Charles Industry because the wonderful gentleman who founded it was a guy named Joe Charles. And Joe, I spoke to him last night is just an outstanding individual with just vision and drive and running \u2013 and that company that he founded 50 years ago. So this is not a fly by night kind of a business either and we\u2019re just so proud to be the kind of adopted new parents of somebody\u2019s baby that they created and it\u2019s just the fact of how that business has developed and their focus on the mobile networks market in a different area of the interconnect world than what we have, is something that we\u2019re just really, really excited about. So, I think we had good strength in the quarter organically. I think that translates into a good outlook organically for the year, and then coupled with Charles, I think it brings us really a more favorable position than we thought we would be in coming into the year. Shawn Harrison : And then as a follow-up on mobile devices, the lower content this year, is that a function of a share loss, where maybe competitors are providing a material type of technology, that just wasn\u2019t something you were focused in on. And how does that play into the kind of 5G knowing, there\u2019ll be more frequencies to the support millimeter wave and that should be, potentially a benefit to Amphenol and its mobile devices business? Adam Norwitt : Yes, just \u2013 I mean first and foremost, this is not a share loss. I mean, sometimes customers design things with different products that they\u2019re either replacing something with, as you said, maybe a different technology or just not integrating the same type of product. They solve the situation maybe on the board or they solve it somewhere else. And so \u2013 or there\u2019s a different functionality that\u2019s embedded into the product. So this was really a change in the available content for us, not a share loss at all. And then related to 5G, who knows, I think is the first answer I would give you, which is who knows ultimately what the products, how they\u2019re going to be designed for 5G. But, we have always benefited from enhanced complexity and devices. And so, to the extent that there is more complexity, more signals being generated, more signals that have to be handled inside a mobile device be that a phone, a tablet, a laptop, a wearable, whatever it may be, that\u2019s usually a good thing for us. I can\u2019t tell you it\u2019s categorically always good at each individual platform or each individual device, but by and large, complexity and added complexity, more signals, more frequencies, in general should be a good trend for Amphenol. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. Adam, I know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the mobility side of things. But, just to kind of help us all, we\u2019re a little bit struggling with it. So maybe one last chance of helping us understand it a little better. It sounds like it was not a competitor undercutting Amphenol on price. You\u2019d mentioned more, it has more to do like available products or available content. Is that because there is like a mix shift down or the newer platforms have less content? Or just trying to figure out about, are the newer smartphones coming out structurally having less content for Amphenol? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Look, Jim, you\u2019re not at all beating a dead horse there. I know it\u2019s a very important topic for everybody. And again, it\u2019s not a question of us losing share. We were not undercut by anybody. That\u2019s not the case. It was just the customer took a different design approach. I mean, we sell antennas, we sell connectors, we sell mechanical devices into these products. And sometimes for example, a customer will take a different approach to an antenna technology, where they\u2019ll reduce the number of antennas or they\u2019ll change the structure of those antennas. That\u2019s the type of dynamic that we were dealing with here and that we are dealing with here. Is it \u2013 and it ultimately does result as you correctly term it in less content available for the company on that given set of platforms. But like I said earlier, this doesn\u2019t mean that, that is a one-time shift till time immemorial. I mean, you all know that last year we benefited greatly from an increase in content opportunity that our team did a fabulous job of capitalizing upon really incredible efforts that the team went through in order to ensure that we could support an extraordinary ramp, 90% increase first half to second half last year, which took a lot of doing and then reacting in turn as they\u2019ve done so successfully here in the first quarter. So this is the nature, as I said earlier, of the volatility of the space. Every product has a little bit of a different design. Each generation can have more or can have less. There can be new competitors, your customer can lose share or gain share. These are all the things that make this market not for the faint of heart, but make us be able to be successful because of that unique agility that our team has. Jim Suva : Okay. Now I finally get it, Adam. Thank you and then a quick follow up\u2026 Adam Norwitt : I\u2019m glad I helped you there, Jim. Jim Suva : Yes, thank you. And a quick follow-up, for your reduction for that segment for the year, is it mostly the reduction, I\u2019m talking about only, is the mostly the reduction due to the design change or like a reduction in overall industry demand from like units being consumed out there in the market? Adam Norwitt : Well, look, I think there it\u2019s \u2013 I think the change that we\u2019re talking about here is mostly due to as I said in my prepared remarks, the sort of architectural change. Is there a little bit less sanguine view of overall volume demand? I think sure, there is a little bit of that as well. Jim Suva : Thank you so much. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa Raghavan : Good afternoon, guys. Couple of questions from me. I will start with the composition of full year revenue guidance. I look at the flat guidance on revenue and trying to assess what the acquisition versus organic growth probably looks like, looks like acquisition is $300 million contribution, up 3% to 4%. ForEx is a bigger headwind now, maybe 2% down and organic growth is maybe 1% to 2% lower on year-on-year basis as well. Does that sound right to you? Just not very sure what\u2019s in your guide. Appreciate any color. Craig Lampo : Sure, Deepa. Actually your math is relatively good on that, and not to go into every detail, but I think that basically we described from a bridge perspective from last year to this year from a revenue growth is pretty much on target. Deepa Raghavan : Thank you. My follow on would be Europe, Adam you talked about weakness in Europe pretty \u2013 but your comments were very specifically rounding around autos being weaker. But just curious if there are any other verticals that have turned softer versus earlier on in the year, can you talk about that. That is a much bigger vertical for you and probably a higher content regional also for you. Thank you very much. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Deepa. No, I think I wouldn\u2019t really mention any of our other markets specifically. The only thing I would say is, there are a few pockets of industrial in Europe, which in some of the industrial segments in Europe are a little bit the tails wagged by the dog of the automotive industry, you\u2019d see once in a while. But again, our overall outlook for industrials still remains as robust as we had talked about coming into the year. So I think within the industrial markets, there have been sort of geographical puts and takes as well, but really where it was most noticed, most obvious was in automotive. Our business is today much more balanced geographically in automotive than it once was. I think you\u2019ll remember well that there was a time when Europe used to be roughly two-thirds of our automotive business and now it\u2019s more balanced. It\u2019s a little bit bigger than the other two regions, which are roughly the same size. But we did see in Europe, a little bit less demand than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. And I think as we look towards the out quarters, our presumption and expectation on the basis of what we\u2019ve heard from our customers is that Europe may still a little bit underperform the other regions. I mean look, a lot of people much smarter than I, and much more knowledgeable than I have written a lot about that and it\u2019s probably the least well kept secret in the industry that European automotive has a little bit softness to it, but we\u2019re not immune to that, I would say. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Two quick questions for me, Adam. On the \u2013 you said that you were able to protect wireless margins by reacting quickly to a downturn. Can you give us a sense, does that mean that margins were flat with where they were before, you just had a degradation with volume. Can you give us a little more color on that? Then I had a follow up. Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean look, does it mean margins were flat? I mean, we don\u2019t talk about it as margins by each of our markets. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think it would be quite a Superman feat to have flat margins with a 50% reduction in volume. I think what we mean by that Craig talks always about the fact of really driving conversion margins both on the upside and the downside. And I think our team just did a fabulous job of managing those conversion margins. Thus, I can imagine many organizations, where if your business effectively falls in half in a 90 day period, you have an enormous amount of stranded fixed costs that I think it\u2019d be hard for most businesses just to make money in such an environment and our team just did an excellent job of managing the conversion margins. But it doesn\u2019t mean that the absolute level of profitability at that 50% lower volume level is the same as it was in the fourth quarter. Steven Fox : That\u2019s helpful, I appreciate that color. And then on the enclosures acquisition, obviously there\u2019s a lot of interconnect areas that you\u2019ve gone into that have added value to the business. When you think about enclosures now, with this acquisition, does it brought in your acquisition lends out any further. Are you thinking more of that other markets for enclosures or is this more of a specific niche that you plan on focusing on? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks. I mean look, this is actually not a new area for us necessarily. I mean, you\u2019ll recall that we\u2019ve made a few other outstanding acquisitions over the recent years, acquired a company called All Systems Broadband and we acquired subsequently a company called Telect. And those companies were really involved in complex interconnect enclosures more for indoor applications, inside data centers, inside telecommunications, indoor applications. And what Charles brings us is a very similar product actually to those that we have acquired before with Telect and All Systems Broadband. But it does that in a harsh environment application. And in particular, what you see more and more as for example in the wireless market, as people move more toward small cells, more densified networks, where there\u2019s a lot more outdoor requirements, that \u2013 there\u2019s just not the place to put things indoors anymore. And you have to have a high technology packaging for those, so that you can get this complex interconnect into the side of the place right near where the tower goes or right where the junction goes to the house or to the tower or to the distribution point. And so Charles has just this very unique high technology harsh environment, interconnect enclosures, which is very complementary to the more data center indoor applications, that we got from Telect. So it\u2019s not that we have a strategy that says, we\u2019re going to go be an enclosure company at all. I mean, this is really high technology interconnect products together with the enclosures that go around that and that really rugged eyes and protect those interconnect products wherever they maybe situated. So it\u2019s really on a continuum. Charles and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the performance and the reception from our customers of both All Systems Broadband and Telect and now together with Charles, we really have a complete offering both indoor and outdoor when customers need those really complex interconnect systems. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I do have two. The first was hoping to get your perspective on the macroeconomic environment specifically in China. There\u2019s been quite an array of data points, some quite weak, others you mean to suggest there are some to see improvement in the China macro economic situation, so hoping to get perspective from Amphenol and what you may be seeing with your orders as it relates to the China region? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re \u2013 we have any different view on China. I think \u2013 you characterized it Mark, it sounds like a pretty fair characterization, but \u2013 which would be by the way the same characterization around the world, I mean, there are some areas of strength and some areas of weakness. I think people talked broadly about Asia and China in particular in automotive and there\u2019s been a lot written about that. I mean, I would say that our performance in Asia was not our strongest region. I highlighted Europe \u2013 I mean, our strongest automotive performance was really in North America in the quarter. But you know, by the same token we had strong performance in IT datacom in Asia and in China as well. So I don\u2019t know that there is one general conclusion. I mean, one thing I will say, Craig and I were there a few weeks ago and there still seems to be a lot of Ferraris and Bugattis driving around Shanghai. So it doesn\u2019t seem like anything is falling totally off of the cliff. Mark Delaney : I understand, that\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up question for Craig on EBIT margins in the second half of the year. It seems like revenue will be down year-over-year given the already discussed mobility dynamic. So, typically that all else equal will help margins. But, I know there are some of these puts and takes volumes overall seem lower. You got some new acquisitions coming in. So maybe just help us think about sort of the puts and takes to EBIT margins for 2H? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Sure, no problem. So, yes, I think if you look at our full year guidance and certainly, the second half of the year is \u2013 will be \u2013 it\u2019s going to be impacting that. Basically what you see is organic reduction, there\u2019s a few puts and takes on that. Number one is obviously the normal range of conversion kind of year-over-year on our organic sales reduction that we talked about a little bit, a point or two is organic sales reduction. But actually that the bigger impact is, I think that if you looked at the range of conversion on that is actually relatively quite low on an implied basis. It\u2019s really the reduction from our EBIT perspective is more impacted by the acquisitions, Charles and SSI and Aorora, collectively are slightly below the company average and that certainly has some impact on, not only the second half but also on the second quarter and even to a certain degree on the first quarter as relates to SSI. So, those are the things that ultimately are impacting the EBIT margin on a year-over-year basis. But, what we do have to say is that I\u2019m extremely proud actually of the team and specifically the mobile device team and as Adam before mentioned being able to really react in an amazing way to this reduction in volume that, they saw number one in the first quarter as it compares to the fourth quarter in addition to the reduction that they\u2019re seeing, kind of just for the full year and to be able to deal with this and protect their margins on the bottom \u2013 on to the bottom line. And I think you infer that ultimately the mobile device market ultimately is a little bit less profitable from a margin perspective than in other markets. But I would say that we never said that as a company, I think as the company average, we said that in all our markets with an expectation perception of broadband really has, in a range of similar margins. So, I wouldn\u2019t say the fact that they\u2019re down 30% really is having an overall impact in the company. But, what I would say is that, if we didn\u2019t do such a good job in terms of the management team in dealing with this reduction, then there could have been a more significant impact and there really is in the margins that we see right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I understand from industry context, there is a growing adoption of 48 volt technology in both datacenter and automotive applications, maybe automotive moving slower but still happening. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s an impact on Amphenol\u2019s business from this trend in particular. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, well, you always have these great insights into tech, which is wonderful to see. Yes, no question, I mean, we\u2019ve been working on 48 volt applications in auto, in data center and other areas. And the underlying driver is just there\u2019s just so much more stuff going on in these systems. And when you get to all the different things, just the typical, say 12 volt in the car, for example, just can\u2019t support it, the network cannot support all these different applications, that are drawing power. And so does that have implications from an interconnect perspective, I think absolutely it does. I think that there any time when you have that kind of generational shift either in power or in bandwidth of data or frequency as it relates to RF. I mean, these are the things that connector companies really live for, is really helping customers to enable those transformations, helping to \u2013 helping your customers to figure out what the ramifications of that are, what the \u2013 how you have to test and validate and secure the systems, so that they\u2019re equally safe as they were in the past. And so, our team around the world as they are on any of these technological evolutions or revolutions, they\u2019re working very closely with a number of customers all over the place. William Stein : Great, thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Bill. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Joseph Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Joe. Joseph Giordano : Hey, so I wanted to just dig in on auto a little bit. I mean, I know you lowered your overall full year expectations, but at the end of the day given this production environment, that\u2019s going to end up looking pretty good versus most who participate in that space. I was curious if you can maybe talk at a high level about, whether it\u2019s regionally \u2013 is the content that you\u2019re doing of both the production, is that fairly balanced regionally? And kind of curious if you can give some color into how that portfolio looks now whether connectors versus sensors versus antennas and is one growing faster than another in terms of content? Is there major variations there that we should be thinking about? Adam Norwitt : Yes, no, I think first of all, I appreciate the comments and we do feel very good about the progress of our automotive business even when we were a little disappointed with the performance in the quarter. We pulled a little bit down the outlook for the year. I mean that does not reflect any disappointment with our progress and position in that marketplace, which is a very, very strong progress and excellent position. On a regional basis, I wouldn\u2019t tell you that there are regional differences in content, because the expansion of content, the sort of revolution of new applications being put into car, things like whether that\u2019s hybrid electric vehicle, whether that\u2019s new drive systems, whether that\u2019s new electronics, new communications systems, new interfaces of passengers, new types of control systems for transmissions, and engines, and braking and all of that. I mean, there\u2019s such an extraordinary array of different things happening in cars. And I don\u2019t think that any one region has a disproportionate adoption, with maybe the only exception I would say is that the China EV market is certainly a more fluid market where there\u2019s a lot more players. And so there\u2019s a lot going on there and our team has done a really excellent job in that space. But in terms of overall content in cars, I don\u2019t personally believe that there is a real differentiation on a regional basis. Relative to our products and you correctly categorized them, interconnect products and sensors and antennas, I think they all are seeing great opportunities. And so, I wouldn\u2019t say again that one of them has a disproportionate progress. I think they\u2019re all playing a role in the enabling of that advanced content in cars, in all the various regions. And we\u2019re just really pleased as we continue to build out the product range for the company and that includes in this quarter, with the acquisition of Aurora, which again, albeit a small company, they make unique products that are used especially in next generation onboard electronics and embedded computing in cars. And I think that, that just adds to what is already and has already become a very broad range of products and very well, you\u2019ve covered the company long enough to see that over the last decade we\u2019ve really built that out, both organically and through acquisitions. And we continue to be on the hunt for next \u2013 the next sort of complementary product across those various product categories to allow us to be more important to our customers, to allow us to participate more strongly in that next generation electronics and that\u2019s what Aurora is an indication of and we\u2019ll continue to drive a strategy that way going forward. Joseph Giordano : Great, and then maybe one kind of basic one on mobile device. I mean, I feel like you\u2019re the first one to say that you kind of have no idea how to model that part of business forward, because of how volatile it can be. But you\u2019ve given what we talked about on the call here, moving your \u2013 moving your target down 30, like if you had a handicap, what\u2019s more likely from that spot. Would it be more likely to move that down further or up further? Do you have a sense for feel there? I mean, last year if I think about it was like, we started that low single digit and ended up 40%. So just kind of thinking of how that \u2013 how we handicap this one? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Look, I\u2019m not a golfer, so I don\u2019t know about handicapping. We have always approached this in a very simple sense, which is we\u2019ve always tried to communicate to our shareholders and to the world the best that we can at the time when we\u2019ve made that communication. And so to tell you right now that we\u2019re going to be better or worse than the 30%, I couldn\u2019t tell you. We think right now that our outlook is \u2013 this is the best outlook that we have at this moment on the basis of all the information that we have. I think that it remains a volatile market and I think our team remains uniquely able to capitalize or deal with the changes as they make up. And that\u2019s the best we can do at this moment and thank goodness, I don\u2019t have to play golf and deal with handicaps. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Please proceed. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you all. We really appreciate everybody\u2019s continued interest and focus in the company and we wish that you all have a pleasant spring and we look forward to speaking to you in the summer. Thanks very much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. I'm here with, together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2019 conference call. Our second quarter 2019 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures, and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $2.015 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.93 and $0.92 respectively. Sales were up 2% in US dollars and up 4% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of 2018. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency sales, sales in the second quarter decreased 1%. Sequentially sales were up 3% in US dollars and in local currency and 1% organically. Bringing down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales was down 19% in US dollars and down 17% local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. The Interconnect business, which comprises 96% of our sales, was up 3% in US dollars and 5% local currencies compared to last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Adjusted operating income was $408 million for the second quarter of '19 and adjusted operating margin was 20.3%, which is down 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of '18. Compared to the first quarter of '19 adjusted operating margins increased 20 basis points. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment margins were 9.7% which was down compared to 13.2% in the second quarter of '18 primarily driven by volume as well as to a lesser extent, product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were a strong 22.2% in the second quarter of '19, which was down slightly compared to 22.4% in the second quarter of last year. This strong performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in the increasingly uncertain market environment. Through the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was approximately $30 million, which compares to $26 million last year. And as discussed in our prior earnings call, this increase is due primarily to higher average interest rates as a result of the first quarter bond issuance and higher average debt levels. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 24.5% for the second quarter of '19 compared to 25.5% in the second quarter of '18. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises and the tax effect of acquisition-related costs incurred in both periods. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of '19 includes the items just mentioned -- including the items just mentioned was approximately 21.3% compared to 24.7% in the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the second quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 2% in the second quarter to $0.93 compared to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2018. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 2% to $0.92 in the second quarter of 2019 from $0.90 in the second quarter of 2018. Orders for the quarter were $2.019 billion which was flat compared to the second quarter of '18 resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $322 million in the second quarter or approximately 114% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts received, receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $815 million respectively at the end of June. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 83, 75 and 53 days, respectively, all within the normal range. The cash flow from operations of $322 million along with borrowings of $400 million from our commercial paper programs, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $66 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $10 million net of translation were used primarily to fund acquisitions of approximately $357 million, to repurchase approximately $249 million of the company's stock, to fund net capital expenditures of $74 million, to fund dividend payments of $69 million and to fund the purchase of minority interest related to a previous acquisition of $21 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of stock, at an average price of approximately $94. Under the $2 billion three-year open market stock repurchase plan. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.23 to $0.25 per share. The increase is effective for payments beginning in October. At June 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the US. At June 30, the company had issued approximately $1.3 billion under its US and Euro commercial paper programs. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Total debt at June 30 was approximately $4 billion and net debt was approximately $3 billion. The second quarter of 2019 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $500 million. From a financial perspective, this was another excellent quarter. Before I turn the call over to Adam, I would like to make a brief comment relative to our 2019 guidance. Our current guidance for the second half of 2019 reflects a significant reduction in our sales expectations for the communications equipment related markets together with a reduced outlook by customers in the industrial and automotive markets. This reduction in organic sales is partially offset by the new acquisitions announced today. Adam will comment further in a moment. I would also note that Amphenol Management team is reacting quickly to this reduction in expected demand by initiating actions to adjust the cost structure of our impacted operations to current demand levels. Our EPS guidance includes the cost of these actions, which are primarily reflected in the third quarter. The EPS guidance also reflects the lower than company average initial operating margins of our new acquisitions. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide an overview of our business -- of the business and comment on our current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Craig and welcome to all of you on our call today. As is customary, I'm going to highlight a few of our achievements here in the second quarter, I'll then talk about our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter and full-year 2019 and of course, we'll have some time at the end for questions-and-answers. As Craig just detailed, our results in the second quarter were within the company's guidance and that's despite a clear increase in market uncertainty that we saw during the quarter. Sales grew by 2% in US dollars and 4% in local currencies, reaching just over $2 billion in fact $2.015 billion. The company booked $2.019 billion in orders representing essentially a book-to-bill of 1 :1 for the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were again very strong in the quarter, reaching 20.3%. Also the company generated healthy operating cash flow $322 million in the second quarter, which is yet again an excellent reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. I'd like to also just note that I am very pleased that the Board of Directors just yesterday approved a 9% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, effective with the October payment. I'm very proud of the Amphenol management team. The results this quarter were just another clear reflection of the agility and discipline of our entrepreneurial organization around the world as we perform well amid both the very dynamic electronics industry and a volatile demand environment, all while driving outstanding operating performance for the company. We are pleased to announce today that we completed four outstanding acquisitions just in the last several weeks, which collectively represent approximately $150 million of annualized sales and which we acquired for a total purchase price of approximately $280 million. First CONEC, which we completed in late June is a provider of high technology connectors for the industrial market with annual sales of approximately $80 million. CONEC is based in Lippstadt, Germany and its products are sold into a wide array of applications in the industrial market, including factory automation, instrumentation and many, many others. This company represents an outstanding complement to our already broad array of interconnect solutions for industrial applications. Kopek, which also closed in late June as a manufacturer of RF passive interconnect components for the broadband market. Kopek's products are sold primarily to Amphenol, as a vendor to us, together with a very small amount of sales to outside customers. The company is based in Hong Kong with manufacturing operations in Shenzhen, China. Bernd Richter, which we completed just here in July, is a manufacturer of leading-edge interconnect assemblies primarily for the medical market with annual sales of approximately $30 million. Based in Wipperfurth, Germany, Bernd Richter's products are sold into a variety of applications for medical equipment made by customers in Europe, as well as in North America. This great company strengthens our already successful medical interconnect products offering, while also improving our position in value add assemblies for the European medical market. And then finally, just last week, late last week in fact, we closed the acquisition of the GJM Group. GJM is a provider of cable assemblies for the automotive market based just outside of Barcelona, Spain [Technical Difficulty] of approximately $40 million, manufacturers cable assemblies for complex applications within passenger vehicles, and represents an excellent complement to our already broad value add offerings for the worldwide automotive market. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to the Amphenol family, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, so far this year, we've already acquired seven great businesses, which collectively represent annualized revenues of approximately $470 million. But even more importantly, we've strengthened the Amphenol, with these new strong management teams, their complementary market positions and the capabilities they offer, thereby, creating platforms for future expansion, as well as performance improvement. No question that our acquisition program clearly remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now before I get into reviewing the details of our performance by end market, I would like to comment on some recent market developments over the last quarter that have impacted our outlook heading into the second half here of 2019. First, following the restrictions that were placed on sales to Huawei by the US government, there has been a significant increase in uncertainty across the communications equipment markets as many customers are grappling with potential changes in China demand. This has resulted in certain customers reducing their outlooks for the second half of 2019. Second, we have -- there has also been a moderation of demand expectations in both the industrial and automotive markets including in both Europe and Asia in particular, as customers no longer expect a step-up in sales in the second half, which they previously had been anticipating. Finally, and no doubt related to these two dynamics, our distributors have also moderated their expectations for demand for our products, reflecting both the reduced end market demand as well as their elevated inventory levels. We have reflected these lower demand levels in our outlook, and I'll discuss the specific impact of these changes in each of the relevant markets in a few moments. But before I do that, I just want to say that I'm very proud of our teams working in these effective markets who are around the world, quickly adjusting their cost, well, equally importantly redeploying their resources to ensure that Amphenol is well positioned regardless of the market environment. And look, I mean, ultimately, this is the ultimate reflection of Amphenolian agility. Now, turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. I would just note that we continue to be very pleased with the value created by the company's balanced and broad end market diversification. In fact, in the second quarter, once again no market represented more than 20% of our sales. Very importantly that market diversification helps to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also serving to expose us to leading technology innovations wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Now starting out with the military market, that market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by a better-than-expected 18% in US dollars and 19% organically. This very strong growth was broad-based, but was driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval applications, avionics, as well as communications equipment. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7%. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the military market in the third quarter to again increase from these second quarter levels. And for the full year 2019, we now expect to achieve high teens sales growth in this very important market. This represents an upgrade to our outlook provided last quarter. I remain extremely proud of Amphenol's team working in the military market. As demand for military interconnect products continues to accelerate, given both the robust government spending levels as well as the acceleration of adoption of new technologies, our organization has done an outstanding job reacting to meet these elevated levels of demand, while also gaining market share. We simply have the broadest range of interconnect products together with the strongest and most international manufacturing footprint and this positions us very strongly for the long term. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in the second quarter came in stronger than expected growing 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically as we capitalized on continued strong demand for next generation jetliners. Sequentially, our sales were down just slightly from the first quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect a slight moderation of sales given typical summer seasonality, but regardless, we now expect a low double-digit increase in sales in the commercial air market for the full-year 2019 and this represents an improvement from our prior expectations. We remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as the next generation systems that are integrated into such airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter were down by 3% in US dollars and 8% organically, as growth in factory automation, industrial battery and medical applications was offset by reductions in heavy equipment instrumentation and alternative energy. Our sales to distribution were also softer on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 2% from the first quarter. We're very excited about the recent additions of both CONEC and Bernd Richter, which strengthen our position in the European industrial market in particular across a range of exciting segments including medical, factory automation, instrumentation and many other applications. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase from the second quarter levels, as we benefit from the additions of our new acquisitions together with modest sequential organic growth. And while we do anticipate growth in the high single digits for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, we now do not expect to grow organically for the full year as both our distributor and OEM customers no longer foresee a step-up in demand in the second half. Regardless of this organic moderation demand that we've recently seen, we remain very encouraged by the company's leading position in the industrial interconnect and sensors market. Through both our successful acquisition program as well as our innovation initiatives, we have developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. We're proud of the success and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were about as expected in the second quarter with sales flat to prior year in US dollars and down 3% organically. This organic moderation of sales was related primarily to the European market and to a lesser extent, in North America. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 4%. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels. And for the full year 2019, we now expect sales growth in the low-single-digits, which is a slight reduction from our prior expectations. As I alluded to earlier, while we came into the second quarter expecting a step-up in demand in the automotive market in the second half, based on our current input from customers, we no longer expect any meaningful organic increase in sales here in the second half of 2019. This relates primarily to subdued vehicle production expectations for Europe and Asia. Regardless of this more muted outlook, for the full year, the Company is positioned in the automotive market is as strong as ever. We continue to work with a wide array of customers around the world to design in our broadening portfolio of interconnect sensor and antenna products into their next-generation vehicles. In addition, we're working on many advanced technologies with customers around the world, including next-generation electrified drivetrains, autonomous driving systems and many others. And with the acquisition of GJM further expanding our product range and customer reach, we believe we've built an excellent base for future performance. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were slightly lower than expected in the second quarter, growing 4% from prior year as growth in smartphones, laptops and wearables was partially offset by a reduction in sales related to tablets and production-related products. Looking into the third quarter, we expect demand to increase moderately from these levels, as customers begin to ramp up their new platforms. And for the full year 2019, we continue to expect to roughly 30% reduction in sales from prior year as we discussed extensively during last quarter's call. As always, our team will remain poised to capitalize on any incremental demand opportunities that may arise as the year progresses. I remain encouraged by Amphenol's position in the mobile devices market. Our team is continuing to work on a wide array of next-generation mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and many other accessories. And we are confident that in the long term, this market will continue to be a positive contributor to the Company's overall performance. Most importantly, our team working in the mobile devices market remains just simply the most agile of reacting to the inevitable changes that occur in this very exciting space, thereby securing both our market position and financial performance. The mobile networks market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance is a bit better than expected in the second quarter with sales increasing by 9% in US dollars and flat organically as we benefited from the contributions from the Charles Industries acquisition that we announced last quarter. On an organic basis, our sales increased to OEMs, but were offset by a continued moderation of demand from wireless service providers. And sequentially, sales grew by a strong 17% from the first quarter with those contributions from Charles. Looking into the third quarter and the second half of 2019, we now anticipate a significant sequential reduction of sales as a result of the dynamics that I addressed earlier in the call. And for the full year 2019, we now expect sales to be flat to prior year in US dollars, but down in the high-single-digits organically as benefits from the Charles acquisition are offset by a moderation in demand from both OEM and operator customers in the second half of 2019. Regardless of this more challenging situation that emerged here in the second quarter, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our mobile networks business. Our leading edge interconnect and antenna solutions have positioned the Company strongly with OEM and operator customers really in all geographies. As those customers plan for 5G and other network upgrades, we look forward to benefiting from our robust position as a partner with those customers. And this creates a significant long-term expansion potential for Amphenol. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. As we had expected coming into the second quarter, sales were slightly down from prior year as growth in networking-related products was more than offset by reductions of sales of products sold into servers and storage hardware. Sequentially, sales were up slightly from the first quarter with the addition of Charles Industries. Looking into the third quarter, we now expect a significant sequential reduction in sales resulting from those dynamics I addressed earlier. And for the full year 2019, we now anticipate a mid-to-high single-digit decline from prior year. Regardless of these current market dynamics, our OEM and service provider customers across the IT Datacom market are continuing to push their systems and networks to higher levels of performance. Our ability to enable this performance through our next-generation high-speed fiber optic, power and other interconnect solutions has enabled Amphenol to be a leader in this market, and we are confident that we will continue in that position into the long term. And then finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter reduced by a greater-than-expected 15% from prior year as spending by operators in the broadband market continued to moderate. On a sequential basis, sales were down by roughly 3%. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels in the third quarter. However, for the full year 2019, we now do expect sales to be down in the high-single-digits from prior year on reduced capital investments by broadband operators. Regardless of this more muted outlook in the broadband market, we remain encouraged by the Company's continually expanding range of products for the broadband market together with our strong position with customers around the world. The acquisition of Kopek, while small, brings in house our capabilities for RF passive interconnect devices and represents yet another strengthening of our product offering. So in summary, I would just say that I'm very pleased actually with the Company's performance in the second quarter, in particular given this heightened level of uncertainty that emerged during the quarter. The Amphenol organization has clearly continued to execute very well in this dynamic marketplace. In particular, our long-term dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our successful acquisition program has resulted in us expanding our market position, while strengthening the Company's financial performance. The Company's superior performance is a direct reflection of Amphenol's distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end-markets, broad worldwide presence, a lean and very flexible cost structure and a highly effective acquisition program, together most importantly with Amphenol's agile entrepreneurial management team. Now turning to our outlook, as I mentioned earlier, we have moderated our outlook in the second half due to the dynamics affecting the communications equipment, industrial and automotive markets, which include as well the effects of reduced demand from our distributors. Based on these factors and considering the heightened level of uncertainty in the overall economy and of course, assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2.000 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. This represents a sales reduction versus prior year of down 6% to down 8% and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 11% to 13%. For the full year 2019, we now expect sales in the range of $7.920 billion to $8.000 billion with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.56 to $3.60. For the full year, this represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS declines of 2% to 3% and 5% to 6% respectively. Regardless of this reduction in our outlook, the Amphenol management team looks forward to driving further strength into the future. Our team is reacting quickly to align costs with the level of demand reflected in this outlook, all while aggressively pursuing a diverse array of growth opportunities. This is the essence of the agile Amphenol in culture as embodied by our outstanding management team, and that team coupled with our deep technology position with customers across our markets and complemented by our successful acquisition program positions the company very strongly for the future. And with that operator, we'd be happy to take any questions if there may be. Operator : Thank you. The question and answer period will now begin. The first question is coming from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon, guys. I have two questions. I guess the first one Adam, when I look at the revenue reduction in the back half of $230 million or so maybe $300 million with the deals factored in, how much of that do you think is really attributed to tariff -- the tariff outlook or the US government putting restrictions on certain Chinese entities kind of things that are driving that versus driven by just lower end demand and things like industrial market that might be a little bit more segregated from that perhaps? Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much. Good afternoon, Amit. I think the way we think about this reduction in the back half is -- roughly two-thirds of that reduction is coming from the communications end markets and -- of that communications end market, I would say you can call it somewhere around half or a little bit more is maybe related to the specific restrictions that were put in place the direct and indirect effects of those and maybe the rest is more, a more broad market and distribution element. And then of the remaining call it roughly third, I would say, that's relatively balanced between industrial and automotive. Amit Daryanani : I guess, Craig, if I hold you toward the end of your comments, you talked about undertaking a swift cost reduction plan. I don't know, you guys normally take these as a one-time charge, so perhaps, help me understand when I think about margins going down in Q3 which implying mid-19%, 80 basis points down sequentially operating margins, that's my mouth. How much of that is really driven by these cost reduction initiatives that -- most companies would call as a one-time, but you're not versus just revenue de-leverage in the model? CraigLampo: Thanks, Amit. As you know, we don't call these types of things out in normal course. So this is something that we do include and we hold ourselves accountable as our General Managers hold themselves accountable for the results. But in regards to the amount. So I'm not going to probably talk about specific amounts. But what I would say is, if you look kind of sequentially kind of our implied conversion, there's a few things that kind of are happening and they -- the acquisitions clearly have some impact from a growth perspective, they're contributing a certain amount and those are contributing. I would say, operating margin lower than the average of the company today and certainly over time, we do expect to get those up, but they will not contribute to the level that we would expect as a normal kind of conversion going into the third quarter. The other thing that's happening is I would -- is these costs related to these restructuring kind of charges that are in these results and I would say that, if you can probably back into that number by effectively understanding that the implied conversion. If you take out those restructuring charges, essentially within our normal range, it's not anything really much different than that. So, if you kind of back into that it would -- you can kind of get to that number, but we really don't want to start calling out charges because we do hold ourselves basically accountable. And then in the fourth quarter, your implied conversion would be pretty strong going into the fourth quarter as we kind of go into that quarter. I guess one other point that I would say is that, if you actually look at our year-over-year kind of implied conversion coming from Q3 of '18 into Q3 of ' 19, what you'd see actually if you take out the impact of those seven acquisitions that we now have that all are effectively in an average under our kind of average operating margin is that you would actually see that we really are also converting on the downside, which quite a significant decline organically in the third quarter, kind of in a normal range. So I have to say the management team really has done a great job of ensuring that the bottom line is protected even while taking certain cost actions that are going to be impacting the bottom line in the third quarter. To ensure that, going forward we really are in a good position from a cost perspective to be able to come out of -- in the current demand environment. Adam Norwitt : And Amit, I would say that maybe one thing here, which really gets to a core part of how we think about running the business. And we've talked about this in the past that in good times, we run the business as if we driving a car with one foot on the gas and one foot on the break and we don't change that mindset when all of a sudden you have reductions in the outlook of the demand. We are continuing to drive with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. And what does that ultimately mean is that these kind of the costs reduction actions are just part of the course. This is a normal type of behavior, that's why we hold ourselves accountable for it, that's why we hold our General Managers accountable for that. When you're growing, you should also grow with the understanding that one day you might have to take certain steps that will be on the other side of growth, where there is a different cycle that comes along and that kind of mindset of driving with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake, really ultimately shows its strength in times like this. There is no doubt. I mean are we happy to have less demand coming from certain of our end markets. Of course, not. That's we much prefer to have everything moving up into the right. But it is part of life, it's part of business and it's part of working in a very dynamic environment that we all operating today. And I think in such an environment, that mindset, that agility, the accountability of the Amphenol management team is really purpose-built for a time period like we are finding ourselves in here right now. And that's why, as Craig says, we feel very, very good about this outlook on a year-over-year basis and we feel very optimistic about how that's going to position the company going forward Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great, thank you for taking my questions. First, you talked about lower outlook at least partly owing to the ban entities. Adam, Is there anything in there that we should read into aside from Huawei and many of your semiconductor peers have talked about discovering that perhaps not all of their products are covered by this ban and being able to ship more and more as the quarter went on. Are you seeing the same dynamic? Adam Norwitt : Well, I think, look, we should also recognize that this is not the first time that the US Department of Commerce has put in place restrictions or put our company on the entities list, this happened number of years ago with ZTE, who is albeit a smaller customer, it was a very similar dynamic. And so, our team knew exactly what we could and couldn't do, and we were very aggressive at complying with the law, which we knew very, very well. And so as many have reported, this is not a ban on shipments by American companies, it's a ban on export of know-how and technology from the United States. And so from that perspective it does not ban one from supporting from outside without the integration of American technology. I would also just point out that as you know very well, we have always taken an approach of supporting our customers. The vast majority of the support of our customers coming in the regions where we -- where those customers are located and that has been an approach that we've taken for many, many years, which has insulated us from some of the trade dynamics is also allowed us to strengthen our position with customers by having local teams in their localities really working with them. And so, when this became the issue this restriction, we have local teams are not reliant upon kind of a matrix organization that relies on American engineers are American know-how in every case. Now all that being said, you can only ship as much of the customer wants to have. And so, there can also be instances when there are such restrictions where they don't necessarily have everything that they need and thus they don't need stuff from you. And so that's a different aspect of that dynamic. But I'm really proud of our team how they've dealt with all of the trade dynamics that we have been facing for now, more than a year. I mean this has been more than a year where there has been turbulence in the trading environment and our team has just done a fabulous job of adjusting in real-time to whatever impediments come along to our business. And again, it gets to what I referred to earlier. We really believe that how our company is organized that unique entrepreneurial approach to management where we have general managers who are fully accountable and we vest in them, the authority we empower them to make really real-time decisions. That structure is really purpose-built for this slightly more dynamic environment that we all find ourselves in. William Stein : Thank you for that. One more if I can. Has the company ever acquired a supplier before as you've announced today and maybe confirm my understanding as a result of the majority of the revenue of that company being derived from Amphenol it's not really a revenue builder for you, but instead a cost reducer as you could take out the stacked margins there. And what it tells us about the company's M&A strategy? I don't think there's any meaningful change here, but I think it's new or at least unusual. Adam Norwitt : Yes, actually it's not the first time we have acquired a supplier, we've done that over the years a few times. Sometimes there were very small supplier, where it was not even meaningful. Other times it was a little bit bigger. I think out of abundance of transparency we talked about, but this company Kopek, which is a great company, it's been a long-term supplier for us. And when you acquire a supplier it's not just that, that kind of margin stack up that you described. I mean our suppliers don't make a lot of margin necessarily with us. So that is not necessarily what you're doing. But what you are doing is, you're taking control of technology, when you feel that, that technology is really core to you. So I can tell you a number of years ago, we acquired a supplier in Malaysia, we acquired another supplier in China years ago, which became really, a real asset for the company from a next generation technological development perspective. And I would say that Kopek, well there is a little bit from the margin, it's not so meaningful, it's really a technology, our ability to shape the technological development by having in that case the real vertical integration. It doesn't mean a change in our acquisition strategy. We are not becoming more or less vertically integrated, we are not shifting toward going out and acquiring ourselves through the supply chain. This is a unique company, creating a unique opportunity for us and one that we felt really made a lot of sense. And I don't think it represents at all a shift in in where we would think about acquiring for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Just Adam, on the knock on effect with the uncertainty around comm equipment and other customers from a demand perspective in China. Any visibility into kind of as the quarter progresses for you or how you're thinking about the back half, like what signals you're looking for that some of this demand might come back into play? Adam Norwitt : I mean look, this is knock on effect, it's a little hard to pin down. But I can tell you, what we saw during the quarter was, well there's been a lot reported about the puts and takes in the trade negotiations, no doubt about it. A restriction that was placed on one of the world's largest, if not the largest communications equipment player, a little bit changed the game. And so I think that our, we have seen customers -- equipment manufacturing customers who have themselves faced more uncertainty in the China market, in particular for whatever reason. I'm not going to get into or try to guess what all the various dynamics at play are. But just let it be said that they have seen more dynamics in that market, which caused some uncertainty for them, which thereby forced them to assess really their demand plans, look at their inventory positions, look at all what they have in terms of their expectations and that has really been the result that we have seen across the communications equipment market. In terms of when does that change, I would say the whole trade dynamic, it's really too early to call. I mean every day, there seems to be a report one way or another. One day, there is a positive, the next day there is a negative. I am certainly not going to be the one who is going to predict when the resolution is, I will be the one to applaud. If there is a resolution, I believe that the world's two largest economies should not be in a trade battle and hopefully that that will be resolved. And I understand there is real issues that are being addressed and I'm very hopeful that those issues will be addressed. But I'm not going to predict neither the timing nor the ultimate resolution of those issues. Craig Hettenbach : And then just second question, the strength in the military market, can you just talk about it. I would expect at some point maybe it decelerates from these levels. But just anything from a program, I know you've talked about before the content increases and things like that, but certainly that's a stand out on the positive side. And if you can give us maybe a little bit more context around some of the drivers you are seeing there? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, we're really pleased and proud of our military business. I mean you know well this business has been a part of Amphenol, for essentially the entire history of the company and even before, because part of it came through even predecessor companies years and years ago. And we have been just the interconnect innovator in the military market. And so, yes today, you have a robust spending environment you also have just an acceleration of the adoption of new technologies. And that's a trend, that technology adoption is a trend, that we've seen really across the applications, whether you're talking about next generation fighter jets, whether you're talking about communication systems, munitions, naval applications, I mean there is without a doubt a clear acceleration of the adoption of technology across the military. As the military looks to get more functionality with less cost, less manpower whatever they're looking to achieve. And no question it's also it's a world geopolitical where there is not a kind of monolithic mission of the military. And thus there is a real diversity of where the spending is happening and not just in the United States, but really in all the regions in which we participate in the military. Will it always grow in the kind of high-teens as we've guided it to go this year, certainly we wouldn't expect it always to grow at that rate. At one point, it will not grow at that rate, but I do believe that when you look at our position in the military market, the breadth of our position, when you look at our track record in particular, this year and last, in being able to satisfy the demands of our customers, which is not an easy task. And when you look ultimately at the long-term plans of the military to adopt next generation technologies, we feel very good about this market for the long-term. Ultimately what that long-term growth rate will be, will there be ups and downs, for sure there will be ups and downs. But I think all of those dynamics that I just addressed give one reason to feel confident for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I -- on comm's infrastructure more in terms of strategic and competitive standpoint, can you help us understand if any of the weakness that you're seeing, you'd attribute to any increased market share challenges and kind of related longer term in comm's infrastructure this reflects how well do you think Amphenol's position in 5G? Because I know some companies are in different parts of the supply chain and maybe see 5G strength earlier than Amphenol would. But just, there's been a few companies I think starting to see some strength from 5G and just wanted to better understand how you think Amphenol is going to fit into the 5G landscape over the longer term? Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Mark. I mean look, I would tell you that absolutely, we are not only preserving our market share but I would expect it to be even more than preserved. We have a fabulous position in the communications infrastructure market, whether that is in the mobile networks market, where 5G is more specifically relevant or in the IT Datacom market in all of the sort of core, whether that's routers or switches or servers or web service providers or whatever that is. We have an outstanding position. We have invested over many years in developing new products. We have made excellent acquisitions, going all the way back even to the FCI acquisition, which ultimately created for us the broadest platform of products, the broadest range of products across really the price performance curve, which enables us not just to be the supplier and the solution provider for the ultra-high end applications, but really to be a one-stop shop for our customers across all the range of applications that they need, and that's on high speed products, that products, fiber optics, and many others, RF as well. Specific to 5G, I would tell you that we have an outstanding design and position. Our teams have been working for many, many years. We have an unique position in that, we have a broad interconnect offering together with an antenna offering both on the infrastructure as well as on the devices, which gives us a unique perspective, a very unique perspective on all the changes that are coming with 5G in terms of how the signals are going to be propagated, what the nature of the 5G architecture is going to be. And we've been working with customers for many years on that. We have seen already some benefit from 5G, I think we've seen some early systems, I mean 5G ready kind of hardware where we are participating. I can tell you one thing that we have seen and should not be surprising. I mean, you look at the mobile networks market in particular, which is the market where there are not so many equipment manufacturers. And when one of those equipment manufacturers ends up kind of in the bull's eye from a geopolitical perspective, it should not be surprising that the operators around the world would take a little bit of a wait-and-see approach to such a dynamic. One -- if one doesn't have to make significant investments in that moment, wouldn't it be a wiser move by such an operator who is really facing significant investments in the long term to sort of see how that all shakes out. And I think we have seen a little bit of that dynamic here with some of our service provider customers in particular where they take a little bit of a wait and see. They know that there is a lot of turbulence, a lot of dynamics in these discussions. And I think people, those who have the luxury to wait and see may do a little bit of that here, but look relative to 5G for the long term, we are very, very well positioned and I would say, uniquely well positioned because of the technologies, the breadth of the technologies that we offer, and we look forward over the long term to participating in that. Mark Delaney : That's helpful, Adam. So my follow-up question is on the topic of inventory destocking and you talked about that in particular in the channel. When your competitors reported this morning, they talked about typically 4 to 6 months in duration when you look back through past cycles. And I know you've been in this -- this is a long time and every cycle is unique and has its own characteristics, but any thoughts from Amphenol to how long you think inventory destocking in the channel may last for? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you, Mark. I mean, I have a hard time to get too specific about this I think. As you say, I take the words out of your mouth. I mean every cycle is a little bit different. I think we are dealing here with not just inventory destocking, but I think there is a change in demand at the end customer that is also there, and how did the distributors ultimately react to that and how long of a time does it take them to manage through that is something that I would be a little hesitant to give a kind of a projection on. But look, I mean our teams are standing ready to capitalize to the extent that there is any uptick in demand. No doubt about it, they will be there ready to do so. And I would just make a point here, which is we see this uncertainty whether that is in the distribution channel, whether that's in the communications infrastructure channel that you alluded to. One thing that we have not seen any slowdown on is the pace of proliferation of electronics, the pace of innovation, the developments that our customers are undergoing. We have not seen at all a slowdown in that activity. To the contrary, I would say that our customers in every one of our markets and -- are working extremely hard to drive innovations that ultimately can satisfy the thirst of the end customers for higher performance in whatever application they maybe desiring two years. And I think that pace, the long-term pace of the proliferation of electronics continues from our perspective to accelerate. And so, yes, they are here. There is some enhanced uncertainty in some of these areas. But I think the long term in terms of this adoption of electronics continues to be very, very healthy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. And hello, Adam and Craig. Question, Adam, just regarding the mobile devices guidance for the quarter and the year. It sounds like you're looking for of some sequential growth in Q3, but sort of backing into your roughly 30% down for the year, it looks like relatively muted back half for mobility relative what we've seen in the last cycle. I know you've talked about demand issues as well as some content issues, but could you drill down a little bit in terms of what you're seeing not just in the smartphone area, but in notebooks and other devices? Adam Norwitt : Sure, Matt. Thanks very much. I mean, I know we talked a lot about this on the last call and I would say that our outlook really hasn't changed in mobile devices, and our views that we talked about last quarter haven't changed. But just to remind, you're correct. I think the second half this year will be relatively muted. It will have a step-up, but it will certainly not be the level of step-up that we experienced last year. And you'll recall, I mean we nearly doubled the business from first half to second half last year, and that makes for a tougher compare going into the second half. I mean all that being said, I'm very pleased that the team we saw actually grow here in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, which is just a testament to our team continuing to fight for every opportunity that may be there. In terms of why that demand changed, again we spoke about that 90 days ago, but it is a combination of architectural changes in certain devices together with some expectation of overall unit volume being down. And I think we see a kind of a sharper year-over-year reduction in smartphones and maybe a more modest change in areas like laptops and tablets and other accessories. And some of the smaller accessories, things like wearables and other accessories, we see even some opportunities for growth this year. I mean, there's more significant reductions that we've seen in the higher-volume products. Matt Sheerin : And you just touched on the previous question regarding the 5G opportunity, not just in mobile networks, but you touched on the mobile devices itself. Could you talk about the content opportunity in next-generation 5G phones versus the legacy phones or older phones? Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean it's -- when we think about mobile devices, we've talked about this for a long time. For us, it's all about the complexity of the hardware and to the extent that the devices themselves as opposed to the software that those devices act as host for. The devices themselves to the extent that they have innovation in them, to the extent that they have added complexity, that's usually a good trend for Amphenol. So as it relates to 5G, there is no question that as phones adopt 5G, that may require the phone manufacturers to add complexity to those devices because they have another signal path associated with it, because you think about it, a 5G phone got to also work on a 4G and a 3G and a 2G network, got to also work in Wi-Fi, got to also have Bluetooth and other connectivity standards associated with it. And so, it is really just an added signal path in a device and many of the architectures that may result in added complexity. I'm not going to say that it's universal because every device is going to have its own unique design associated with it. But clearly having that additional functionality by and large should prove a positive for us amid all the other dynamics that come in mobile devices. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Shawn Harrison with Longbow. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Wanted to just speak on the M&A environment in that big step-up year-to-date in terms of the numbers of acquisitions and -- at very reasonable prices, particularly considering the valuation of large deal win out as we get. But are you seeing more M&A in sellers willing to I guess deal with Amphenol at this point in time or is it just more timing, I know things come and go. But it seems seven deals year-to-date, significant revenue contribution at a good valuation, maybe the macro slowing down means more M&A activity through the back half of the year for you guys. Adam Norwitt : So well, thanks very much, Shawn. I mean I think there is no question that our program, we've -- has accelerated this year. Objectively, we have announced seven new companies to the Amphenol family here in the first half of the year, is that related to the overall market environment? I wouldn't be necessarily so quick to jump to such a conclusion. I mean, I will tell you that the companies that we have so far brought into the Amphenol family this year, there's one thing that we're very, very proud of about these seven acquisitions. Virtually, all of them are family founded, family run companies, where in fact the family members in almost every case except one or two where there was a natural retirement have stayed with Amphenol to continue to run those companies together with their organization. And these companies were not short necessarily courtships. These were companies that we have been developing relationships with over a long time. Sometimes the date of closing is a little bit more luck of the draw than anything because there is a certain time period it takes to incubate those relationships, there is a time period it takes to execute on the mechanics of acquisitions, the negotiations and all that. But I just think it really speaks to the strength of our acquisition model that here we are, seven companies that we have acquired this year, all of them family companies, each unique with a unique advantage from a technology perspective, complementary from a market perspective, really across diversified array of our markets and across diversified geographies. I mean you go back, SSI which was a family owned company, you look at companies like Aurora, which was a family owned company in China, you look at the companies -- I mean these are all just fabulous companies. They're not like Johnny-come-lately. These are not investment vehicles for some one. These were real heart and soul companies of founders. And again, we're just so proud to bring those founders in. The reasonableness of the price, I will tell you, we're not looking to just buy companies on the cheap. We work with these founders over a longtime period, we develop a relationship and we find a meeting of the minds at a price level that ultimately provides fair value to them and ultimately can deliver great returns for Amphenol. And I think this year we've just done an outstanding job of doing so. To the extent are more sellers willing to deal with us and, I would say that, the more acquisitions we make, the more successful we are after the acquisition in bringing those companies into the Amphenol family, allowing them to flourish in our special organizational approach, it does, for sure, strengthen each time incrementally our reputation among sellers. And I can tell you, some of the acquisitions that we announced this quarter, we were not the only one talking to those companies. They had choices for sure. I mean, as you mentioned, I mean, there is a thirst to make acquisitions in the interconnect industry and sometimes that results and also prices that we wouldn't necessarily pay, but these companies all -- we were not the only suitor. And yet, they chose to join into the Amphenol family because they believed in the fact that their companies and our culture would have a wonderful future. And I think as we go forward, I think that reputation will continue to proceed us and will be an asset for the Company for a long time to come. Shawn Harrison : And then as a brief follow-up, Adam, the weakness in the broadband business, is that solely tied to weaker MSO CapEx? Or is there something within the portfolio that Amphenol may be lacking in terms of how the technology is shifting in that field ? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, I would say it's really related to just overall spending. I mean, that market -- in the broadband market at the MSO, I mean, yes, there has been a lot going on in that space, there is a lot of discussions around content, there is a lot of discussions around distribution and our team has a great portfolio of products and we've augmented that here with the Kopek acquisition strengthen that for sure. But really, by and large, what we have seen is that overall spending levels being down as the customers in the broadband market, those MSOs in particular. But not just MSOs also the satellite and telco side of the delivery, they grapple with the sort of changing landscape that is there. Look, ultimately we have a very strong position in that space and it's one that long term we continue to think is a great asset for Amphenol, even if we are seeing incremental weakness there and that has resulted in us downgrading for the year our outlook for the broadband market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa Raghavan : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Question for you. Can you comment on your performance by regions, if able to, North America, China versus Europe? Also with regards to North America and Europe, which are some of the verticals that surprised you versus your plan? China, I guess, we can all make a guess, but how about Europe and North America? And I have a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thank you very much, Deepa. I mean just to comment broadly it should not surprise anyone that with the strength that we saw in military and commercial air that -- which is not a wholly North American business, but it certainly has a strong North American component, that our performance was strongest in North America. From a local currency perspective that was clearly the strongest. I think Asia was maybe the lowest as you alluded to and Europe was sort of in the middle of that. In terms of which verticals or which of our end-markets as we would term them performed in what way on a geographical market. Again, I mean, military was strong in all the geographies where we sell, but it's just a little bit disproportionate to North America. I'd say that in automotive, I alluded to the fact that on an organic basis at least we saw weaker performance in Europe, and then a little bit less week but still some weakness in North America, kind of flattish performance in Asia. And in the mobile networks market, in fact, we saw strength in North America and in fact in Asia, and a little bit weaker in Europe just to pick a few of them for examples. Deepa Raghavan : Just as a follow-up, can you talk about your automotive outlets in China. I mean, what are some of the conversations you're having with your clients in terms of recovery in the region. And if you can also add any commentary on industrial segment outlooks in China. I mean that's one we don't -- we all seem to grapple with, there is some short-cycle weakness, but not necessarily showing up at this point in time, but just curious what are your thoughts on automotive, industrial outlooks in China? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. I mean I think when we look into the second half, there is clearly -- in the automotive market more of a negative sentiment in China than, maybe, there has been. When I say negative sentiment, I really mean there was an expectation that the second half would be a little bit more favorable. And I think customers have really pulled back from that expectation. At this point we see, really in the second half, no real recovery at least expected by our customers. All that being said in the automotive market, again specific to China, there is a lot of great stuff going on. I mean, you look at the innovations that are happening in electric vehicles and other next-generation automotive systems where our Company has done a fabulous job of positioning ourselves. I mean, there is no doubt about it that that is a long-term great platform of growth for the Company. And our position in Asia, in general, and in particular in China, has really strengthened over the recent years. I mean you will certainly recall and others on the phone will recall that our automotive business traditionally was a much more European dominated business, where effectively in the past two-thirds of our business was in Europe, and roughly one-third was in North America and then just a little bit in Asian. And today, the picture of that business is much more balanced across those geographies where maybe Europe is just a touch bigger than the other two and the other two geographies are relatively balanced. And that, I think, gives us exposure to those areas. But when you have a slowdown, like the Chinese market has seen and that's been very, very broadly reported, that now has a little bit more of an impact on us than it would have had in the past. With respect to industrial, I wouldn't say necessarily that we have seen a significant change or moderation of expectations more specifically to China. I think we've probably seen a little bit more of a moderation of industrial outlook in Europe. Together with our distributors where -- for us, industrial has a little bit more of a component of distribution to it than maybe some of our other markets. Obviously, automotive, you don't sell much through distribution to the automotive market. And I think -- so industrial has a little bit different dynamics, I would say, than automotive which is -- seems to be a little bit more Europe and a China story. I mean, you ask about China, and maybe I just make a quick comment here with respect to China. As everybody on the phone knows, I mean our Company has just done a fabulous job over the years of building our position in all geographies and that's a real testament to again how we empower our people worldwide to build their businesses on a local basis. It's no secret that if you read our 10-K, you would see that China last year represented just over 30% of our sales. But I think it's important to take that also in context, which is that the mobile devices market, which last year for us was roughly 17% of our sales is essentially fulfilled almost exclusively in China. And so if you take that out, you're then talking about kind of a low to mid-teens of our sales in China. And that -- some portion of that is for foreign invested companies who are manufacturing products that are sold around the world and some portion of that is for the domestic market. We're really proud of the balance that we have, but it is just important I think to take that China in context. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I'm sorry if I missed this, but would you mind elaborating a little bit on the second half revisions in the IT datacom market. Was it largely in the networking equipment where you saw that, are we revising that down from a IT datacom perspective or was it more broad based with like server storage transmission. Can you give us any color on that? And I've a follow up. Craig. Lampo: Sure. Thanks very much, Wamsi. I mean, I would say that it is not just in networking, it does include in networking, but we have seen really moderated outlooks from customers in networking and servers and in storage. So I wouldn't say that it's confined to that. Our business is a very, very broad business. We are really the interconnect leader in that space. We have a strong position with customers around the world in all those applications together with the Web service providers that have really emerged over the last four, five years as an important channel. And I would just say that, it's probably more an OEM issue than it is necessarily a Web service provider issue, but across the OEMs it's -- I wouldn't say that it's just networking or just servers or just storage, it's really all three of those have some impact. Wamsi Mohan : And then is there any way that you just give us a ballpark on this headwind to margins from M&A versus the cost actions that you're taking the 50-50, the 25-75 some rough estimate of that so that we can think about what the margin contribution from these deals are. And it seems to me that historically, the largest of deals that you did like FCI were dilutive. But more -- I mean at least now in the second half, we're talking about these four deals being somewhat dilutive to margins. And you mentioned sort of multiple suitors. Should we just think that the market now is such that the returns that we're generated prior from acquisitions are no longer or possible in the future. Just given the more competitive M&A interest from your peers. And is it reasonable to think that from here forward no matter, I mean it's any meaningful size of revenue, then that's going to be initially dilutive. Adam Norwitt : No, Wamsi. Look I would actually not say that. I think that when we think about the contribution from our acquisitions, we still feel very, very good about the long-term contribution the returns from those acquisitions. I mean, look, we paid prices ultimately, that were very reasonable prices. But as I said earlier, they were reasonable for the seller and reasonable for the buyer, they were not bid up. I think the point that I was making earlier was that yes, there were in certain cases, not all of them in certain cases multiple suitors but it was really the compelling proposition for those companies to be a part of the Amphenol organization that ultimately was a very, very powerful attraction and not necessarily that we were willing to pay the last penny highest price for every one of those acquisitions. I mean these sellers in particular the family owned companies they deeply care the future of those companies. Is there organizations going to have a future or is it going to get swallowed up into just kind of a big bad matrixed organization where you don't even find it later on. And I think that sort of care that they have for the future of that organization brings to Amphenol, a lot of benefits in \"market for acquisitions.\" We still see fabulous potential in our acquisition program. It's true, I mean these companies have lower margin. I mean they're not dilutive per se, they are accretive to the company from an EPS perspective, no doubt about that. Do they have lower margins? Initially they do, but we have a long-term goal that is already well established with those with the sellers who're remaining with the company that is part of Amphenol, they will over time move those margins up to the company average or maybe better absolutely. That is the conviction that is the mission of all those companies as they join Amphenol. And so I think when Craig was talking about the kind of margin headwind in terms of the lower-than-average margin of these acquisitions, it's not that they are lower-than-average in perpetuity. I mean, our goal is obviously not for that to happen and I think we have a great track record of demonstrating that we can generate excellent returns from these companies and we have a full conviction that will continue to do that for the future. I mean relative to your sort of initial question, I think, Craig, has been pretty clear about the fact that our conversion margins, if you take out the money that we're spending on making some of -- taking some of the actions in light of lower volumes and if you take out the kind of margin -- the below average margins of the acquisitions, we really are performing really well from a sequential and a year-over-year conversion margin basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Just one question from me please. Adam you're seem to constantly be able to find ways to reduce costs during tough times. And I would imagine that every time it's a little bit different. So I was wondering if you could get a little bit color around what you're doing right now and especially since you seem to be accomplishing a lot task for very quickly on across your business units to offset some of these declines. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Steve, I mean look, this is not so much black magic. I mean, I mentioned earlier that the mindset of an Amphenol General Manager is always to drive with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake and I think what that just means is that you scale as it comes. I mean, you build the business, always with the understanding that one day you may have to scale it back and thus you make decisions accordingly. You don't put massive infrastructure that is fixed forever in place, you take a little bit more of a flexible approach, maybe you lease a building instead of you own the building, maybe you buy not always the number one most expensive machine when all the times are good, maybe you buy the machine that is the right machine not always the best machine. When you need people, whether that be salespeople engineers or whoever when you're growing well, sometimes your people work a little bit harder as opposed to just adding in lockstep the number of people that you need. And then when it comes to a time like this, where the demand is certainly lower than you had expected. Well, you're doing the opposite you're adjusting down and you're doing that in a framework of a cost structure that was built with an eye to doing what you're doing on that day. Which is, you knew when you built that cost structure that one day you might have to reduce it. And that makes the job of doing that not nicer. it's not a nice job but it does make it a little bit more readily available to get done without inflicting just real harm to the organization. And I would just also add here that when we take this very seriously, there is nothing any of us like doing less than telling someone they don't have a job. But we do that in a very focused fashion. So we have around the world 110 or let's call it, now 114 operating units inside of Amphenol. We have many that are actually performing very well that are growing that are investing that are doubling down on executing on behalf of their customers and we have others who have some more significant impact because of the nature of the products that they sell, the customers to whom they sell it in the markets that they work in.  And you can imagine that those general managers running those more impacted businesses, they are taking really quick action and that is really tough action; sometimes, it's people. It's working with your vendors to make sure that there is cost reductions. It's sometimes shrinking the footprint of what you have. Sometimes, it's moving something. I mean there -- in Amphenol, everything is fair game. There are no sacred cows, but the ability to do that is actually enabled in the good times, not in the bad times. And I think that's the really important concept from our culture to recognize that those times will come, business cycles will come, the environment that we see right now is not a shock to anybody. I mean, we would like to not have it, but it is what it is and we are fortunate that the mindset of the people was that as we were growing strong in those same businesses, they had an eye that one day this would come and they made decisions accordingly. And look, it is not something we like to do, but it is something that we know how to do. It is something that is really second nature to that in the moment agility of how Amphenol General Manager operates in his or her business every day. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : I just have one question and that is on the restructuring actions that you spoke about today. Typically Amphenol, it's normal like you said one foot on the gas, one foot on the brake and looking forward optimistically, but being careful for the puts and takes that could happen with the economy and customers. With that being said, it seems like in your press release and some of the more commentary on this call, you're talking about restructuring a little bit more. Can you help us understand, is that because this kind of the slowdown in demand happened faster or is there -- are you shifting footprint a little bit more effort than in the past or anything we should kind of think about that because you are a much larger company today than say a decade ago? Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Jim. I mean, I don't know that we're talking about necessarily more. We fairly had a few more questions about it. So it have had and we're trying to be responsive to those questions, but I mean, look, it was this more of a sudden situation, I think there is a portion of what we're seeing here in our outlook. There was a little bit sudden. There was a day where there was a government policy that had a certain impact, and there were some direct and indirect effects that came out of that and that was really in mid-May. So, I think to some extent, there was a little bit of a suddenness to some of the changes in the expectation. But this is not different. You should not think that we're approaching this in a different way than we have in the past. I think the mention of that, as you alluded to in our press release I think and Craig commented already very extensively about that. I mean, it's really just to be transparent with everybody in particular, as one looks at the sequential guidance and the profitability performance thereof. So I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. I mean, we're doing what we always do. This is normal course of business and it's just -- you said it and I've said it two or three times; one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. And look, I will just say one last thing about that, which is when times are good, you say, well, you've got one foot on the gas and one on the brake, you're making decisions to protect yourself going forward. Well, when the demand is also down, we are also aggressively pursuing growth opportunities, very aggressively and that has always been the hallmark of Amphenol through every cycle whether that's the big cycles or small cycles that this does not take our eye off the ball of developing products for customers, supporting customers in every geography and ultimately coming out of any sort of change in demand environment in a stronger position than we had come into it. Operator : And the last question is coming Joseph Giordano with Cowen. Your line is now open. Joseph Giordano : Just given companies globally kind of responding to the trade tensions and potentially like a shift in overall policies and kind of like retooling supply chains, can you talk about how attractive M&A is in other jurisdictions now? Are you like specifically looking at potentially electronics businesses in like Vietnam or places like that where you're seeing increased investment to kind of diversify away from China specifically from some of your customers? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, so I mean I think it's a great question, Joe, and I would just say is the current kind of reordering or however, one wants to call it I mean, I'm not going to try to predict what this environment is. I know there is something going on ultimately, how it's going to turn out is a little bit hard to say. Is it changing our appetite or focus on M&A, I would say, no it's not. I mean, we've been -- we've always had cast a very, very wide net in our acquisition program. So I wouldn't say that this is causing us to go look at buying companies in Vietnam or going someplace else or diverting our focus away from China, but I would say this, there is something going on in the world. And I'll let much smarter people than me right about it and talk about it. Whatever it is, if it's a reordering, if it's a sort of a reversion back from globalization toward localization I mean, whatever it is, again, not really my place to get into the mix of talking about that, what I can tell you is our organization is really a purpose-built to deal with regardless. I mean, over the last number of decades the way that we have approached building the business out around the world has been to put empowerment behind General Managers around the world enabling them. That build comprehensive organization, local organization who can really adapt in real time to both the markets that they serve to the customers that they work with, to the competitors that they face and to the geographies in which they operate. And I think that unique tailor-made approach has worked extremely well in an environment where the world has been embracing let's say globalization. If that changes, it's still a purpose-built organizations, because it is so localized, because we have not dispatched dozens or even 100s of ex-patriots around the world, planted American flags everywhere that we go and said, here come buy from us because we are American no, no, far from it. We say work with us because we are local, work with us because we are the same as you, we are from the same country, we are speaking the same language, we are developing products that you need not that some other country thinks that you need. And so if the world does in fact change tack here, which it may or may not, I can tell you that the Amphenol organization stands ready to embrace whichever way that it goes. And I think that the diversity of our business serves so well in a time like this. We will never run away from the fact that we are headquartered in the United States and we're proud to be an American company, prouder than you can imagine. At the same time, we're very proud to be in Germany, we're very proud to be in Macedonia, we're very proud to be in India, we're very proud to be in China, wherever we operate and we operate as a global company who is really functioning as a local leader in every place where we go. And the diversity of the span, the business, a business where, and I can tell you aside from one customer who we spoke about last year in the mobile devices market where we didn't have a customer that represented more than 3% of our sales last year. I mean this is a broad and balanced business in all geographies and whatever comes our way in this dynamic that you alluded to, I can tell you that the Amphenol organization stands ready to prosper and take advantage of that for the future. Operator : Speakers, that was our last question. Adam Norwitt : Very good. Well, again, I appreciate everybody taking that extra bit of time today to join us on the call. I wish you all a wonderful summer. I hope you get a little bit of time to rest and be back with your families. And we look forward to getting back together with you here in 90 days. Thanks so much. Bye-Bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. And have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter. And then, Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $2.101 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.92 and $0.95 respectively. Sales were down 1% in US dollars and flat in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2018. And from an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the third quarter decreased 6%. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in US dollars, 5% in local currencies and 3% organically.  Breaking down sales into our two segments. Our cable business, which comprised 5% of our sales, was down 9% in US dollars and down 8% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. The interconnect business, which comprised 95% of our sales, was down 1% in US dollars and flat in local currencies compared to last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Adjusted operating income was $414 million for the third quarter of 2019. And adjusted operating margin was 19.7%, which is down 120 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2018. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, adjusted operating margins decreased 60 basis points. From a segment standpoint, in the cable segment, margins were 10.2%, which was down compared to the 13.1% in the third quarter of 2018, primarily driven by volume as well as, to a lesser extent, product mix. In the interconnect segment, margins were 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019, which was down compared to 22.7% in the third quarter of last year. This reduction was primarily driven by a relatively normal downside conversion, together with the impact of the cost of the restructuring actions taken in the quarter, as well as the contribution from acquisitions, which are currently operating at a profitability level below the company average. This quarter's performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance, action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in an uncertain market environment. Through the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter remained at approximately $30 million and compares to $25 million in the third quarter of last year. As discussed in our prior earnings calls, this increase is due primarily to higher average interest rates as a result of the first quarter bond issuance and higher average debt levels. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 24.5% for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 25.5% in the third quarter of 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as well as the tax effect of the refinancing-related costs associated with the tender offer in the third quarter of 2019.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019, including the items just mentioned, was approximately 24.5% compared to 23.8% in the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2019. On a GAAP basis, our diluted EPS declined by 9% in the third quarter to $0.92 compared to $1.01 in the third quarter 2018. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 4% to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019 from $0.99 in the third quarter of 2018. Orders for the quarter were $2.091 billion, which was down 1% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $412 million in the third quarter or approximately 142% of adjusted net income. This was a very strong result. Net of capital spending of $71 million, our free cash flow was $341 million or 117% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $831 million respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 52 days respectively, all within our normal range. I would note that we are very pleased with the meaningful improvement in net working capital days compared to June. The cash flow from operations of $412 million, along with proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $900 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $33 million and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $13 million net of translation were used primarily to repay approximately $532 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs and other facilities, redeem approximately $373 million in senior notes, repurchase approximately $150 million of the company's stock, fund acquisitions of approximately $135 million, fund net capital expenditures of $71 million and fund dividend payments of $68 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $88 under the $2 billion three-year open stock repurchase plan. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were approximately $987 million, the majority of which is held outside of the US. As previously announced on September 4, the company launched a $900 million US bond offering, which has a 10-year term and bears interest at 2.8%. In conjunction with the US senior note issuance on September 11, the company also tendered $147 million of its $375 million 3.125% US senior notes and $205 million of its $500 million 4% US senior notes. The company used proceeds from the note issuance to fund the tender offer, with the remaining funds being used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of the borrowings under the US commercial paper program. This issuance and tender offer further strengthened our capital structure by extending our average debt maturities by approximately two years, while keeping our average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings unchanged. At September 30, after giving effect to the new bond offering, the company had issued approximately $754 million under its US and Euro commercial paper programs. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $2.7 billion. Total debt at September 30 was approximately $3.9 billion and net debt was approximately $3 billion. The third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $501 million. In summary, this was a very strong quarter for the company financially, especially in light of moderating demand and continued uncertainty across global markets. I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. Thanks so much for spending a few of your precious minutes with us today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter. I'll then discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. Finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2019 and, of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end. Our results in the third quarter exceeded the high end of the company's guidance in both sales and earnings per share, and that was despite continued elevated levels of uncertainty in the marketplace. Sales declined by 1% in US dollars and were flat in local currencies, reaching just over $2.1 billion. Sales in the quarter were down by 6% organically. Company booked just under $2.1 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of also just under 1 :1. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter reached $0.95, which while down 4% from prior year was $0.07 above the high end of our guidance that we gave at the end of last quarter.  Operating margins in the quarter were 19.7% and did come in a bit stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. Craig mentioned that the company generated very strong operating and free cash flow of $412 million and $341 million, respectively, in the quarter. I just want to emphasize that this is a great reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. In what's clearly a challenging market environment, we performed very well this quarter. And these excellent results are another clear reflection of the agility and discipline of our entrepreneurial organization around the world. We're very pleased to have completed two additional acquisitions just here at the end of the quarter, which together represent approximately $60 million in annual sales and which we acquired for a collective purchase price of approximately $87 million. First, Cablescan. It's a manufacturer of high technology cable assemblies for the military aerospace market. Based in Yorkshire in the UK, Cablescan's products are sold into a range of military aerospace applications, including in particular land vehicles and aviation. And this company represents an outstanding complement to our already broad array of value-add interconnect solutions for the important military and commercial aerospace markets. XGiga is a manufacturer of active fiber optic interconnect products for the global communications markets. And this company, which is based in Shenzhen, China, broadens our product offering and strengthens our already industry-leading offering of high-speed interconnect products for the communications infrastructure market. So, as we welcome these outstanding new teams to the Amphenol family, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. We have now acquired nine great businesses so far here in 2019 and these excellent companies collectively represent annualized revenues of approximately $530 million and, more importantly, they have strengthened Amphenol across nearly all of our end markets with their entrepreneurial management teams, their high technology product offerings and their complementary market positions. Most importantly, though, these new family members create additional platforms for future expansion and performance improvement in the company. We're pleased that our acquisition program remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we continue to be very encouraged by the value created by the company's balanced and broad end market diversification. Once again, in the third quarter, no market represented more than 20% of our sales. And very importantly, this diversification helps to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while all the while exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. So, turning first to the military market. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a better-than-expected and very strong 26% in both US dollars and organically. This strong growth was very broad based, but was driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval applications, aviation and communications equipment. Sequentially, our sales increased by a very strong 9% in what is normally a seasonally more moderate quarter. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the fourth quarter to again increase modestly from these third quarter levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now expect to achieve sales growth in the military market of just above 20%. This improved outlook reflects our team's excellent execution in the face of higher demand from customers across the defense market. I remain extremely proud of Amphenol's team working in the military market. With strong demand that's being driven by both robust defense spending, together with accelerating adoption of new technologies, our organization has simply done an outstanding job reacting to satisfy that demand, while also expanding our overall market position. The addition of Cablescan this quarter further strengthens our already strong value-add interconnect offering for a wide array of harsh environment applications. And our broadened range of interconnect products, together with the strongest and most international manufacturing footprint, positions us very strongly for the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in commercial air were also stronger than expected, growing 15% in US dollars and 16% organically as we capitalized on continued strong demand for next generation jetliners with high electronics content. Sequentially, our sales were up slightly from the second quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these levels. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect a low double-digit increase in sales from prior year. The commercial air market continues to represent a significant opportunity for the future in Amphenol. Our customers are implementing new technologies on existing and next generation jetliner platforms, which creates increased demand for our high technology products. We look forward to benefiting from that favorable trend for many years to come. The industrial market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter increased by a less-than-expected 4% in US dollars and were down by 6% organically as growth in oil and gas and medical applications was more than offset by reductions in heavy equipment, instrumentation and battery-related products. On a sequential basis, our sales did increase by 2% from the second quarter as the contributions from the CONEC and Bernd Richter acquisitions that we announced last quarter were offset in part by slowing demand in the industrial market, and that demand was slowing in particular in Europe. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to further moderate from current levels due to slowing demand, especially in Europe. And for the full year of 2019, we now expect growth in the low-single digits, and this represents a modest reduction from our prior expectations. This slowdown is related to reduced demand outlooks from both our distributor and OEM customers. Regardless of this further erosion of demand that we're now seeing, we remain very encouraged by the company's leading position in the industrial market. Through both our successful acquisition program as well as our organic initiatives, we have developed a very broad array of interconnect, sensor and antenna products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. We're proud of the success and look forward to continuing to realize the benefits of our efforts in the industrial market into the future. The automotive markets represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the automotive market were roughly as expected in the third quarter with sales increasing from prior year by 4% in US dollars, but down 2% organically. The organic moderation of sales was related to both the European and North American markets. Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased slightly as the addition of GJM last quarter was offset by a moderation of demand from European automakers in particular. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a slight decrease in sales from these levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now expect sales to be up only slightly from prior year.  Regardless of the less favorable demand environment in the automotive market this year, I will just tell you that our position in this important market is as strong as ever.  Customers around the world are continuing to design their new vehicle platforms with a wide array of electronic functionality, and we're working aggressively with those customers to design in our broadening portfolio of interconnect, sensor and antenna products on to their next generation vehicles. In addition, we continued to work on a wide array of advanced vehicle technologies, including next-generation electrified drivetrains, autonomous driving systems and many others. The mobile device market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter and our sales were much better than expected in the third quarter, growing a very strong 32% sequentially from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down, although by a less-than-expected 21%, as growth in tablets and wearables was more than offset by lower sales related to smartphones and laptops. Looking into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to moderate from these levels. For the full-year 2019, however, we now expect the sales reduction in the mid-20% range, which is an improvement from our prior guidance of an approximately 30% reduction from prior year.  This upgrade in our outlook is related to increased demand for our antenna, connector and mechanism products that have been designed in to new mobile platforms. And I can say that, as we drive toward the end of the year, our team will for sure remain poised as always to capitalize on any additional incremental demand opportunities that may arise. I remain encouraged by our position in the mobile devices market. Our team is working on a wide array of next generation mobile devices, including smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearables and many, many other accessories. And we're confident that, in the long term, this market will continue to be a positive contributor to the company's overall performance. Most importantly, though, our exceptional team remains the most agile, reacting to the inevitable changes that occur in the mobile devices market, which allows us to thereby secure both our market position as well as the company's financial performance. The mobile networks market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our performance was a bit better than expected in the third quarter, with sales decreasing only slightly in US dollars and flat in local currencies. On an organic basis, our sales declined by 12% as the impact of the restrictions put on certain Chinese entities that we discussed last quarter more than offset growth that we did see with service providers in the quarter. Sequentially, sales were down by 10% from the second quarter, largely related to the same dynamics that we discussed extensively last quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further reduction of sales in the mobile networks market. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect sales to be flat to prior year in US dollars, but down in the high-single digits organically as benefits from our acquisitions are offset by a moderation in demand from both OEM and operator customers. Regardless of the more challenging market environment here in 2019, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our mobile networks business. Our leading-edge interconnect and antenna solutions have positioned the company strongly with both equipment manufacturers and operator customers around the world.  As those customers plan for 5G and other network upgrades, we look forward to benefiting from our robust position as their partner. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down by a bit less-than-expected 9% in US dollars and 13% organically, with reductions in products sold into networking servers and storage hardware. Sequentially, our sales were down only slightly from the second quarter as demand from OEMs exceeded our reduced expectations that we had coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels. And for the full-year 2019, we now anticipate a decline in the low-single digits from prior year, and this represents a modest upgrade from our guidance that we discussed last quarter.  Amidst all of these current market dynamics, our OEM and service provider customers across the IT datacom market are continuing to push their systems and networks to ever-higher levels of performance. Our ability to enable such performance through our next-generation, high-speed, fiber optic, power and other interconnect solutions has allowed Amphenol to be a leader in this market, and we're confident that we will continue to maintain that position over the long term. The addition of XGiga this quarter significantly strengthens our offering for high-speed applications, adding active fiber optic interconnect to our already strong passive fiber optic and high-speed copper solution. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter grew by 11% sequentially, which was a bit better than we had expected.  Compared to prior year, our sales declined by 5% as spending by broadband operators, essentially in all geographies, continued to moderate. Looking ahead, we expect sales to moderate seasonally in the fourth quarter. And for the full-year 2019, we continue to expect sales to be down in the high-single digits from prior year on reduced investments by broadband operators. Irrespective of this continued muted outlook in the broadband market, we remain encouraged by the company's still expanding range of products for this market which, together with our deep relationships with customers around the world, positions Amphenol for future success. So, in summary, with respect to the third quarter, I just want to say that I'm very pleased with the company's performance in the quarter, especially given the high degree of uncertainty that remains in the world economy. While we had come into this quarter with a more muted outlook, we were able to outperform those levels through excellent execution by our teams around the world. The Amphenol organization has clearly continued to perform well in this very dynamic marketplace. And in particular, our long-term approach of growing both organically and through our successful acquisition program has resulted in us expanding our market position, while strengthening the company's financial performance. And that superior financial performance is a direct reflection of the company's distinct competitive advantages. Our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our broad worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, our highly effective acquisition program and, most importantly, our agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year, considering the heightened level of uncertainty in the overall economy and, of course, assuming, as always, constant exchange rates, we now expect the following results. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.89 to $0.91. This represents a sales reduction versus prior year of 10% to 12% and a decrease versus prior-year adjusted diluted EPS of 13% to 15%. For the full-year 2019, we now expect sales in the range of $8.035 billion to $8.075 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.67. For the full year, this new guidance represents sales and adjusted diluted EPS declines of 2% and 3%, respectively. Regardless of this year's more challenging market environment, I just want to assure you that the Amphenol management team looks forward to driving strong results into the future. Our team is aggressively pursuing a diverse array of growth opportunities, while reacting quickly to align costs with current levels of demand. This is the essence of the agile Amphenolian culture as embodied by that outstanding organization. And it is that team, coupled with our deep technology position with customers across our markets and complemented by our successful acquisition program, that positions the company very strongly for the long term. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I have two quick ones. One is just on the guidance. You're not rolling forward the entire beat in 3Q into the full year for revenues. And I hear your commentary about the cautious backdrop macroeconomically, but can you bridge that delta, given the fact that there's a $120 million upside in the quarter relative to the midpoint of your guidance, but $80 million sort of flow through. So, that delta of $40 million, did you see some pull forward in the quarter or was it some other dynamic? And I have a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Wamsi, you've done good math here. I would just point out a couple of factors. Number one, currency is a drag in this guidance compared to prior guidance, and not insignificant. I think somewhere to the tune of about 30-plus-million dollars of currency impact. We did have the positive impact of the acquisitions. I think as well, we talked about all the given markets. I won't go into each of the markets. I think I already spent a long time to discuss those. But we feel very good about this guidance in its totality. When you think about the strength here across many of our markets compared to what we saw last time, I think this is a very strong guidance. The other thing I would just point out is that we had a higher-than-expected mobile devices results in the third quarter. And I think some of that came a little bit earlier than we would have expected, and it doesn't necessarily represent a full-year increase. I think some of that is higher for the year and that's why we've talked about the year being down in the kind of mid-20s instead of 30%. But the strength that we saw here in the quarter, some portion of that may have also come out of the fourth quarter. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Adam. And as a quick follow-up on your comments on mobile devices, can you give us some color on whether the incremental strength you saw was more on the variable side or on the mobile phone side? And any color that you can share around if it came from existing products versus new products or increases in content, that would be very helpful. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. No, thank you. I guess the short answer is kind of all of the above, Wamsi. I think we did see more-than-expected strength in smartphones, but also in wearables. And I would say it's on existing, but also, in particular, on new products. So, I think we've just seen a little bit better demand from a variety of customers across a variety of products. It is maybe the easiest way to answer that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open. Excuse me, Jim, please check your mute function. Your line is now open. Go ahead, Jim Suva. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Hi. It's Jim Suva here. When you mentioned the mobile devices, was it mostly on, like, unit volumes? Was it on your design-in features? Because I remember like six months ago, we had talked about changes in designs and things like that. And now, we're pleased that things are better. Just kind of curious about, was it more volumes or designs or a combination of both and how should we think about that? Because at the beginning of the year, I know there were a lot of questions around designs and content on the mobility side. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, I think, Jim, relative to our exceeding our outlook, I would just say that the mobile devices we saw strength really across platforms with a variety of customers, both on new and existing platforms, and that's a combination of new designs, existing designs on things like smartphones, wearables and otherwise. So, it's not necessarily, at this stage, a change in architecture because I think we talked about that early in the year. And I think by the third quarter, most of those architectures are already well settled. So, I would credit this more with just better volumes and our ability, in particular, to meet those better volumes from customers, which is not the easiest thing in the world. Our team, to come into the quarter with an expectation of kind of low double-digit sequential growth, but in the end to achieve a 32% sequential increase in sales in mobile devices, that requires an enormous amount of agility to ramp up in the face of that demand. And I'd just give an enormous amount of credit to our team to ramp up in the face of that. And as usual, the agility of our mobile devices team, I think, is really second to none in our company or across the industry. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the clarification. It's greatly appreciated. Adam Norwitt : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Shawn Harrison of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Afternoon, everybody. And congrats on the strong results. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Shawn. Craig Lampo : Thank you, Shawn. Shawn Harrison : An easy one first and then a follow-up that's maybe not as easy. Craig, what were the actual restructuring charges taken in the quarter that I'm assuming don't repeat here in the December quarter? Craig Lampo : Yeah. Thanks, Shawn. As you know, we typically really don't call out restructuring expenses. And they were included in our adjusted operating margin of the 19.7% and we don't call those out as non-GAAP items since, as we know, we hold ourselves accountable and our general managers fully accountable for these costs. So, I guess what I would say from a perspective of magnitude, I'd say even considering these incremental costs incurred in the quarter, our year-over-year conversion on the third quarter, the relatively significant organic decline is still only slightly higher than the kind of normal downside conversion range. And as a matter of fact, to even answer a question you didn't ask, which is as it relates to the fourth quarter, which really doesn't have any significant costs in there related to restructuring of any magnitude, I would say that we do expect the year-over-year conversion as we step up into the fourth quarter on lower sales to be very strong and actually will have higher margins on a lower sequential sales amount. Shawn Harrison : Okay. As a follow-up, Adam, what are you hearing from your distributors more on the industrial side of the business, particularly given this European weakness? Are you going to see inventory corrections persist well into 2020? Just any updated outlook you're seeing from your distribution partners in light of the incremental European weakness? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Shawn, you are the expert on this even more than I. But I will just say that the industrial trends today \u2013 industrial is the market that is more heavily distributed for us as you know well. The industrial trends are not the most favorable. I think we came into the quarter with a certain expectation. You'll recall, last quarter, we talked about the fact that, in the second half, we had anticipated previously a step-up in both the industrial and automotive markets. We then came to the conclusion through the course of the second quarter that that was not going to happen. We saw that indication from our distributors and OEM customers. And I think, this quarter, it got maybe a little weaker on both fronts there again. And so, from the distribution perspective, our distribution sales in total were down on a sequential basis.  We haven't seen from an inventory perspective that kind of big spikes or changes in the inventory, but I think the end demand is really flowing through the distribution channel in that way. What does that mean going forward? It's always very hard for me to predict that. I think it's definitely too early to call a kind of a recovery in industrial market. I think you all see no doubt the same reports that I see. And I don't know that anybody is really calling that recovery, and I certainly wouldn't be the first to call it such a recovery. And so, as we head into next year, I think we're still \u2013 there is still a high degree of uncertainty about industrial demand trends, in particular, in Europe, but not only in Europe. The European industrial market is intimately related to the automotive market. And I don't think it should come as any surprise that, as people thought the second half would have a recovery in automotive and then that didn't come, that ultimately manifests itself in less industrial equipment manufacturing and demand, and I think that's kind of what we're seeing here in the quarter. So, when does that make its way through the distribution channel? What levels of inventories that the distributors ultimately conclude are the appropriate levels? I have a hard time to pin that down right now. I think what is our team doing in the face of this? Well, we're doing what we always do. We're making adjustments where we have to make those adjustments. And some of our industrial operations have had to quickly react to that, having had different expectations coming into the second half of the year. And then, we're going out there and continuing to design in products with customers where there remains a very, very strong amount of industrial electronics design-in activities. And so, that level of new product innovation, working on new applications with customers, enabling next generation factories, enabling the electronification of all of these industrial equipment that we work on, none of that work has slowed. To the contrary, I would say that our industrial customers around the world are still seeking ways to create new functionalities, new capabilities with their equipment, and that's something that our teams are intimately involved in around the world. So, like always, it's one of those times where we've got to get our costs aligned. We deal with what comes our way from our distributors and our OEMs, but we continue to focus on building next-generation products that can enable our customers' next generation systems. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Your line is now open. Matthew Sheerin : Yes. Thanks. And good afternoon. I guess, Craig, a follow-up question on Shawn's question regarding the cost-cutting efforts and the margins. As you pointed out, you should be back over 32% gross margin and operating margin should be back over 20%, despite a couple hundred million dollar decline in revenue due to those efforts. As you look forward, and Adam talked about some areas of incremental weakness in some units, should we expect continued cost-cutting efforts at the operating level as we get into 2020? And given, as you said, those acquisitions total, I think, $500 million in revenue run rate, typically come in below the operating levels of the company, are there plans to see that or those margins improve as you get into next year? Craig Lampo : Yeah, sure. No, thanks for the question. I think I would say, as we go forward, of course, if there is a significant shift in the demand environment that we're going to clearly take action. And our general managers, as they did in the third quarter, are going to clearly react to that and adjust the levels of their businesses to the reality of the demand environment. We've taken the action today that we see given the current demand environment. So, I wouldn't say I would call out any current plans to make any significant changes in the next quarter or so. But this could change based on the current demand environment. So, we're guiding to what we see. I'm not going to comment per se on 2020 yet. We'll talk about that in January as we see that. But, clearly, the game plan in terms of our playbook hasn't changed as it relates to our reaction and our adjustment in terms of the cost structure. But we feel pretty good about the actions that are taken today. We've done a good job and the general managers really did an outstanding job of reacting to the reduced demand expectations. And we do look forward to certainly realizing the benefits of those restructuring actions given the current demand environment and protecting the margins that we have. Adam Norwitt : And the one thing I would add to that, Matt, is we don't talk about this, as you know, very often. I think the reason we did make some mention of it last quarter is there was a real sudden change in the third quarter outlook from what we had anticipated coming into it, not required a quicker and more magnified reactivity from our teams. We talked extensively 90 days ago about why we were reducing our outlook at that point because of the variety of factors related to the trade war, related to the automotive, industrial market, distribution and otherwise, and that did result in a significant reduction in demand for some of our operations which did require them to take a very quick actions, which they all did. These are tough things. And we don't take lightly the actions that everybody took that dislocated people, that caused disruption, but I give a lot of credit to our organizations around the world who faced to that, that they were able to make it happen in the Amphenol way to take out the costs and to get out there, reallocating resources, so that we can continue to drive strong progress for the company going forward. Matthew Sheerin : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, Adam, just regarding the mobile network space, which was a little bit better, still down. You're guiding down sequentially. I know there's been supplier issues, obviously trade issues. What's your take on the 5G ramp as we head into next year? I know, recently, you've sounded a little bit more cautious in terms of the near-term opportunity. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Look, I think we're very excited for the long term with 5G. Our teams have done a great job of designing in a wide array of products into 5G systems with really the whole range of equipment manufacturers, working with operators around the world to ensure that when that spending does happen, we will be well positioned for it. And I feel very good about the position that we have put ourselves in. What I am not so expert at is saying when is that spending going to come. There is already some 5G spending. No doubt about it. There are networks, test networks being put in place, there is drips of spending happening in a variety of places, no doubt about it. When will it have that overall impact that will be truly meaningful to the capital spending of service providers around the world? I think that's hard to say. I think a lot of it is really resting on the underlying economics of these networks. What are people going to be willing to pay more for and thereby support wireless operators to increase their capital spending? That dynamic is probably above my pay grade to determine when that happens, but all I can tell you is we will be ready when it does. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First question for me was on the automotive market. Adam, you talked about the view for automotive for the full year sales being up slightly. And I think [ indiscernible 0 :44:19] low-single digits. Just trying to better understand, is that a downtick? If so, where are you seeing it? And any impact from the GM strike that may have impacted the automotive business? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Mark. I'll just address the GM strike, first. It was not a meaningful impact. We obviously prefer for our customers to be producing stuff, instead of being on strike. So, happy to hear that there are resolutions in sight, but it was not a meaningful impact on our performance in the quarter. I think the automotive market, if we looked at it in the quarter as it trended, it was very clear that, across the three regions, the most negative trending was in Europe where we were down sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, organically down. But really that trending in Europe seem to be the weakest of the regions. I would say that, in North America, the trending was maybe even a little bit pickup in the quarter and that's despite what we just mentioned. In Asia, it was essentially on par with the prior-year quarter. So, I guess, of all the regions, we would feel a little less comfortable with the prospects in Europe right now. And then, the other two, we would feel roughly similar confidence across the two of them. It's not an enormous change in our outlook here for automotive. I think, last quarter, we took down that outlook more significantly. I would just say, on the margin, it's a bit worse here as we look into the finish of the year. And as we look into next year, it remains to be same how that will come. We came into this year thinking the second half would be a step up and that everybody was kind of calling a bottom. I don't know really whether that is the bottom or what that overall trend is going to be going forward, but I just think it's probably still too early to tell how that industry really evolved over the coming quarters. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the mobile devices segment. Not looking for any 2020 revenue guidance, but just trying to think through the opportunity set for the company. Technology inflections like 5G are good opportunities for technical leaders like Amphenol to innovate. And you talked about some of the headwinds and architectural changes this year. But as you think about 2020, how are you thinking about that opportunity set in terms of some of the architectural design changes maybe becoming tailwind instead of a headwind as it relates to 5G? As you're looking at that potential opportunity set, is there any opportunity for a much more diversified set of material customers in mobile devices for Amphenol in the 5G world? In 4G, the revenue had been at times concentrated to large OEM. And curious if you can be a bit more broad-based in the 5G world. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks, Mark. Look, mobile devices market, you're asking me to talk about 2020 and I have a hard time talking about November. This is an inherently very difficult market to give an outlook on. As you know, I am dreadfully bad at it over a number of years. I guess, as we head into the end of this year and we look into next year, we would never get out in front of our skis in terms of an outlook for that market to be much more than a kind of a flattish outlook. It's very hard to give a prognosis of that. But in terms of the long-term trends that you talked about, whether that's 5G, whether that's the higher mechanical complexity of devices, whether that is the different architectures that are being put into the phones, we still feel very good about the long-term prognosis for the mobile devices market, and that's coming off of a year here where we expect it to be down in the mid-20% range. And why do we feel good about that is because we continue to see our customers driving to equip their mobile devices, whatever they may be, with more functionality for the customers. And we've talked about this for a long, long time that our position in the mobile devices rests on the presumption that our customers are going to want to make their products better, that these are not just kind of empty carriers of a standard software, but rather the ability to sell a phone to a demanding customer does depend in part on the customer's ability -- on our customer, the manufacturer's abilities to equip those products with new features. And some of those features ultimately created demand for our unique high-technology products. And if our products can help make those ultimately devices more salable, more functional, having more use for the end customer, then our customers are going to share with us some of the value that we ultimately create. And that's the underlying philosophy of how we work in that market. And so, as I think about the long term with things like 5G, with more complex devices, I feel very good about the long-term for that. But it doesn't take away from the inherent volatility of the market. And so, as we come into next year, I'm going to try really hard to give an outlook that's dependable. And I probably won't do a very good job of it based on my track record. We have guided that market to be flat roughly, and we've been wrong every time. Luckily, we have been wrong to the good side of that more times than not. But this year, we were obviously wrong to the bad side of that, being down as we are in the kind of mid-20% range. Relative to the customer set, there are only so many people who make these devices around the world and we work with all of them. And we will work with whoever that is that is driving the next successful range of products. We've been successful in this market for such a long time. I remember when the leader in the market where people who today don't even make mobile devices and we were a leader then. And as that cycled through the variety of different companies who led the innovation and thereby captured the hearts and minds and wallets of their end customers, we were able to create a vibrant business that grew over the long term. And so, regardless of which customers are successful in next-generation systems, we feel very good about our position. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Hi. Good afternoon. Just one question from me. Adam, just over the past 90 days, if you could sort of give us a sense of your perceptions on demand in China has changed or not changed? And also your ability to operate in the region, if there's been any changes? Are you concerned about any changes? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. Look, last time \u2013 at our last call, we had very extensive discussions, as you know, about China with respect to the Department of Commerce restrictions that were put in place on Huawei and other entities. And I think we said at the time that it was still very early and we were dealing with that as we always do by having a very, very strong local team. And I will just tell you that some of our outperformance this quarter was the result really of that local team stepping up and really doing a great job to satisfy some demand that was a bit higher than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, in particular in IT datacom and, to a lesser extent, in mobile networks. The fact of us having a complete organization everywhere around the world and including in China where we have real leaders of the company who have every function under their supervision, totally accountable for everything that they do, designing products, ensuring the quality of those products, manufacturing those products, automating those products, interfacing with the customer, all on a local basis, has positioned us, on a relative basis, stronger than maybe some of our international peers who have more reliance on Western resources. And I think that has allowed us in the quarter to continue to reinforce to our customers, whoever they may be, that Amphenol will be there when you need us most. Obviously, we comply with every restriction and every law, but our nature of our organization is such that we're able to serve customers where maybe others would not.  On the overall situation in China, look, we have said for a long time that we don't believe that these trade wars are a positive thing for anybody. We continue to look forward to a productive resolution to the trade war and we continue to be very happy that our business is very localized around the world. We talked last quarter about the sort of sea change that may or may not be happening in the world between going from a global world to a local world, this kind of new world order that some are talking about it. And I will just say that we remain very, very happy with our kind of purpose-built organization here of local management, with local authority who work on a real local basis with customers. And so, I think as we go forward in China, our local team will continue to service the heck out of their customers and make sure that those customers know that they're going to get the best of the best here from those individuals who don't have to necessarily rely on resources overseas to help them solve the problems that they need solved. What will happen long term? Again, I'm optimistic for a peaceful and productive resolution of all these things, but we're prepared either way. Steven Fox : Great. I appreciate that color. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, great. Thank you. Yes, Adam, so in the IT datacom business, can you talk about what you're seeing in cloud. I know kind of cloud, which was strong for a number of years, kind of wobbled a little bit early in the year. But just what you're seeing from those customers and if there's anything noticeable by region. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Look, we still are very happy with our position among all of these web service providers or cloud providers. Was there a little bit of a wobble as you term it? I guess there was a little bit of a wobble. But that's not abnormal. We've talked about the dynamic being so different between a service provider and an OEM that \u2013 OEMs, they are in the business of kind of keeping a relatively steady manufacturing process going, and that can insulate the volatility of the end demand. Whereas, when you're dealing with the service provider, they want the stuff when they need it, and they don't want it when they don't need it, and that can create a level of volatility that we're very accustomed to. We were accustomed to it early on with our exposure to the broadband market, our exposure to the mobile networks market. And so, as the IT datacom market has evolved to include a significant component of these service providers, our teams have really been able to react very quickly to those demands. And reacting quickly doesn't just mean that sometimes they don't need the product and you have to adjust your cost. It also means that you've got to ramp-up really quickly because sometimes they call you and they need a lot more stuff than you expected or that they expected because they've decided they're going to build a new data center and the work crews are ready that day and the weather is good and they're ready to build and you better get them the parts. And so, that reactivity is something that I think our team has done a really great job on. Now, how does that market look right now? I'd say that it's relatively normal as it is today. Maybe early in the year, it was a little bit, again your term wobble, but I think that we see good demand from that market. On a regional basis, I would say, it is more dominated by North America. Just the more famous cloud providers all tend to be the ones who are spending the most on CapEx and whatnot. Those companies do tend to be North American and then followed closely behind maybe in Asia, in particular in China, but I would say our business tends to be probably more heavily weighted in North America, which is not inconsistent with the weighting of where the money is being spent. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Thanks for that. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the military business, phenomenal growth this year at 20%. Certainly, it would be tough to sustain at that level. But even if it were to decelerate from here, can you talk about maybe some of the dollar content drivers and visibility you have into military? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, I think you said it well. It's a phenomenal performance here, and I just can't can credit enough our team around the world working in the military market. This is not an easy market to achieve 26% year-over-year growth in. These are very complex products, very complex, long manufacturing processes, heavy degrees of manufacturing, vertical integration, the quality requirements, the technology associated with this product does not necessarily lend itself well to quick ramp ups of production. And I'd just give our team an enormous amount of credit for managing through this and really executing when the demand is there. In terms of looking ahead, 20% year-over-year growth is very strong. We achieved that last year. We expect to achieve that here this year. I wouldn't expect that in perpetuity. These are very, very strong years. We're dealing with a lot of expansion, both of the budgets, but also of the content of electronics. And as you talked about that content, to your question, we see increased content really across the board in the military. So, when you talk about a land vehicle and you look at all the systems, communications, electronic warfare, defense systems that go into a vehicle of today, I've had the good opportunity to walk into some of these vehicles and sit in them, and you feel like you're sitting in a data center, not in a tank or an armored personnel carrier. When you look at the airplanes of today, the next-generation fighter jets and the upgrades to prior generation fighter jets, again, just an incredible array of electronic systems that are being integrated into these next-generation platforms in order to create functionalities that didn't exist. We see a lot of growth in the naval, for example, another area that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, again, putting high speed data transfer into naval applications where, in the past, you would not necessarily have had that. So, I wouldn't say that there is any one part of the military market, which is disproportionately increasing in its content. We think the militaries around the world have woken up and said the electronics can help them do their jobs better, and I think ultimately that creates a good long-term opportunity for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein of SunTrust. Your line is now open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two. First, Adam, you referred to the acquisitions you did this quarter as platforms. And I know that the company has a long history of M&A and maybe you've used this term before, but I wonder if there is any significance to that? Are they different from either a geo or a customer or a market perspective that would make these somewhat different from others that you've done in the last couple of years? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Actually, it's not a new word for me to term our acquisitions. And, in fact, it's a real criteria for us. Because if we're going to make an acquisition, we work very hard to generate the cash that we generate and we're happy to generate a lot of it this last quarter. To put that money to work in an acquisition, you don't do it just to bring the size of revenues in at the time that you bought it. That seems like a lot of work just to add revenues.  We look for acquisitions that have great people, great products and great position, all of which help you to build a platform for that company to perform better as part of Amphenol. And so, I use that term platform very broadly because it is a necessary precondition for us. We're not going to buy a company if we don't think it can become a platform to grow better its performance as part of the Amphenol family. And again, that can come through opening up new markets, new geographies, new customers, through the attachment of different technologies and the collaboration with other operations in the company or also a platform for profitability expansion by gaining access to Amphenol's ability and experience in low-cost areas, access to supply chain and otherwise. All of that can be a platform for accelerating growth and driving increased profitability, and that's what we always look for. At the time these companies come in, sometimes they are, and maybe even oftentimes at lower margins than we are today, and I think Craig talked about that in terms of the impact on the conversion margins on a quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year basis, but we always look for companies that have potential far beyond where they perform today and that's to me the real essence of a platform. William Stein : Great. That helps. I didn't recall the word being used before, but I understand that and appreciate the clarification. One more if I can. It seems pretty clear that the trade conflict is meaningful, maybe the majority or maybe all of the sort of problems we're facing now in the macro and as it influences your business. In your view, if we were to get a resolution on the trade conflict in the near term, would you expect demand to rebound strongly based on what you're seeing in, let's say, within the following year, like 2020? Or do you perceive maybe the tariffs have maybe damaged demand conditions for a more protracted period? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Look, this is a big question. But I will say a couple of things here. Number one, you referred to the fact that the trade conflict is really the root of all the problems. I don't know if I would 100% agree with that. You could have an academic argument over whether the instigation of the trade war ultimately led to uncertainty, which led to then other markets unrelated to the trade war to have some changes in their demand. I don't know that the European automotive market, as one example, or the industrial market in Europe, I don't think that's directly related to the trade war. Could it have a secondary or tertiary impact? Sure. Trade wars have lots of impacts that you don't normally anticipate at the time that you launched them and that could very well be the case, but I don't know that those are directly correlated and linked to the US-China trade situation or to other trade situations that exist. And thus, if there was a sort of grand bargain, a grand deal that resolved everything, I don't know that that is kind of the elixir that solves all the uncertainties in the world economy. And to that extent, when you think about tariffs, tariffs have been a real hassle. There is no doubt about it. And I think our team has done a fabulous job of managing through those tariffs since they were put in place more than a year ago. And I give just an enormous amount of credit to our team to manage through that and we managed through that in the very sort of Amphenolian way, just case by case, part number by part number, operation by operation. Those were a hassle and a diversion and a lot of work that created stress in relationships and otherwise things like that, but I don't know that the tariffs themselves were the cause of overall changes in demand. Now, we talked a lot last quarter about the restrictions that were put in place by the US, which may or may not be a component of the trade war and the tariffs. That clearly had an impact on demand. And I think when we looked at \u2013 or when we talked last quarter about the kind of knock-on effects of that demand expectations from customers who saw lower outlooks in China, does that get resolved if the trade war gets resolved? It depends, I think. I don't know what really the answer is to that. I would hope that some would, but I would not anticipate a big kind of snap back in the overall world economy if there were a sort of grand resolution. I think that has metastasized a little bit here and created a broader degree of uncertainty that is not just confined to the fact of one country or another putting tariffs on each other. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano of Cowen. Your line is now open. Joseph Giordano : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Joseph Giordano : Hey. We kind of covered just a little bit on military, but maybe you want to come at it in a slightly different way. When I look at the last three years really, if I look at your guide as we go into the year kind of in that low to mid and then this year high and then obviously a huge ramp each year from that initial view, and I know you like to be conservative, I'm just curious about the level of visibility exiting this year relative to the last couple of years. Does it feel kind of the same? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. The level of visibility \u2013 look, military has a little bit longer visibility than other markets. As you know, lead times are a little bit longer. Programs are a little bit more stable. All that being said, I can tell you that you're always just one spending cycle away and budgets get passed, and then they don't have necessarily the same degree of allocations to certain programs. That can always happen. But I think, from our customers, we do get a little bit more visibility than we would \u2013 certainly than in a market like mobile devices. Look, if you look over the last three years, last year we grew 20%, the year before we grew 13%, this year we're going to grow around 20% and we came into the year with a more modest expectation. Do we have today visibility for next year? Not perfectly, for sure. I think 90 days from now, we'll try to give you our best estimate of what next year is going to look like. I would not expect it to be three years in a row, growing at 20%. I guess I can go out on a limb and say something like that right now, but we still think, long term, it has a very favorable trend. Joseph Giordano : Okay. And then, Craig, maybe just quick, embedded in your current guidance on the margin side, how much, if any, is a tailwind from lower incentive comp, if there is? Craig Lampo : Yeah. I would say that \u2013 that's kind of spread out throughout the year. And I wouldn't say it has a significant impact on the overall margin guidance. There is a lot of things that happen in the costs and sort of margin in a year like this. And I would say that's just one of many, I guess, things that are happening within the cost. But, certainly, we're going to have lower incentive disbursements than we had over the last year. And without a doubt, that's going to be lower this year. But I wouldn't necessarily call it out as a tailwind to the operating margins. That is something that is accretive to the bottom line of any significance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good afternoon, Adam, Craig. Hope you're doing well. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon to you, Deepa. Deepa Raghavan : Yeah. Two questions from me, Adam. First off, looking back, when you guided Q3, did you really get the sense that macro reads were so bad that revenue would be down double-digit organic basis for Amphenol? You ended doing half of that, at down 6%. Or did you bake in a substantial amount of caution within, despite what the drivers were telling you? I think my underlying question, where I'm trying to go with this is, did mobile devices, IT and defense alone coming in better, intra-quarter, explain why you did better than the high end of your guide or was there a meaningful conservatism also? Adam Norwitt : Look, we know, Deepa \u2013 we try every 90 days to give you and your colleagues the best estimate that we can on the basis of what we know at the time. And, obviously, last quarter, we came into the quarter on the heels of the significant changes that happened during the course of the second quarter that impacted IT datacom, that impacted mobile networks and that impacted, to some lesser extent, automotive and industrial. And those are really the markets last quarter that we saw as a much more negative than we had seen coming into than the second quarter. The fact that we outperformed here in the third quarter in mobile devices and that also in military and IT datacom, and we outperformed in a few of the other markets, but I think you correctly point out, those are the three that probably moved the needle the most. I think it's just a testament to the fact that, number one, in mobile devices, it's a very hard market to predict. And if there is extra demand, our team is poised to take advantage of it on a moment's notice. And they did a great job of that. On military, again, I would really credit here execution more than anything because I talked before about how hard it is to ramp up and our team just did a fabulous job of really satisfying customer demand and we weren't necessarily sure that we could do that going into the quarter. And in IT and, to a lesser extent, mobile networks, I think we had taken \u2013 I don't know if you want to call it a conservative view, but we would call it a realistic view of our sales in \u2013 especially to some of the customers in China that we talked about. And we did a little bit better than that. And I think we didn't \u2013 it was hard to get a read at the time on what demand those customers would have because they had a real complex array of problems that they had to deal with in terms of availability of components and otherwise. And I think our local team just did a great job when they realized that there was more demand to satisfy that demand in a moment's notice. And so, I wouldn't say that we came in and we're kind of overly cautious, but I think we gave our best view of the quarter, just as we're doing right now for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we're pleased that our team did a good job to do better than that. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. That's fair. My follow-up is, to the extent you're able to share based on your conversations with your customers and how they are planning ahead, which of these end markets are your clients planning for weakness to extend well beyond this year and which are the ones are they planning for it to get better? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I think I've talked about a few of the markets already. And again, the last thing I want to do right now, especially in a year like 2019, is get ahead of myself in giving a guidance for 2020. 90 days from now, we're going to try to do our best to give you a guidance for 2020. But I think that's hard to do in the current environment. But I did, I think, already mention the fact that we would anticipate still continued strong demand in military, albeit maybe not at the levels that we talked about. It's hard to say in a market like industrial and automotive what really those trends are. If I had to say right now, I'd say that it's a relatively modest outlook right now. I think, in mobile devices, I wouldn't expect our business to be down as we expected this year by so much, but I also wouldn't ever get ahead of my skis on that market to say that that's going to be up by any measure. And I think I've talked about many of the other markets already. But, look, 90 days from now, we're going to try really hard to give you a good outlook. There is still remaining a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and we're going to be very thoughtful about that as we go through the quarter, collecting as much information as we can through our deep engagements with customers across all of our markets, and then we'll give it our best shot in January. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Michael Fisher asking a question in behalf of Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Your line is now open. Michael Fisher : Thanks. Yeah. I was wondering, could you touch on gross margins in the quarter? I think it was down about 60 basis points. I was just wondering some of the drivers and if there is any of that kind of restructuring or cost savings plan items that hit the gross margin line? Craig Lampo : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think that as it relates to gross margins, as you know \u2013 I'm not sure how long you've been covering the company, but we don't usually talk specifically about gross margins because we do measure ourselves really at the operating margin level, which really ensures attention, we believe, to all aspects of cost and certainly very pleased at the operating margin performance of the 19.7%, which I did mention earlier that we did have from restructuring items that did impact that performance in the third quarter. I would note that most of those restructuring items, or the vast majority, certainly were impacting the gross margin line. So, there is some impact at the gross margin line as a result of those restructuring actions. So, I guess, I would not point out, I guess, anything specifically that's driving that other than maybe that. And certainly, I also have mentioned the acquisitions and the impact on the margin, the operating margin percentage and, ultimately, also the gross margin percentage on a year-over-year basis, which also is \u2013 would have some impact. Even though those certainly are accretive at the EPS level, they are having some impact at the margin and, therefore, gross margin level. But I do want to stress that we clearly try to drive all aspects of cost and, ultimately, drive operating margin versus just gross margin or SG&A. Michael Fisher : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one more. The weakness on the industrial side, can you maybe talk about kind of linearity of the trends we are seeing there? And then, maybe what was the delta between the trends from OEMs versus distributors? You had mentioned there were some different dynamics there. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, I think between OEMs and distributors, I wouldn't say that there were necessarily material differences to the dynamics in the quarter. In terms of linearity, I guess you mean through the course of the quarter, I wouldn't say that there was anything notable on the linearity of our industrial business during the course of the quarter. Did it weaken over the course of the quarter? I guess so. We talked to you 90 days ago which was close to the end of the first month of the quarter and we thought a certain thing, and by the end of the quarter it was a bit worse than that. So, I guess, one would say that there was a little bit of linear \u2013 lack of linearity that it got a little bit worse through the course of the quarter. Thus here we are changing our outlook in that market here again. But I wouldn't say anything real meaningful to either of those. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Samik Chatterjee of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off on the content growth on the automotive side. I understand your comments on the automotive end market deteriorating a bit further. Just looking at kind of your organic guidance for this year. You're probably guiding to more like a 3% revenue decline organically. If I compare that to the global production outlook of down 6%, that outperformance or content gain seems to be a bit more moderated at what we've seen over the last couple of years. So, just wanted to understand if you're seeing any kind of push out of launches that's maybe impacting how you gain content this year as the volumes are lower? Or is there something else in terms of, like, the mix of geographies, et cetera, that's going on there? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thank you very much. And I should extend a welcome to you to our call. I think you just picked up coverage yesterday. Look, I think content growth in automotive continues to be very robust. We still see a lot of opportunities with customers. We're pushing new electronics into their cars of all types of platforms. And I mentioned some of those areas, things like new electronic drivetrains, some of those real far out things like autonomous driving and otherwise. But even more near term, there is just so much electronics, whether that's passenger infotainment, whether that's emissions control, engine control, whether that is different safety mechanisms that go into cars, you name it. I'd tell you, every car I get into and I rent a lot of cars because I travel a lot, and every one of these cars, it takes me a long time to figure out how to do a lot of different stuff because there's so many different features that go into these cars. Craig and I were \u2013 just a few weeks back, we were in Europe and we ended up renting a car and we were in that car for way too long driving around Europe to lots of different operations. And there was about a two, three hour ramp-up time to learn all the different feature sets in that car. And each one of those things you're learning is a new electronic system that requires a certain degree of interconnect, sensor and antennas in order to enable that. So, I would not say that we have seen any slowdown in the adoption of new electronics, and thus the content among automakers around the world. I think the fact that we are down this year organically roughly to the levels that you talked about, which is certainly better than the overall units, is a reflection of that content. But you should also bear in mind that whenever you have a reduction, the whole supply chain has to react to that reduction. I think there's been lots of various companies talking about the whole automotive supply chain. It's a big supply chain. It's a supply chain that's been working \u2013 really going up into the right for close to a decade. And so, sometimes the impact can be a little bit more magnified on someone like us who is a little bit farther down the chain in certain of those instances. But we feel very good about our automotive market long term. When I just reflect back on the last decade, this is a market that, at the beginning of 2009, was a market that represented less than 5% of our sales. It was on a run rate of less than $150 million a year. And here it is 10 times that size over a decade. And I think that real outsized growth that we've had in automotive has been not us taking business out of the hands of someone who already had that business. Rather, it was us capitalizing on new developments in cars, new electronics being implemented, not having new products together with the acquisitions that we've made to enable those next generation systems.  And we don't see long-term that dynamic really changing at all. I think consumers still thirst for next generation functionality in their vehicles, regardless of what the drivetrain system of that vehicle is, regardless of the size of that vehicle, whether they're buying a sports car or a minivan, they want to have next generation electronics embedded in that system for passenger use, for safety, for fuel economy, you name it. And I think our company is very well positioned today to capitalize upon that. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. If I can just quickly follow-up on the broadband segment, I think you mention it did come in a bit better than you expected, although customer spending continues to be kind of a challenge there. Is it that we should kind of think about some upside? Did kind of customer spending come in better? Or was it more kind of design wins that really kind of drove better-than-expected revenues for you? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I think it was just, first of all, small. It's a relatively small market, 4% of sales in the quarter. And, yes, we did a little bit better than we expected, but we're not talking about huge numbers here. And still, on a year-over-year basis, it was down. We didn't change our outlook for the year in the broadband market. So, I wouldn't say that there is anything meaningfully different in our overall view of that market here as we come into the fourth quarter. Operator : Speakers, we show no further questions at this time. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much. And again, thank you all for all of your time today and we wish you all a great conclusion to the year. And I shudder to say that we will talk to you all in 2020. Thanks very much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business, as well as current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, we may refer in this call to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $2.151 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.03 and $0.98 respectively. Sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the fourth quarter decreased 8%. Sequentially, sales were up 2% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 1% organically. Breaking sales down into our two segments, the Interconnect business, which comprise 95% of our sales, was down 3% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our Cable business, which comprised the remainder of our sales, was down 3% in U.S. dollars and down 1% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2019, sales were a record $8.225 billion, which was flat in U.S. dollars, up 2% in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2018. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Adjusted operating income was $430 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 20%, which compared to 21% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 19.7% in the third quarter of 2019. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22% in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was down compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 at 22.8%. This reduction was primarily driven by normal downside conversion on the organic decline in sales, as well as the impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating at profitability levels before the company -- below the company average. In the cable segment, margins were 10%, which was down compared to 11.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by volume and product mix. For the full year 2019, adjusted operating income was $1.645 billion, down 3% from 2018. We continue to be very proud of the company's operating margin achievement, which reached 20% for the full year 2019, especially given the demand environment. This performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture, in which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust to market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in any market environment. Through the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies, our management team has achieved industry-leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future. Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million compares to $26 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for the fourth quarter 2019, compared to 25.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate for both periods excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises. In the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the tax effect of acquisition-related costs as well as the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 20.3%, compared to 21% in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% compared to 25.5% in 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises, as well as the tax effect of both acquisition-related costs and refinancing related costs associated with the debt tender offer in the third quarter of 2019. Full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2019 was 22.2% compared to 23.4% in 2018. Adjusted net income was a strong 14% of sales for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS declined by 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.03 compared to $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2018. And adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.07 to $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.75, a 3% decrease from 2018 GAAP diluted EPS of $3.85. And adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2019, a 1% decrease from 2018 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.77. Orders for the quarter were $2.200 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $424 million in the fourth quarter and a record $1.502 billion for the full year or 140% and 131% of adjusted net income respectively. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $352 million and the full -- for the full year was a record $1.207 billion or 117% and 105% of adjusted net income respectively. These are excellent cash flow results and reflect the hard work of the management team around the world and carefully managing working capital in the uncertain economic environment in 2019. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $867 million respectively at the end of December. And inventory days, days' sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 73 and 53 days respectively, all within our normal range. The cash flow from operations of $424 million along with proceeds from exercise of stock options of $100 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of approximately $95 million net of translation were used primarily to repay $366 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs and other facilities, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditures of $72 million on acquisitions of $47 million repurchased approximately $43 million of the company's stock and fund acquisitions of and distributions to non-controlled interest of $18 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $103 under the $2 billion stock repurchase plan bringing total repurchases for the year to 6.5 million shares or $600 million. At December 31st, cash and short-term investments were $909 million, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. And at year-end, the company had issued $395 million under its U.S. and euro commercial paper programs. The company's cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled $3 billion. Total debt at December 31st was $3.6 billion and net debt was $2.7 billion. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 was $522 million and $2 billion, respectively. In summary this is a strong quarter and full year for the company financially especially in light of the continued uncertainty across the global markets. And I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much and welcome to all of you to our first call of the new decade here in 2020 and I hope it's not too late for me to wish everybody on the call a Happy New Year. As Craig mentioned I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. And then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2020. And of course we'll reserve some time at the end for some questions. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in both sales and adjusted EPS. And that's despite an ongoing environment of uncertainty in the global economy. Sales were down by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies but reached $2.151 billion. On an organic basis as Craig described, sales were down by 8% and that was largely driven by the significant reductions in the mobile devices and mobile networks markets. The company booked $2.2 billion in orders in the quarter and that represented a strong book-to-bill of 1.02 to 1. Despite our decline in sales in the quarter adjusted operating margins held up very strongly reaching 20% and the company generated excellent operating cash flow of $424 million in the quarter, really another reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. I just have to say I remain very proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic economic environment all while driving superior operating performance in the quarter. Also very pleased to announce that just in the last several days we closed the acquisition of EXA Thermometrics. EXA is a provider of high technology temperature sensors based in Bangalore, India with annual sales of approximately $10 million. And while EXA is still a relatively small company, the company strengthens our overall sensor offering and expands our sensor manufacturing footprint to India. EXA represents an excellent complement to our growing portfolio of sensor products, which have become a core pillar of Amphenol's overall interconnect offering. As we welcome this outstanding new team to the Amphenol family, we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into our family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now let me just make a couple of comments about the full year 2019. And despite the many challenges in the global economy in 2019, it was a successful year for Amphenol. Amidst significant organic declines in the mobile devices market as well as moderations in demand in several other markets that we discussed early last year, we are very pleased to have just surpassed our 2018 sales levels. Our full year operating -- full year adjusted operating margins once again reached 20%. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.74. And very importantly, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion respectively both of which are excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution together with our disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program created great value for the company in 2019 with nine new companies added to the Amphenol family in the year. These acquisitions which included SSI, Aorora, Copec, Charles Industries, CONEC, Bernd Richter, GJM, Cablescan and finally XGiga expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets. We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance, in particular because of the outstanding and talented individuals that have joined the Amphenol organization. These new Amphenolians as we call them deepen our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition in 2019, we deployed further our capital by buying back over 6.5 million shares under our share buyback program, while also increasing our quarterly dividend by 9%. Amphenol's long-term mission is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution. Through the organic development efforts of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, together with the benefits of our acquisition program, we have expanded our relationships with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets. This has resulted in the company's strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry. And while the overall market environment in 2019 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is very confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior performance into the long-term. Now, turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. I would just note that we continue to be very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification remains a real high-value asset for the company. No single end market in the year represented more than 20% of our sales. And we believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to all of the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Now, turning first to the military market, the military market represented 13% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales again grew very strongly from prior year increasing by a greater-than-expected 30% in the fourth quarter, driven by growth across essentially all segments in the military market including in particular, military vehicles, rotorcraft, and airframe applications. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% with very strong performance given the normal fourth quarter seasonality that we've typically seen. For the full year 2019, we're very pleased that our military sales grew by an outstanding 23% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically, reflecting broad-based strength across virtually all segments of the market. Our organization working in the military market has worked so hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all of the segments of this important market. And I can just tell you that our superior performance in 2019 is a great reflection of the results of their efforts. Given the ongoing favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on this increased demand by supporting the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease slightly from these fourth quarter levels. And for the full year 2020, we expect to achieve mid to high single-digit sales growth on top of our already strong sales levels from 2019. Turning to the commercial air market, that market represented 5% of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. And sales in the fourth quarter increased by a stronger-than-anticipated 15% as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers continued to be robust. Sequentially, our sales increased by 8% from the third quarter, also a very strong performance. For the full year 2019, we're pleased that our sales grew by 14% as we benefited from broad design-ins of our next-generation interconnect products on new aircraft. Looking into 2020, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect sales to remain at roughly 2019's level as increased sales onto new jet platforms is offset by some impact from one program's widely reported production delays. Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2020, we remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes. And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come. The industrial market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in industrial in the fourth quarter grew by a bit stronger-than-expected 7% from prior year, driven largely by the contributions from our acquisitions completed over the past year. On an organic basis, sales actually declined by 3% as growth in instrumentation, alternative energy, and medical was more than offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis sales reduced by 2% from the third quarter reflecting continued moderation in the overall industrial market in particular in Europe. For the full year 2019, sales in the industrial market grew by 4% in U.S. dollars and were down by 3% organically as growth in medical, factory automation, rail mass transit and oil and gas were offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market. We remain very pleased with the company's broad position in the worldwide industrial market. And while the overall environment in 2019 became increasingly uncertain as the year progressed, we added several outstanding acquisitions, which strengthened our overall position. Through both our acquisition program, as well as our organic innovations, we've developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial market. We're proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. Looking into the first quarter 2020, we anticipate a slight decrease in sales from these levels as demand continues to be uncertain particularly in Europe. And for the full year 2020, we expect to realize low single-digit sales growth as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions, as well as our organic growth efforts. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year. Sales were stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter with revenues growing by 8% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currency driven by the contributions from our acquisitions completed earlier in the year. On an organic basis sales were flat from prior year as slowing vehicle volumes offset increased sales of products sold into new vehicle electronics applications. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter as we benefited from several new program launches. For the full year 2019, our sales in the automotive market grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency, but were down by 2% organically reflecting the benefits of our acquisitions as well as our broad array of new products into next-generation applications offset by the overall slowing of the worldwide automotive market. We continue to benefit from our long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisitions to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. Looking into the first quarter 2020, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels. And for the full year 2020, we expect a low single-digit sales increase for the automotive market. And while the overall market remains uncertain, we're confident that our broadened range of high-technology solutions positions us for continued growth in automotive into the future. The mobile devices market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter and 13% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in the mobile devices market exceeded our expectations coming into the fourth quarter growing 9% sequentially from the third quarter as our team executed extremely well to satisfy increased demand from customers making both smartphones and tablets. Compared to prior year sales were down by 35%, but which was better than we had expected especially in light of the very strong fourth quarter, we had had in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2019, sales in the mobile devices market decreased by 20%. And as we discussed extensively at the time of our first quarter earnings release, our reduction in sales for both the fourth quarter and the full year were driven really by changes in available content due to architectural shifts and product designs of certain smartphone models. We're pleased that the team outperformed our previously revised expectations of an approximately 30% reduction for the full year, a great testament to our mobile device team's continued agility in the face of an always volatile market. Looking into the first quarter 2020, we anticipate a relatively normal seasonal sequential decline of approximately 25%. And for the full year 2020, we expect sales in the mobile device market to be flat with 2019 levels. Although 2019 was a difficult year for this market after our record performance in 2018, I can just tell you that we come into 2020 in a great position to capitalize on any future opportunities for growth that may emerge. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices. And while this market will no doubt remain one of the most volatile, our outstanding team working in mobile devices looks forward to continuing to drive value for our customers and for Amphenol into the future. The mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 8% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in this market decreased from prior year by a bit more-than-expected 20% in U.S. dollars and 31% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from both OEMs and operators. As we discussed extensively back in July, the U.S. government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities, ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build-out plans and inventory levels leading to lower demand for our products. For the full year 2019, our sales were down slightly from prior year but were down organically by 9% as the benefits of our acquisitions completed earlier in the year were offset by the dynamics I just mentioned. Looking ahead, while we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels, we do expect sales for the full year to be down in the low single-digits as the full year impact from the U.S. government restrictions as well as the associated effects are partially offset by increased demand from operators who are beginning their next-generation network build-outs. Regardless of the challenges that arose in the mobile networks market in 2019, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers plan for their advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. This creates a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The Information Technology and Data Communications market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year 2019. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected rising by 3% in U.S. dollars, but down by 3% organically from prior year, as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions, together with stronger sales of server-related products were offset by lower sales of products incorporated into networking and storage systems. Sequentially, our sales in IT/datacom grew by a stronger-than-expected 10% from the third quarter, as our team capitalized on stronger demand in servers and storage and, to a lesser extent, networking products. For the full year 2019, our sales in the IT/datacom market were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars and down by 3% organically, a really strong performance by our team, given the impact of the U.S. government restrictions and the associated knock-on effects we discussed earlier. These results were a direct result of our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including in particular high-speed and power products. In addition, our team continued to adapt quickly to the changing market environment, including, by capitalizing on the expanding importance of web service providers, a group of customers that grew strongly in 2019. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from these levels. And for the full year 2020, we anticipate sales to remain flat to 2019 levels, as the full year effect from the U.S. government restrictions are offset by continued growth of next-generation products sold into a wide array of customers, including those web service providers. We remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT/datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT/datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next-generation technologies. Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and the full year. As we had expected, sales decreased by 6% from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by 6%, also from the third quarter. There's no question that 2019 was a challenging year in this market, as our sales declined by 7% from prior year on reduced levels of operator capital spending. Looking ahead, while we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels in the first quarter, for the full year we expect our sales in the broadband market to increase in the low double digits, as operators begin to ramp up their network upgrades. Despite the challenging conditions in the broadband market last year, we remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. We continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit as operators begin to increase network investments. So, just in summary, while 2019 was a challenging year in many respects, I come out of the year extremely proud of our team's performance. Amidst a very uncertain market environment and in the face of many unexpected dynamics that developed during the year, the Amphenol organization has clearly continued to execute extraordinarily well. Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages : our leading technology; our increasing position with customers in diverse markets; our worldwide presence; a lean and flexible cost structure; highly effective acquisition program; and most importantly, our agile entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook and given the continued heightened level of market uncertainty and based of course on constant exchange rates, we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2020 the following. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.85 to $0.87. This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars and 1% to 3% in local currency and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 2% to 4%. For the full year 2020, we expect sales in the range of $8.240 billion to $8.400 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.76 to $3.84. For the full year, this guidance represents both sales growth, represents sales growth of flat to up 2% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1% to 3%. We're encouraged by the company's performance in 2019 and all of us at Amphenol look forward to driving renewed strength going forward into 2020 even amidst the many dynamics around the world. I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our results in 2019 and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : The question and answer period will now begin. Please limit to only question and one follow-up. And the first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question and a follow-up. I guess to start with, when I look at the calendar 2020 EPS guide, I think the implication there is that incremental operating margins are around 5%. I want to make sure A, I'm getting that math right. But if so, what is the delta versus the historical target that you guys have talked about in the 25% range? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Amit. I actually don't think your math is right. If you look at the implied guidance which is the kind of 1% to 3% on the EPS for the full year growth and the 0% to 2% on the revenue growth, what that would really imply is a little bit under our normal kind of conversion margin going into 2020. And I guess I would kind of stress that we really think that's an impressive profitability conversion considering that we still do have some drag related to the acquisitions that we have done. And even though we have made some progress there, we do still have some work to do in regards to some of the acquisitions. As you know there -- they are done throughout the year. So we're not -- there is some time to get those up to the average level of profitability. And -- but if you take those out, actually we're converting well above our normal range. And that would also just reflect the actions that we've taken that aren't reflected at -- the cost of which aren't reflected in 2020 as well as other actions that the company's really done a great job of to ensure the bottom line profitability and really these low rates of organic growth that we're guiding to in 2020. So, really happy with the conversion and ultimate profitability implied in our guide. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you for that. And I guess Adam, on mobile devices, when we think about the flat guide for calendar 2020 sales and I realize it's early in the year for you guys. Just help me understand the delta between the guide here versus what you guys did last year or guided for last year. Does that essentially reflect that you don't see any negative change to your allocation opportunity in calendar 2020? Is that really the message there? Or is there a bigger message in them, which is the content will be as well in calendar 2020? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well thank you Amit. And I think every year we get into that discussion about our guidance for mobile devices with good reason. It's a very difficult market to guide to and you'll remember our -- my track record over a number of years is not the greatest at being accurate. All that being said, we came into last year with an outlook of being down in the mid to high or high teens. And in fact we ended up even though we adjusted the guidance down early in the year but our team ended up really doing a great job in the second half and ended up for the year down in mobile devices by 20% and in fact 19% in local currencies. So, we're kind of spot on last year, which was the first in a many year period. I think our flat guidance is based on what we see today. I think our team has done an excellent job of positioning ourselves well, making sure that we're present on lots of different new platforms that we're getting at least our fair share if not more than our fair share of a variety of allocations and that we're working on lots and lots of different mobile devices. And I think that last point is a very important one. People talk a lot about mobile devices in terms of just a phone or a smartphone or something like that. But there is an extraordinary array of devices more and more, which becomes smart devices and ultimately one calls them a mobile device. I mean, I was just as you know out in Las Vegas a week and a half ago at the Consumer Electronics Show and seeing that essentially everything has become smart. You cannot find a category of a thing that one uses in one's life and not find at the Consumer Electronics Show a smart version thereof. And these smart devices ranging from frying pans to drink mixers to things you put on your wrist to exercising devices and of course to smartphones and tablets, laptops, wearables, headphones, all of those things these continue to create new and wonderful opportunities for our company to find ways to grow as our products can help our customers make their products better. And that remains. And I'd just remind everybody our philosophy in mobile devices, our philosophy remains that we will participate in those products where we can help our customers add value. And just the constant growth of the types of products that are out there, I think creates a good opportunity for us. All that being said, it's a very volatile market. It's a very, very hard to predict market. And as we sit here today just in the third week of January of 2020 flat is what we see. And you can bet our team will do everything they can to capitalize on any incremental opportunities that may arise. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and I had a question and a follow-up as well. I guess first on the macroeconomic environment. Adam, you talked about how some of the events that transpired in 2019 around export bans and tariffs caused some challenges in revenue in certain markets and certainly understand some of those factors remain in place today. But with the phase one trade agreement being put in place between the U.S. and China, are you seeing that translate into improved order rates in any areas? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean look we're very happy if the world's two largest economies can work their way towards a more peaceful coexistence economically. And so I think from that perspective, we applaud that there is this Phase one deal in a very macro standpoint. All that being said, if you look at really what the Phase one deal really means, it does not roll back for example the vast majority of tariffs. And you'll remember well Mark, List 1, List 2, List 3. I mean, those tariffs are all still in place and those are tariffs that our team has done a fabulous job of managing through in 2019, and before, and we'll continue to manage through them going into this year. The restrictions that are really part of a national security discussion as opposed to part of the trade discussion, none of those restrictions have really gone away. So, I wouldn't say that there are tangible benefits of the Phase 1. But I think there's a huge intangible long term, which I very much applaud, which is that it's progress. And hopefully that will lead to more progress, which will lead to really resolving some of the more insidious parts of the trade war that have gone on so far. Mark Delaney : Got it, that's helpful. My follow-up question was around the margin integration topic that was previously discussed. And maybe you can help us understand or remind us, how long it typically takes to integrate acquisitions in past situations? And then along those lines, I remember in 2019, there were some higher-than-normal integration spending that was done, and to Amphenol's credit does not strip that out of non-GAAP earnings. But are there any higher-than-normal integration expenses that are planned in 2020 SG&A that's may be a part of that margin conversion rate that was mentioned? Thanks. Craig Lampo : Yes, sure. Actually I'll start off with this kind of second part of your question first. I guess, I wouldn't -- these weren't -- these costs that we talked about in the third quarter really had nothing to do with integration spend related to acquisitions. It really is related to the fact that based on the current demand levels and that we saw coming into the third and fourth quarter that we -- our general managers around the world those that really saw a reduction these are the things that we talked about really had adjusted their cost levels. And there's -- in some cases this means headcount-related activities and there's a cost to that. And that's really what we saw in the third quarter, that isn't recurring neither in the fourth quarter really of any significance nor in our expectation from a guide perspective in 2020. I mean, I say that with a caveat that that's based on the current demand environment. If there was some sort of an additional drop down or step down in the current demand environment, of course, we would take quick action and there could be some costs related to that. But certainly that's not our expectation and not included in our guidance. In terms of the margins in regards to acquisitions and how long it takes us to get those margins up to the company average, I guess, I would say that it really is very dependent on the specific acquisitions. Over the course of history, we've had ones as short as months and three to six months or so as it relates to companies like FCI and others that we've had. And then we've had to take -- some have taken years, and it really just depends. So I wouldn't necessarily say that I would nail down and say it's within one. There was a median to that or anything of that nature. So, -- but we are -- I think we have a pretty good track record in regarding to doing that. The management team is very committed to getting the margins up over some period of time, and we do have an expectation. With that being said, there will be a bit of a drag on our margin in 2020, albeit not as significant as there was in 2019. And if you look at our 2020 sequential margins kind of going throughout the year in terms of implied guidance where we start in the first quarter in terms of where we end up for 2020, you would see that there is expectation of some improvement which is partly from acquisitions and partly from just the underlying actions that we take from an organic perspective. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Adam I appreciate your comments around mobile devices, but just normal seasonality would imply mobile devices would be up quite significantly on a year-on-year basis. So, should we conclude that there's just not enough visibility at this point to make that statement about how those trends are going to be at the back half of the year? Or do you actually expect seasonality to be sort of sub-seasonal this year? And I have a follow-up. Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean I don't know that the normal seasonality -- I mean normal is what in the mobile devices. There -- we -- I think our guidance would imply that there is still a strong second half pickup in our sales in the mobile devices in 2020. Is it as strong as it was this year? No, but I think that if you look this year from Q4 to Q1, we were down by more than 50%. And so every year in mobile devices has a little bit of a different cadence across the quarters depending on how things go. We had that extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018. We then had a very significant, more than half reduction sequentially into Q1 of 2019. This quarter, we anticipate a relatively modest sequential reduction in the first quarter; let's call it a more normal sequential reduction in the kind of mid-20s. And so I wouldn't say that there is any sort of big categorical difference in terms of how that cadence goes throughout the year. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks Adam. And then we've seen some semiconductor companies talk about a near-term bottom-end demand in place. I'm wondering if you view any lead-time movement indicating anything similar for you or how you would categorize the broader demand environment as you're entering this year. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean I'm not maybe as good at finding where are bottoms and where are tops. And part of that may be because distribution is a relatively small proportion of our sales and I think there are plenty of companies who have relatively high distribution content who maybe see that a little bit more clearly on sell-throughs and inventory levels and all that's associated with distribution. I think the overall demand environment remains very uncertain. I'm pleased with how our team did in the fourth quarter. I'm especially pleased that we had a positive book-to-bill in the fourth quarter which gives me some sense of confidence. At the same time there are a few of our markets where the first half of last year has a very difficult comparison to the first half of this year. And for one I would point out mobile networks where clearly we will see in the first half of this year because of all the dynamics that we already have discussed a few times, we'll see that market being down relatively significantly in the first half and that has some impact on the overall outlook for the year. But are we at a bottom? I think it really depends by market. And I think it's not always easy for us sitting where we sit to pick are we or are we not at the bottom. Operator : The next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes. Thank you. First question Adam, just on the automotive market. If you can just touch on kind of from a production perspective, how you're seeing things at the start of this year? And then you mentioned a couple of new programs. So any highlights you call out from a content perspective that are important for this year? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I think the auto market clearly as we went through the course of last year and we talked about this a lot in the middle of the year, we did not see a recovery in the auto market that we had anticipated would have come in the second half. And that ultimately kept our performance more muted than we would have liked. Now all that being said, I think that we were in the fourth quarter as I mentioned flat on an organic basis. For the full year, just down by a very small amount organically. And that's in a worldwide automotive market, where you probably know the numbers better than I do, but I think it's like 6%, 7% volumes down. I think there's lots of different forecasts for what the automotive market will be in 2020, but none of them seem to be so rosy in terms of the outlook. I think our team, we don't go about forecasting our business by saying what is production and what is content. But I think very clearly with our outlook to grow in the low single digits in 2020, I think that continues to represent gains in content by the company. And as it relates to new programs I mean, we are always working on lots of new programs that in particular are dealing with new electronic systems in the car things like electric drivetrains, things like new emission systems, things like new passenger comfort and infotainment systems and when we looked at our performance in the fourth quarter that was not clearly driven on a sequential basis, where we grew 3% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That was not driven by auto volumes. That was really driven by some of these new programs that we've been working hard on for a number of years starting to ramp-up. And we would expect to see some of that to continue into 2020. Craig Hettenbach : Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on mobile networks you talked about just some of the uncertainty kind of a ripple through effect of the Huawei restrictions. Any signals you're getting from operators in terms of just how they're feeling about the pacing through this year? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, operators don't give you the longest-term forecasts. And that's one of the things about being in the service provider market. And we know how to work in service provider markets. We've gotten very good at it over the years. And forecasting in the service provider market is not so easy. And I think the operators are -- some of them are still of the mind to say, let's wait and see how this whole thing shakes out vis-\u00e0-vis which vendors can we use and not use in particular in places outside of the U.S. I think in the U.S., the problem does -- isn't related necessarily to that, because that's pretty well defined. But it's more in the U.S. you continue to have uncertainties around corporate combinations and the sort of is the equipment ready? And is the economics around 5G there to support significant investment increases? And I think those are still yet to be seen. But look we expect in 2020 to see some next-generation network build-out not enough to offset the comparisons that I talked about in one of the prior questions. But certainly we do expect to see that with some of our operator customers around the world. And to the extent that, they decide to accelerate those or that the economics become more clear or the supply base becomes more clear, we will be right there to support them whenever they need us. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Happy New Year to you guys as well. If I can just clarify, I think you said industrial segment you expect growth in 2020. Is that an expectation on the organic sales as well? And if so kind of which are the geographies you're seeing improving trends? And what's your latest assessment of the inventory situation there? Adam Norwitt : Yes. So, I think the answer is yes we expect some modest amount of organic growth in the year in industrial. I think across which segments, it's a little hard to say that in advance. No doubt about it. I mean we had good momentum in industrial finishing the year in instrumentation, alternative energy and medical. I mean those all seem to have continued outlooks of favorability but it's very hard to forecast which of the many segments of the industrial market are going to ultimately drive the result. Relative to distribution and the sort of stock positions and all of that I think we did see over the course of the year in 2019, relatively significant reductions in industrial distribution between the first half and the second half. I don't say that we have a big recovery for that embedded into our numbers. I think a lot of distributors are waiting and seeing to see ultimately when is the end demand going to come back in those markets which they serve. All that being said, what we feel very good about in the industrial market beyond just our core position we've made some outstanding acquisitions over the course of the last year, which have really built our product offering and our penetration into those various segments of the industrial market in a really significant way. And so our team is working very hard around the world to leverage those new product offerings to make sure that we can continue to become ever more important to our customers. And to the extent those customers ultimately have more demand to fulfill I think that will be a real tough choice for them to work with in 2020 and beyond. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. And if I can just follow-up on the cash flow. Craig, how are you thinking about kind of operating cash flow for 2020 given that you had a sizable improvement here going from 2018 to 2019? Are there more kind of working capital benefits that we should expect in a flat operating profit environment in 2020? Craig Lampo : Sure. Thanks. No, I mean the company certainly has historically been and continues to have a very strong cash flow generation. And I think in years where the organic growth is a little bit lower such as 2019, we would expect to generate stronger-than-average cash flow versus those years that we grow really strongly organically such as 2018, where the cash flow is a little bit lower than the average. I guess what I would say about the expectation 2020, is I wouldn't expect any significant change from kind of the average cash flow conversion that we typically have. It's -- so I would expect that same kind of rough within the range of 100% of net income free cash flow conversion in the 90 -- mid-90s, maybe, in that range and over 100% kind of from an operating cash flow perspective, which basically is what we're going to expect over the longer term from a cash flow generation perspective. But I would tell you that we're extremely happy about the cash flow generation. And, in 2019, we certainly deployed that, given all the acquisitions that we had and certainly the share repurchases. So, I think, it's really a strategic advantage of the company, generating this level of cash. And I think the 2019 cash flow that we generated was just an example of that. We're really proud of that. Operator : The next question is from Shawn Harrison from Longbow. Your line is now open. Shawn Harrison : Afternoon, everybody. Double-digit growth in the broadband business is something, I guess, I haven't heard for a while. So, maybe Adam, if you could delve into why the operators are finally looking to spend here in 2020. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Shawn, sorry, either I misspoke or you misheard, because I said -- I think, I said low single-digit growth in broadband. So, I apologize for that, if it was my misstatement. Shawn Harrison : Okay. So, low single-digit growth, never mind on that. Adam Norwitt : Which is still good, given the last two years. Shawn Harrison : Correct, correct, considering the history. Okay. Then moving on. Then the IT/datacom business is flattish organic growth. If you exclude the entity ban impact, where would you expect to see organic growth in that business in 2020? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, that's a little bit hard to say. I think, we feel very good about our position in that -- in the IT/datacom market. Clearly, the first half has a more magnified impact, because of the various effects. And it's not just the ban itself, but also the knock-on effects that we discussed, I think, pretty extensively back in our second quarter discussion. So, I -- what would it be organically? I don't know, low single digits, something like that. If I sit where I sit today, which is the very beginning of the year, thinking about a market that is not always the easiest to forecast, maybe something like that around those levels. But no doubt about it. There are parts of that market where we continue to make great progress irregardless of what's happening in the overall environment. And I mentioned, our progress that we've made in web service providers, which had really great growth last year, double-digit growth organically, in an environment where those customers, that part of the IT datacom world is really striving for a real step function increase in bandwidth and processor capability, in order to support just all what is being supported, a lot of which is, as you know, very well, getting people to watch videos on their phones and tablets and over-the-top on their TVs at home. And that extraordinary increase in video traffic continues to drive just a lot of demand for the next-generation higher speed products. So, what will that ultimately be, it's hard to say at this stage. I think, the guidance that we've given to be flat for the year is a very good guidance, given all the dynamics. And, obviously, our team is going to work very hard to outperform that if they can. Operator : The next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you. And hello, Adam and Craig. A question, Adam, regarding your sensor business. You seem pretty excited about that small acquisition in India. You've made several acquisitions over the years. And, I know, there's a mix between both industrial and auto. Could you update us on where you stand there in terms of revenue run rate, the end market mix? And also, how much are you seeing in terms of traction with doing complete subsystems for customers that include both the sensor and interconnect technologies? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Matt. Look, we are very excited about our sensor business. And yes, it's a very small acquisition and maybe I sound a little more excited than the scale of it. And I think, the reason for that is a few-fold. Number one, it is our first acquisition that we've made in India of a private company. And it gives us a new base of low-cost manufacturing at a time when diversification of low cost seems to be not a bad idea in many respects. And I think this EXA will really be a fabulous space for us to support the world which they do already. And in addition, it gives us really a direct on-the-ground access to the Indian market for sensors, which we have not had before. So, that's something that's very new. And we would really anticipate in the future that that team will become a beachhead for us in a very, very important market in particular in the industrial market, but also in automotive, military and otherwise. In terms of where do we stand in our scale in sensors, we're a lot bigger than we were before. We don't talk publicly about exactly what the size of our sensors is. But you can piece that together relatively well by looking at the disclosed sizes of all of our acquisitions and knowing that we've grown our sensor business organically at a relatively robust pace during that time period. What do we look forward to in terms of that sort of value-add offering? I can tell you that now that we are six years in to having owned our first sensor company which was the GE Advanced Sensor acquisition, we see a lot of opportunities with customers to give them a total solution of interconnect and sensor products, which ultimately allows them to simplify their approach to their vendor base, to have one company on whom they can rely for that total system and especially a company that has that harsh environment capabilities that we have had for so many decades, in fact the whole history of Amphenol. And I think that that proposition, which was originally more of a hypothesis when we acquired the Advanced Sensors Business six years ago is clearly a platform for us for long-term growth in the sensor and the interconnect market. And we look forward to taking advantage of that for many years to come. Matt Sheerin : Okay, very good. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks a lot. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Matt. Operator : The next question is from Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Will Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong Q4 results including the inventory performance. That said, Adam, I'm wondering if you can comment on inventory conditions in the channel? I know you're not a huge user of the channel, but any view into that category's inventory levels and similarly at your direct customers, any visibility that you could comment on? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I think the inventory conditions in the channel again it's a relatively small proportion of our sales just 15% of our sales through distribution. And we get some visibility across that 15%. I'd say that the inventory positions are healthy. I would say that they are relative to the end demand of the market. So, we have some proportion of our distribution which is in the military market, where there's very robust demand and where we've done a great job of satisfying that demand. And so maybe inventories have come a little bit up in that area. And conversely we've seen them come a little bit down in areas like the industrial market. But I wouldn't point to any significant disruptions that we would see there in inventory. Relative to our direct customers there's no question and we talked about this in the middle of the year that our customers following in particular after the events of the second quarter between the U.S. and China, a number of our customers looked at their overall inventory position and decided that maybe they had a little too much. And I'd say that those positions as best as we can tell because we don't have any visibility that's a real visibility. But at least the anecdotal evidence is that they -- those positions are working down and to a little bit more of a healthy environment. Will Stein : That's helpful. If I could have one more, I want to revisit the mobile device end market again. I know this is very difficult to forecast. So, you've provided us with a view that's flat year-over-year. But there are some pretty big architecture changes coming this year or at least those are anticipated relative to 5G, certainly maybe Wi-Fi 6 we'll see more of that as well. And these architectural changes drive potential for step function different content from various companies including Amphenol. I'm wondering when we should expect to hear about any update. Or when does Amphenol have some better visibility into what the content situation looks like? Is that during Q1 event, during Q2? Any clarity on that would help. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, look we always struggle with this here in the first quarter Will as you know coming up with a guidance and knowing when we have clarity. I think we usually have decent clarity at least in our design-in position sometime into the second quarter. But look I think the guidance that we've given is based on a very, very rigorous look at all of our design-in positions and the outlooks from the customers, obviously, taking some with grains of salt. In terms of the next-generation architectures I mean the good news about these architectural changes whether that be 5G, whether that be Wi-Fi 6 or something else the good news about them is they tend to stack on each other as opposed to replace something else because if you take 5G as an example, you will not buy a phone if it only works for 5G. You will not buy a tablet if it only works for 5G, because the 5G networks are going to be relatively minimalistic up until -- for a number of years to come. And thus it has to be an additional functionality in that device, which has then backwards compatibility to 4G network, LTE to 3G. And you know what sometimes you're driving through a part of the country and some of those parts of the country seem to even be in Connecticut where you don't even have 3G. You have 2G or Edge or whatever they have to call it. And phone got to work. You've got to be able to call 911. You got to be able to make at least a phone call even if you cannot watch your Netflix movie at the same time. And because of that these devices become more complex. They may add some type of architecture of 5G whether its antenna or the whole signal path associated with it. But ultimately it increases the complexity, which creates opportunities for us all things being equal. Now, I say all things being equal because every new device has a different cut of how they're going to architect it a different approach and that's why you have to be so flexible and dynamic and innovative as a supplier into that market. But I think those are things that our team has really nailed down for many, many years. And so what that 5G will bring, I think at a minimum it doesn't make things worse. And can it create opportunities? I think certainly it can. And the same goes with something like a Wi-Fi 6, which maybe will slowly take over for the higher speeds that it entails and that can create new opportunities for us over the long-term. Operator : The next question is from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good afternoon Adam and Craig. Adam question for you first. Do you -- overall, do you feel fundamentally better about the macro environment than you did three months or six months ago? And does the guidance contemplate some of the cycle recovery prospects in automotive, industrial or semis? I mean you touched on this earlier, but my question is, does the guidance -- does the guide contemplate any sort of recovery expectations similar to what you might have seen in prior historical cycle recoveries? Adam Norwitt : Well, to your first question do I feel better than three to six months ago? Yes, I mean, six months ago was not the most fun having dealt with everything that we faced in Q2 and a relatively sudden impact of the restrictions and the various aspects of the trade war and other knock-on effects. So, yes, I guess, I feel fundamentally better than I did at that time. Does our guide contemplate a recovery? I think arithmetically you can apply some sort of normal seasonalities and see that, yes, I mean, our second half is assumed to have some growth compared to the first half. Now, that's not so odd for us. We do typically have a second half that's stronger than the first half. We had that in this last year. Even without the impact of the acquisitions, there was growth in the second half. But I think that for sure we have some expectation. Is that a recovery with a capital R? Or is that a normalization? Or is that us also expanding our position on a variety of new programs? I would call it a good combination of all of the above. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. My follow-up is with Craig. Craig, does the full year EPS guidance contemplate share buybacks? You've always talked about free cash -- a third of free cash flow being deployed towards share buybacks where possible. In the recent past you've done 50% or more the last few years, but you've got this M&A going on which I understand. But what's embedded in the full year 2020 guide? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yes. Sure. Thanks Deepa. Yes. So the 2020 guide does reflect some small level of repurchases that we would expect to do under normal course. So, I guess, I would also say that also what it reflects is that our share price is where it is. And not to get into the dynamics of how weighted average shares are calculated, but there is an impact when the share price is higher that actually increases your weighted average shares that does have some offsetting impact to the share repurchases. So, I guess in terms of how we would think about that is that there is some impact of both of those reflected in our guidance. Operator : The next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Joseph Spak : Thanks for fitting me in here. I just wanted to quickly go back to the guidance. If we look at both the first quarter and the full year revenue guidance at the midpoint, it's about 1%, yet the guidance would imply the margins are a little bit softer in the first quarter than maybe the rest of the year. I know there could be some seasonality or maybe mix related, but is there anything specific we should be thinking about or what gets that higher in later in the year? Craig Lampo : Yes. No, I think the margin in the first quarter I think reflect the fact that we're sequentially organically reducing by the 7-ish -- on the high end the 7%-ish sequential quarter. And that does bring with it a little bit higher than normal conversion. On the downside, we talked about that in 2019 we're maybe close to 30% decline. And we're kind of in the 25% to 30% sequential decline from a conversion perspective into the first quarter which just normally brings with a little bit lower margins. I think if you then look at the full year kind of implied guidance as I mentioned earlier, we do expect some increases there on from that maybe even a little bit higher than typical going into the rest of the year which again as I mentioned before, reflects work that we're doing in the base business as well as maybe some progress from an acquisition profitability perspective. Joseph Spak : Thanks. And just as a follow-up on aerospace. You mentioned the 737 MAX as a headwind. I guess technically you were more diplomatic. I guess I just mentioned it. But can you just give us some indication of what you're really considering there in your guidance just so as we continue to follow the news and headlines there track how it should impact your outlook? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean look I think first of all for the overall outlook of the company, there's not a program including the one you mentioned that is material to our overall outlook. But in that market commercial air which did represent for us for the full year just 5% of sales, one significant program can have some modest impact on your outlook and that's what I had here. I mean our overall presumption is consistent with probably what everybody has read publicly in terms of timing. And I wouldn't say much more than that. Operator : The next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you and Happy New Year to you and your team. And I have one question that is actually kind of the same question for both Adam and Craig. And that is as you look at 2020, what's kind of maybe the two or three variables or swing factors or end markets or items that you're really focused on? Maybe A for Adam on the sales side and then B for the profitability side for Craig. Like for example does the integration cost really something you're really focused on from a margin perspective or the challenges in the aerospace or mobility for the sales side? I'm just trying to figure out what the top couple variables that you're kind of most keenly focused on for 2020 that could directionally go much better or potentially be some more risk? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Jim and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, I mean two variables end markets I mean we are focused really on making sure the company performs regardless of what risks emerge for us. I think we saw in 2019 many things that came about that we did not anticipate. And to categorize in advance well that could happen or this could happen, that's not how we operate the business. The way we operate the business is we try to be prepared regardless. And so I can tell you that, our team fully expects that in 2020 there maybe unexpected external things that happen and occasionally some of those external things that happen can have some sort of effect on Amphenol, and it's up to our team to really make sure that that doesn't have any financial harm to the company. And what you see in our results in 2019 is clearly that our team sprung into action quickly, dealt with whatever came our way, managed effectively and ultimately brought the company out of 2019 in a stronger position than we had come into it. And I think that's the whole mantra for Amphenolians worldwide is we cannot necessarily control the environment, but we can control our agility in the face of that environment. And that's true inside of each of our markets. If in military there were a decline in spending, well, our team would deal with it. We would manage it. And by the way, we would have just outstanding presence with customers who we have pleased so well during the course of this latest expansion, we would do a fabulous job of that. We just talked about aerospace. I mean in the industrial market, we have such a great position now because of the acquisitions that we've made and the various new product developments that we are ready for whichever end market goes up, and we're ready to deal with it, if there is something that would happen within those segments that would not be as favorable. And I could go through each of the markets in that way. I wouldn't say that, any of our markets sitting here where we sit has a different kind of risk of something external happening. I would of course say that, some of our markets are a little easier to predict than others. The mobile devices being the one that's the hardest to predict on one side and maybe the military being the one that is a little bit more certain because of the length of the lead times and the spending patterns. But I didn't answer your question in terms of two variables, but I can tell you that our team is focused on dealing with any variable that would come our way. And then maybe Craig, I'll let you talk about the -- Craig Lampo : Yes, yes. No, sure. I guess, there's a lot of things obviously have to be thinking about as we move into 2020. I mean, one of them will continue to be our acquisitions and bringing the profitability level up to the average of the company. I mean, we did 10 acquisitions over the last 13 months here and certainly met more before that. And we are continuing to spend a lot of time to ensure that we're making the right decisions and helping those operations make those decisions to ensure that ultimately we get to that -- to get those profitability levels up. And that's something I probably will spend the disproportionate share of my time on and along with all the other things that would typically do during the year that some of which Adam just mentioned in his prior comments. So, anyways, again, I apologize for not talking about many, many different things, because we probably be on the phone for way too long here. But from an M&A perspective that will continue to be one of the things, I'll spend time on. Jim Suva : Thank you for the answers. And we hope you also have a great 2020. Adam Norwitt : Likewise, Jim. Operator : The next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is now open. David Kelley : Hey, good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in. Just one quick follow-up on the earlier automotive discussion, I'll pass it along. With CO2 emissions regulations ramping this year, are you seeing any meaningful change in content opportunity in Europe as customers are shifting their mix to electric vehicles? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, I think David that all these regulations whether they be CO2 emissions regulations, whether it be like PM2.5 kind of regulations, Euro VI, the China version thereof, I mean, all these regulations tend to create dislocations which requires then new technology solutions to meet with those regulations. And I think by and large, those are always great inflection points for our organization to take advantage of them with our new enabling technologies. And so, I wouldn't just confine it to that universe of CO2 emissions in Europe, but rather just broadly as we see more regulatory impact in the automotive market, those do create opportunities long term and one that our team is well positioned to take advantage of. We've done a great job on working in electric drivetrain over -- around the world. The biggest market for electric drivetrains has been at least so far in China and that's a place where our team has just done a fabulous job of positioning ourselves. So, it's really great harsh environment, high-power interconnect solutions. But that's something we're doing really around the world. And so from that sort of micro example of electric drivetrains, we're very well positioned. Each platform, you can't say that universally it is a positive when something goes from a combustion to an electric drivetrain. But by and large technological shifts like this are good because they create those inflection points and opportunities for new technology. Operator : The next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is now open. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Joe. Craig Lampo : Hey, Joe. Joe Giordano : Hey, I'm sorry not sure if you watch Curb Your Enthusiasm but Larry David said it's too late to wish people Happy New Year, you have three days he said, so just let you guys know. Adam Norwitt : Let\u2019s do it in Valentine's Day, Joe. Joe Giordano : Just for me to start on the Huawei restrictions is there -- how do you view the risk of permanent share loss to like local supply if that was like lifted over the next couple months? Like is that a market that we should think comes back for you guys? Or is it just -- it's been fulfilled locally that's unlikely to change again? Adam Norwitt : Look I mean I think it's a broader question and it's one that we've I think talked about in prior calls which is not even just specific to one customer but is there a kind of a nationalistic purchasing that can happen in the world including in China but not exclusive to China, because of the nature of the various trade disputes that have happened over the last two or three years. And I think what I've said consistently and we continue to absolutely maintain is that it may happen that the world becomes a more local world as opposed to a globalizing world and our team is ready for that regardless. And I think that's the real essence of how we operate in China, how we operate in India, how we operate in the U.S. or elsewhere, as we do that with local teams who give real localized support for their customers. And because of that the original restrictions we were able to work through them and continue to support customers because we're not exporting technology. We're complying obviously with every law from the first minute those laws are implemented. But our teams are really developing, supporting, covering the customer, ensuring the quality doing everything in a local fashion really around the world. And so to the extent that one day, one country decides that they're not going to buy from just American companies, we're still an American company. But I can tell you that our people are giving local support as if they were a Chinese, an Indian, a Macedonian, a German company as well. And that's a real differentiator for our company. And so, as long as we can offer our customers truly special products that ultimately solve their problems and if we do that in a localized way, I'm confident that we'll be able to minimize any impacts from any of the geopolitical dynamics that have gone on here during the course of these last few years. Joe Giordano : And then -- that's helpful. And then, last for me on the device. I know, we talked about device a lot. I just want to make sure I'm clear on something. When you're -- when you say you're -- it's impossible to figure out like a guide for this, I fully get that. But is your uncertainty at this point in the year around volumes of those phones that might ultimately be produced, or whether or not you're on these platforms in the first place? Is that still like in front of you? I know a major company is coming out with something in March and then multiple later in the year? Like, do you know if you're on those? Or is it just, we don't know what the volumes -- have no idea what the volumes are going to be? Adam Norwitt : Yes. It can be -- at this early in the year, it can be a combination of all of the above. I mean, our team is working on new programs all the time. But sometimes those programs they change pretty soon before they're released. You'd be surprised how dynamic the designs of consumer products can be and so you're not fixed until they're really starting to build the things and ship them in volume. And so, our team continues to work very hard to maximize what our position is. In January, where we sit, it's not so easy to be able to tell exactly what's going to happen, even if we have a pretty good read on it, as good as we can have here in January. But look no doubt about it, our team has demonstrated the flexibility that we're going to go out there and win absolutely everything that we can possibly win. We're going to maximize our allocation given the -- our discipline on cost and on price. And we're going to make sure that we can execute on whatever our customers put in front of us. Operator : Our last question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fox : Hi. Good afternoon. I just had one big picture question, Adam. If I think about the organic sales growth decline you had in the quarter, I would imagine there's a lot of other companies in the fragmented industry getting in that are doing a lot worse. So, on one hand, I guess, I'm wondering, what you think about some of the smaller companies, how much they're struggling now, if it's temporary or secular? And then on the other hand, given that you're looking for no growth again in earnings this year and I understand the broadband comments and the positive trend there, maybe, in the second half. But, like, when do we start thinking about this market as being the market you have to live with and maybe see a change in strategy? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, look, I mean, how are other companies doing here in the fourth quarter, smaller companies. I can tell you, if you don't have the diversity of Amphenol, if you don't have the reach of Amphenol, the breadth and the balance of Amphenol, the depth of technology, 2019 is not an easy year. There's no doubt about it. So, I can imagine that that could have been a tough year for many much tougher than what we saw. I mean, you look at our whole performance for the year; we were down by 3% organically in the year. That is essentially the impact of mobile devices. I mean, mobile devices was down 20% for the full year and it was 17% of our sales in 2018. Just the math of it, is that represents just a bit more than 3% organic growth. All the other markets start to balance themselves out. And I think that's a testament to the diversification of the company. Now, look, going into 2020, I can't hear you perfectly, Steve. But what I think you said is that we don't have earnings growth this year, but we have guided to 1% to 3% earnings growth and 0% to 2% U.S. dollar growth this year. And I think if we go back a year ago, it's not materially different than the guidance that we had coming into 2019. I think it's a prudent guidance. It's a guidance that reflects the still highly uncertain environment and it's one that also reflects great efforts by the team to drive cost improvements, to drive value with our customers and ultimately to drive a strong performance. And to the extent that there are opportunities for us to do better than that environment in the year, you can bet full well that everybody around Amphenol, all 74,000 of us are going to jump on those opportunities with full vigor and energy and thereby execute on them. So, I think it's actually a very strong outlook from that perspective, given the overall environment that we're in and the strong conversion as Craig talked about. Steve Fox : Okay. Thank you. Sorry for the bad connection. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. Operator, are there any more questions? Operator : We show no further questions at this time. Adam Norwitt : That's wonderful. Well, thank you, all very much. And again, despite Joe's reference, I will once more wish you all a Happy New Year and wish in particular that you have a great start to 2020. And we look forward to speaking with you all again here in about 90 days. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. But before I review the financial performance for the quarter, Adam would like to say a few words. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much Craig. And first and foremost, I wanted to express my hope to everybody that's here on the phone today that you and your family, your friends and your colleagues are all staying safe and healthy amidst the current COVID-19 crisis. As Craig just mentioned, I'm going to comment on the current environment. I'll discuss also some of our highlights from the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Craig to provide further detail on our financial performance. And then finally, I'll come back to me to discuss the trends and progress across our served markets, and I'll make a few comments about the future.  No question that we're living in truly unprecedented times as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all of us around the world in really extraordinary ways. Here at Amphenol, our first priority from the earliest day has been to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employers, our suppliers, our customers and the many communities in which we operate around the world. And I'm sure that this pandemic has also personally impacted many of you on the phone here today just like it has really everyone around the world. Our company began to see the impacts from the outbreak at the time of the government restrictions that were imposed by China starting with the shutdown of Wuhan on January 23rd. While we don't have any facilities in Wuhan, our team successfully navigated an unprecedented three weeks shutdown of our 50 manufacturing operations in China. And I just wanted to mention here how truly proud I am of our entire China team, who were able to return to full production level by the beginning of March, substantially earlier than we had originally expected. As the COVID-19 virus has continued to spread around the world, Amphenol\u2019s entire global team has been focused on executing amidst very challenging market conditions and quickly evolving government measures to control the pandemic, all whilst clearly prioritizing the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  To that end, we early on proactively instituted significant measures to protect our employees, which has ultimately enabled us as a company to continue to operate throughout this pandemic. I'm truly proud of the Amphenol organization who despite these unprecedented conditions have continued to execute as Amphenolians always do, including by supporting our communities around the world when they need us the most. We've donated hundreds of thousands of masks to local hospitals, reconditioned machines to produce our own face mask, dedicated 3D printers to help make face shield, significantly expanded our production of components used in ventilators and other critical equipment and ramped up the capacity of our high speed and power product to support the expanded bandwidth needs around the world. And these are just a few of the many, many initiatives that have been taken by our more than 120 operations around the world. And I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our Amphenol employees around the world for their dedication, resolve, agility and focus amidst this most challenging and uncertain times.  Now turning to the first quarter, as I'm sure you all well know, due to the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 24th, we withdrew our first quarter guidance that had been issued at the time of our January earnings release. Despite this, I'm very proud of the results that the company has ultimately achieved in this uniquely challenging quarter. Our sales reached $1.862 billion, a reduction of 5% in U.S. dollars versus prior year and 9% organically. And that was driven by lower sales in the mobile devices, mobile networks, IT datacom, automotive and industrial markets. These declines largely related to the COVID-19 disruptions in China, including, in particular, the approximately three weeks shutdown of all of our manufacturing operations in that country. I'm very pleased that the company booked $2.150 billion in orders in the first quarter, and that represented a book-to-bill of 1.15 to 1, the highest level in the modern history of the Corporation. And despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter, adjusted operating margins held up very well, reaching 17%. Amphenol financial position is extremely strong, with operating cash flow of $384 million in the first quarter, supporting the company's excellent liquidity which includes a substanti $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. Craig will give more details on this in a few moments.  Just like to close by saying I'm extremely proud of our team and that our performance this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the truly unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 crisis.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig to review our financial performance and then come back in a few moments to talk about our end markets. Craig, please. Craig Lampo : Thanks a lot, Adam. So as Adam just reviewed the company closed the first quarter with sales of $1.862 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.79 and $0.71 respectively. Sales were down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to first quarter of 2019. And from an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the first quarter decreased 9%.  Sequentially sales were down 13% in U.S. dollars and local currency and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprise 96% of our sales was down 5% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprise 4% of our sales, was down 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on strength by market in few minutes.  Operating income was $317 million for the first quarter of 2020 and operating margin was 17% which was down 310 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, operating margin decreased 300 basis points. The reduction in operating margins reflected a negative conversion rate higher than our typical 30% downside conversion. This elevated conversion was primarily driven by the impact on the first quarter of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to the various government restrictions that limit our ability to adjust payroll costs.  From a segment standpoint, in the Interconnect segment, margins were 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 which was down compared to 22% for both the first and fourth quarters of 2019. In the Cable segment, margins were 7.6% which is down compared to 11% in the first quarter of 2019 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Despite the year-over-year and sequential operating margin decline, we are proud of this quarter's performance given the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's ability to minimize the negative margin impact from this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's enterpreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in an uncertain market environment.  Interest expense for the quarter was $29 million which compares to $30 million in the first quarter last year. And the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 excluded a discrete tax benefit of $20 million due to refunds in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and the resulting adjustments to deferred taxes, as well as an excess tax benefit of $5 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of acquisition related costs partially offset by the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 including the items just mentioned was 15.9% compared to 22.8% in first quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was a strong 12% of sales in the first quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance.  On a GAAP basis diluted EPS declined by 9% in the first quarter to $0.79, compared to $0.87 in the first quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 20% to $0.71 in the first quarter of 2020 from $0.89 in the first quarter of 2019.  As Adam mentioned, orders for the quarter were $2.150 billion, which was up 7% compared to the first quarter of 2019, resulting in a record book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 to 1. Despite the extremely challenging environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $384 million in the first quarter or 177% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending of $61 million, our free cash flow was $323 million or 149% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion and $817 million respectively at the end of March. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 92, 75 and 57 days respectively. While DSO and DPO were both in the normal range, DSI was slightly elevated due to the lower sales levels in the first quarter, which were driven primarily by the extended shutdown of production in China as well as the production challenges in other parts of the world. Due to the current crisis, we do expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, while sales levels are depressed, but to come back down to normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty -- significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets during the first quarter of 2020. As a result and as mentioned in our earnings release, as an abundance of caution, in late March, the company proactively bought $1.25 billion under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. In addition, due to the significant volatility in the commercial paper markets, the company decided to reduce its reliance on the public commercial paper markets, and as such, approximately half of the proceeds from the revolving credit facility is allocated to repay amounts due under our commercial paper programs. During the first quarter our cash flow from operations of $384 million along with net proceeds from our various credit facilities of $1.36 billion, proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $400 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $30 million were used primarily to repurchase $257 million of the company's stock at an average price approximately $96, fund repayments under our commercial paper programs of $250 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditure of $60 million, fund acquisitions of $16 million and fund distributions to and purchases of non-controlling interests of $8 million. At March 31st cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion was held in the U.S. This elevated level of cash was driven by $400 million on hand from proceeds of the February bond offering, which was subsequently used to fund the $400 million bond maturity at due on April 1st. And the previously noted drawdown of our credit facilities in excess of our current or expected cash needs in order to fund the decision to reduce our reliance on the commercial paper market and to provide a cash buffer during this period of extreme market volatility. At March 31st there was $1.36 billion outstanding under our credit facilities as well as $138 million of outstanding commercial paper remaining that will come due in April and be repaid with cash on hand. As a result, total debt at March 31st was $5.1 billion and net debt at March 31 was $2.7 billion which was unchanged from the net debt level as of December 31, 2019.  Total cash on hand as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.6 billion at the end of the quarter which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The first quarter 2020 EBITDA was $403 million and the pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.4 times.  In summary, although this was certainly a much more challenging quarter than we had anticipated coming into the year, we finished the quarter in a position of real financial strength and with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength coupled with company's broad market and geographic diversity positions us well for the current more volatile environment which is characterized by moderating demand and continued uncertainty across global markets.  And with that, I will now turn it over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much Craig. Craig just mentioned the value that we see in the company's balanced and broad end-market diversification. And I can just tell you that, that value is even more clearer in the times like we're living in today. In the quarter, no single end market represented more than 21% of our sales. This diversification continues to mitigate the impact of the volatility of individual end markets and geographies, while also exposing us to leading technologies where ever they may arise across the electronics industry. And this is just a great asset in a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we are experiencing today.  Now turning to our end market, the military market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Sales again few very strongly from prior year increasing by a bit less than expected 18% in the first quarter. And this was driven by growth across virtually all segments of the military market including, in particular, helicopters, space, military vehicles and avionics applications. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 5% from the fourth quarter.  Looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales to decrease from the first quarter level. A certain of our facilities that support military customers are operating with reduced staffing as a result of governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen our position across the market while increasing our capacity to serve customers really in all segments of the military market. The company's continued strong performance is a great reflection of the results of those efforts.  Given the ongoing favourable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demand that we see in support of the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales were down slightly as production volumes declined, and as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers began to experience the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis late in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 10% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the first quarter.  There's no doubt that the commercial air market has been significantly impacted by the rapid and unprecedented reduction in air travel around the world. Accordingly, we do expect a further reduction in sales as customers shutdowns and reduced demand for air travel impacts overall aircraft production volumes. Regardless of the difficult environment that we're seeing in the commercial air market today, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and that positions very well for the long-term. The industrial market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the industrial market declined by approximately 3% as growth in medical instrumentation, alternative energy and battery related applications, together with contributions from our acquisitions completed last year were offset by declining sales related to heavy equipment, rail mass transit, oil and gas as well as other segments. On a sequential basis sales in the industrial market were down more than we expected by about 4% from the fourth quarter and it's reflected in particular the China COVID-19 related shutdown. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight just how proud we are of our team working in the medical segment of our industrial market, who is ramping up our production of sensors, connectors and a wide variety of interconnect assemblies in support of countless applications that are providing medical treatments for COVID-19 patients.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect industrial markets to remain relatively stable, as increases in production in China are offset by lower sales in other geographies related to some of the restrictions on production that we're now seeing. We remain very pleased with the company's broad position in the worldwide industrial market. and through both our acquisitions program as well as our organic innovation, we have developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within this market. We're proud of the company's long-term success in the industrial market and we look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts for many years to come. The automotive markets represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were weaker than we had expected coming into the quarter due to both the China shutdown in February, as well as COVID-19 related shutdowns by automotive customers in other parts of the world later in the quarter. Sales declined by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency and sequentially our automotive sales decreased by 13%. As we look towards the second quarter, we do expect sales to further reduce as customers shut down continue to impact demand, and as the number of our automotive plants are restricted from full operations in certain countries. At this time, it's very difficult to predict the exact timing and nature of the automotive market recovery. Nevertheless, and regardless of this extremely challenging period for the automotive market, we're very confident in our long-term position. When this crisis is behind us, we look forward to once again benefiting from our long-term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, which enable a wide array of on-board electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers across the world. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers were significantly impacted by the three weeks shutdown and subsequent month long ramp up of production in China. Sales in the mobile devices market declined by 20% from prior year and by a greater than expected 43% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Although the first quarter was very difficult for our team working in the mobile devices market, I'm just so proud that they were able to fully recover our production levels by early March. And as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect our sales to mobile device customers increase from these first quarter levels. Regardless of the COVID-19 related disruption in the first quarter, our long-term position in the mobile devices market remain very robust. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect and product and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always be one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunity from our customers that arises in 2020 and into the future. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased as expected from prior year by 14% in U.S. dollars and 31% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs. As we discussed extensively last year, the U.S. government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build out plans and inventory levels, leading to lower demand for our products. In addition, the China shutdown related to the COVID-19 crisis also impacted our sales in the first quarter in the mobile networks market. On a sequential basis, our sales actually increased 6% from the fourth quarter, and that was driven by higher sales to mobile network service providers. Given the continued disruptions related to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the ongoing U.S. government restrictions that I just discussed, we anticipate sales in the second quarter to be similar to those levels that we realized in the first quarter. Regardless of the continued challenges in the mobile networks market, we are confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunities with next generation equipment and networks. And as customers plan for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. I'd just mention in addition that as we all know global communication systems are being stretched by the radical shift in work and education practices due to the COVID-19 crisis. These factors create a significant long-term expansion potential for the company. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter were weaker than expected due to the impact of the China shutdown and the subsequent ramp back up to full production. Sales declined by 4% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically from prior year, as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions completed last year, together with stronger sales of server related products were offset by the impact of the production shutdowns in particular in China. Sequentially, our sales declined by 12% from the fourth quarter. I would mention that we did see a significant uptick in orders in the first quarter from a wide array of customers in the IT datacom market. We believe that surge in activity is related to our customers' efforts and our customers' customers' efforts to increase bandwidth in support of new demands related to the COVID-19 crisis and this includes the increase in online video communication, streaming services and gaming among others. We're well positioned to support these initiatives due to our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies including in particular high-speed and power products. And while we do expect sales to increase in the second quarter due to these strong orders, I would mention that we continue to face production challenges in many geographies due to COVID-19 related government restrictions. Nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next generation technologies.  The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales decreased by 10% from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a greater-than-expected 11% from the fourth quarter. We expect sales in the second quarter to increase as customers seek to quickly upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth that I discussed earlier. Our team is working very hard amidst the number of operational challenges to support these upgrades in capacity. Now turning to our outlook. Given the significant uncertainty related to the COVID-19 crisis, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our full year sales and EPS guidance at this time and we will not be providing a specific sales and EPS outlook for the coming quarter. With that said, we do expect sales and EPS in the second quarter to be lower than our first quarter level. This expectation is related to weaker demand in certain markets due to the overall economic environment as well as certain operational restrictions that we're experiencing in several countries related to the government measures that have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In some cases, these restrictions have limited our ability to adjust our resources in line with the volume declines we are experiencing, resulting in elevated costs in several of our businesses as we take actions to comply with government mandates, while also ensuring the safety and health of our employees. Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, you can rest assure that the team of Amphenolians around the world is fighting hard to secure the company's overall performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protect the safety and health of our more than 75,000 employees around the world.  So now to summarize, while the first quarter of 2020 has been uniquely challenging, I come away extremely proud of our team's performance. Amidst an unprecedented global pandemic, the Amphenol organization continue to execute extraordinarily well. In fact it is in times of crisis like we are all facing today that the Amphenolian culture demonstrates its true value. The company's strong performance is a direct reflection of our distinct and consistent competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, a worldwide presence, lean and flexible cost structure, our highly effective acquisition program and our agile entrepreneurial management team.  And I would just like to take this final opportunity to recognize and thank the entire Amphenol organization around the world for their focus on protecting our people and their communities, their dedication to supporting our customers and their agility in the face of uncertainty, all of which helps to create value for all of our stakeholders.  And at this time, operator, we will be very happy to take any questions if there are maybe. Operator : Thank you speakers. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. You may ask your question. Amit Daryanani : I will just stick to one question. Adam, do you think structurally anything is different today versus pre-COVID for Amphenol that would prevent the company from getting back to this 20% operating margin or the incremental margin you guys have talked about once things eventually normalize? And I guess when I just think about the cost optimization and things you've talked about, does that actually in your view lower the revenue run rate in the -- to get to that 20% operating margin target? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Amit, look, structurally, we are not different than we have been either in good times or bad. And you know it well, this is an organization in many respects that's purpose-built for crisis like we see today. The agility and the flexibility of our organization in times of change have always been nearly the hallmark of Amphenol's performance. And so for sure, the crisis is in many ways different from the prior crisis whether that was the tech collapse of 2001, the financial crisis of 2009. Because this is also a crisis where health of people is an issue. And so, Craig mentioned I think very acutely that our conversion margins going into -- in the first quarter were higher negative conversion margins, because you're dealing with the fact that government shutting down certain production or limiting production. You also have employees where we're taking steps to ensure the safety of our people and some of those steps have at least for the timebeing not the greatest effect on productivity or on efficiency, and all of those things that you have grown to expect about. But no doubt about it. the structural capability of this company, organizational, the cultural capability of this company to achieve the margins that we achieved just 90 days ago in the fourth quarter that hasn't changed whatsoever.  Now is something happens during this crisis that ultimately allows us to do even better, well let's let time tell. But I will say that we are always driving the strong conversion margins on the upside and moderating those conversion margins on the downside even in an environment like today where there are very, very different dynamics. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. You may ask your question. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, can you maybe comment on the pace and cadence of new design activity. You mentioned significant headwinds in mobile devices that you witnessed in the quarter, given that a lot of it is China centric. But given this disruption in travel and continued disruption, are you seeing or anticipating resulting push outs of product launches in mobile devices? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I think without commenting on any specific program, I would tell you that, that our customers in all of our markets and that includes mobile devices, I think there's an adjustment period to this new way of working. We are all working, and I'm sure all of you on the phone here today are working in a way that is very different than you had worked in the past, sitting in your offices, meeting in conference rooms and now we are all experts on video calls and working remotely and somehow trying to replicate the collaboration and the interaction that you can't really do in person, but that you can seek to replicate through all these different tools that we're all using. And as it relates to develop a new product, launching new product, no doubt about it that customers have to sort of adjust to this. But I will tell you, our teams who are working on new programs with customers -- and again not just in mobile devices, but overall, the level of interaction with customers now that everybody has kind of figured out the technology and figured out how to work in this way. I think that level of interaction continues really unabated. And in many ways I will tell you this personally, my ability to interact with customers, when I'm not flying $500 a year, it's amazing. I can visit so many customers from just the comfort of my desk here with the TV screen and a camera and that is -- and I know that technology existed before. But we all like to touch and feel and meet people in person and shake hands and I think we've had to adapt very rapidly to this new environment. And I believe this new environment actually creates wonderful opportunity and we'll learn a lot from it.  And again specific to individual launches, I think there were some sort of early adjustment periods that customers had. But by and large, what we see is to the extent that our customers have access to their manufacturing facilities that they can produce in full volumes that we still see an enormous amount of activity with customers around the world. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Craig Hettenbach : Adam, just a question on the book-to-bill which is very strong, I know there's particular end markets like comm and medical that are helping, but also kind of customers as they look to mitigate supply chain concerns. And so just curious to get a little bit more context on how you feel like kind of the shape of those bookings are and relative to kind of what the demand you're seeing is? Adam Norwitt : Well. Thanks you very much, Craig. I mean let's go back a little bit. When we think about these bookings, and they were very strong, I mean the strongest book-to-bill in our history, and one of the strongest order quarters we've had as Craig mentioned is up 7% year-over-year. Our original guidance for the quarter would have had a -- I think, at the high-end of $2 billion and we booked orders of $2.150 billion. So that would have been about 7%, 8%, which would have been a strong book-to-bill no doubt about it. So I think some element of the strong book-to-bill is just the production restrictions that we had in the quarter. And there's another element of that book-to-bill, which is really increased demand in certain areas, and pretty sudden increase in demand, whether it's in the wide range of medical products that our team is working on, whether that\u2019s in anything related to bandwidth and communication. And I talked about that in my prepared remarks as well that we see actually sequential increase in sales in a number of those areas. Now, the third category that you alluded to is our customers placing orders to secure position and prevent against supply chain risk or kind of otherwise get in line. There may be some of that, but I would put that kind of in the distant third position of those three factors that I have just reviewed. We haven't seen really things like double ordering or frantic kind of ordering just to kind of get a place in line. That's not what we're thinking. I think we have seen orders that we can't satisfy because of production requirements. Obviously, when you book $2 billion more than -- or $2.150 billion and you ship $1.860 billion, there are some orders that you book that you couldn't get out because of some of the restrictions. But I don't think that the customers really are having that kind of panic buy because of shortages. I think the orders are just a great reflection of the breadth of the importance that we play in the technologies of our customers and the importance in turn of our customers in the things that matter right now today. And I will just say one thing, I mean we have work in the IT datacom market and mobile devices market for so long, as you know very well Craig, and we have always done a phenomenal job of reacting to our customers, reacting to their needs. Those devices, they were supporting so many different applications, from video over the Internet, helping social media, all the various things that were driving demand for things like mobile devices, things like IT datacom. I will tell you, our team today works with a different purpose, because those systems that used to be for gaming and for video are now for educating kids. And without those systems, my kids would not be going to school today, we would not be able to function as a corporation, hospital would not be able to communicate with the families of the patients who they cannot visit physically, because of all of the restrictions. You hear wonderful stories about the use of tablet computers to allow families to tragically meet their loved ones sometimes for the last time and there's very, very critical stories. And I'd just say that our teams around the world feels a sense of purpose around this, and making sure that we can satisfy the requirements that our customers have, and we're fighting really hard to do that. And so, look the strong orders, I think, they\u2019re more a reflection of the urgency of the purpose. And our team is going to find a way no matter what to really support those customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. You may ask question. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Adam, relative to the operational restrictions you're facing outside of China, can you give us an idea of what your utilization or production levels are now, where you're seeing the biggest issues? And relative to that, are you expecting similar cost headwinds as you saw last quarter or is it too early to tell given the fluid situation? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Matt. I mean, look, the first quarter was largely about the sort of unprecedented, very clear shutdown in China. Chinese New Year came and it was on then February 10th when essentially you were allowed to reopen, and by the way, reopened with a lot of challenges because the government put forth a very, very detailed, very detailed requirements for you to reopen your factory, including things like, you had to have enough face masks for every employee to change their mask three times a day and you had to have 14 days of stock and they would come and audit, do you have enough face masks? And do you have enough disinfectant solution, temperature checking devices, all these things, a very rigorous process to reopen. I will say the rest of the world has not been necessarily as clear as what we saw in China, which is not surprising. I mean, every country does things their own way and that is what it is and it's not for us to judge that, but rather to react to it. And so, we operate as you know in 40 countries around the world, and every country has a little bit of a different approach, and even here in the United States where we operate in a number of locations, we have very significant workforce in the U.S. every state has a little bit of a different nuance to that. What are exempted businesses? What are essential businesses and how is that all defined? And so, our team around the world has been reacting to those restrictions, making sure that when we are essential that we're able to operate, making sure that our employees are kept safe, and fortunately we learned a lot in China, a lot and our Chinese team has been so helpful in to all of our other operations in making sure that we can stay open as much as the governments will allow us, as much as they possibly will allow us by putting in place the appropriate protective measures for our employees, and that's been a real critical aspect of staying open, where we have been able to do so, which is by the way, the vast majority of places, is making sure that, we can protect our employees and demonstrate to our people first that it's a safe workplace. And second, demonstrate that to the local governments who in most cases come and audit and inspect that. If your people don't believe they're coming to a safe workplace, they're not going to come. This is a but scary, scary virus and there's no doubt about it that you need to make sure that, the place of work is almost safer than the homes of our people. That's actually our mantra inside of Amphenol, make the workplace safer than the home and then the people will be comfortable and justifiably comfortable in coming in. Now, ultimately, what does that mean? What is our utilization? I'm sorry to tell you, I can't tell you that. We don't have a central computer system and I just don't know exactly what the utilization is. I can tell you that, we have a number of facilities, but not an enormous number for who are operating at lower than their capabilities. The number of facilities that are really not producing is relatively small in other countries, where these restrictions have been a little more rigorous. I would maybe point to a place like in India or Mexico, and even in those countries we are operating, we're not totally shutdown in those countries. We're operating as an essential business where it's appropriate for us to do so. In terms of the second quarter, I think Craig talked about the fact that, we had these extra costs. In the first quarter, we would expect to continue to have extra costs in the second quarter. And what the extent of those will be is really hard to predict, and that's part of the uncertainty that is underlying our reluctance to give a specific outlook here in the second quarter. And I don't know if Craig, you would like to add to that. Craig Lampo : Yes, I would just add one quick thing to that Adam, and I agree with actually everything you just said. I think as we're coming into the second quarter, though, I mean, the first quarter, we had the shutdown in China, which was that three week period and then obviously the ramp up from that. And then, really, what from impacted us in other countries, really the most meaningful part of that was probably in the second half of March. So, we're really in the second quarter, that's really an April in the second quarter, really seeing more of an impact from all the other countries and time will tell really how that resolves itself. So, it's a little bit of a difference between the first quarter second quarter, both actually having gone certainly a meaningful increase in cost just as a bit different, maybe a little bit different nature, full impact of the quarter with the rest of the countries which are all doing a little bit things a little bit differently. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may ask your question. Samik Chatterjee : I just wanted to follow up on the order trends and you compensated for that. And if you can kind of help share anything in terms of what you've seen for order trends early on in 2Q just because when I kind of compare the strong order trends you have with the lower economic activity. I mean, I would -- why should I not think that there should be some order cuts down the line from your customers? Because otherwise this given kind of the strength you have, you would definitely have a very strong robust here, right. So just help me think about that. Like, is -- are you starting to see somewhat from customers? Or am I wrong in thinking they should be some down the line? Craig Lampo : Yes, well, thank you very much. Look, I think our strong orders in the first quarter. I talked a lot about where those came from. I think it's a little premature to comment here on the second quarter order trends. We're just barely three weeks into the quarter and it's hard to see. I mean, I guess I would say that -- the orders, which in areas like IT datacom those were strong through the end of the quarter. It wasn't that it was kind of a thing early on like in February. I mean, the orders definitely strengthened through the quarter. Does that strengthen through the quarter continue here into the second quarter? Again, I think it remains a little early to say that. Does that mean that there is an order correction coming in? Again, we're dealing in a time period of enormous uncertainty. But one thing is for sure. I mean, when I look at the orders in the market where we probably have the strongest orders, which was IT datacom. These are not people putting stuff on shelves far from it. I mean, these are customers trying to get, frantically trying to get stuck in the field. So that you and I and our children and our parents can have bandwidth that is not a disaster, I mean, I'll tell you I am here in a house with three kids going to school, I mean I have only two kids, but one of them brought, a second mummy with them. And when everybody is in school at the same time and when I am on my perpetual video calls during the course of the day, it isn\u2019t the greatest experience for anybody because the bandwidth is so constrained in many, many places and I'm not talking from the most rural places here. And so, there is -- these upgrades, the capacity expansion, the bandwidth expansion is a real thing. This is not customers just saying I need to buy a bunch of stuff, put it on the shelf just in case these things are going to the field. I mean, you think about the medical market. They are producing every possible thing they can. They need every sensor that they can get. They need every connector that they can get in order to produce lifesaving equipment that needs to save a life like not in six months but like yesterday or today or tomorrow. So, I think this is real demand. I don't personally feel that we're looking at here, a kind of a supply chain build and people putting stuff in warehouses. That's a different dynamic than I believe what we're seeing today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. You may ask the question. Mark Delaney : So Just hoping to better understand that the medical business at Amphenol, maybe some sizing of that business in terms of the percentage of revenue. And then, you have any more details about how much exposure in terms of revenue it may have to some of these areas that are going to help support at COVID-19 patients like ventilators? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much Mark. Look, medical part of our industrial market and we haven't specifically split that out, but I would just tell you that it's an important part of our industrial market even though our industrial market doesn't have a dominant segment for sure. And across industrial everything from factory automation, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation and other important segments and including medical. Now, I think our medical business in the recent years, we've done a fantastic job of expanding our position in medical products and that started really with some acquisitions we made many years ago, but it was enhanced and accelerated 6.5 years ago when we entered the sensor market. With our original acquisition of GE\u2019s defense sensor business which was 6.5 years ago, who had a substantial sensor position across medical applications, and medical applications which by the way included a longstanding leadership position in respiratory therapy; and you can imagine that today respiratory therapy is kind of an important part of the medical market. We've always had a strong position in areas like patient monitoring and imaging and things like X-ray and CT and MRI and delivery of medications. And so that sensor business really positioned us, I believe even stronger than we were before because the sensor becomes such a critical component. And you'll recall, when we first got into the sensor market, one of the theories and secrecy that we had was that, while sensors representative a wonderful compliment and a part of the interconnect system, oftentimes the sensor element was a critical piece of the technological architecture of the products that we were in. And while it may not have always the highest value as an element, it has enormous value as a kind of tip of the spear into that application and into the engineering teams and the importance of the customer. And I would just say that we saw that and we\u2019ve seen that over these six years, we see it much more today. As we talk and I personally interface with so many medical customers around the world. There's no doubt about it, that having that sensor capabilities, that sensor portfolio that we've built not just with our visual acquisition, but multiple acquisitions thereafter. So it's a company that what it is now that our position in the medical market, not just in terms of size, but the importance that we serve to customers in the medical market has really enhanced. You'll also remember that last year, we made a wonderful acquisition in Germany of a great company called Bernd Richter, a real leader in medical market value-add interconnect, and together with our preexisting companies that are very active in investment products in the medical market. So again, I'm not answering specifically Mark your question, in terms of how, what is the exact size, but I will just tell you that it's a very important market and segments within the industrial market. And it's one where we're very, very proud that our technology can play a significant role in helping the world to do battle against this COVID-19 virus. Operator : Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Loop. Please ask the question. Shawn Harrison : Question on capital deployment in terms of thinking this downturn versus 2008, 2009, there wasn't really a lot of M&A activity back in that period other than times like the way that I believe. In the share repurchase activity, wasn't really something that Amphenol did either, and then we had this quarter where significant share repurchase. And wondering if you could maybe just comment on if your view of share repurchases going forward and then also, what do you think of the M&A environment in 2020? Does it dry up? Craig Lampo : Sure. Thanks Shawn. Yes, as we did mention, we did purchase this 2.7 million shares during the quarter for the average price of about $96. I would know that I guess that these repurchases did proceed this extreme market volatility that we saw during the quarter. And which kind of somewhat is evidenced by this the average price of the stock that we bought during the quarter. And the timing of our stock repurchasing certainly does always take a number of factors into account with regard to other cash needs in particular period and periods where we have, less acquisitions or other repurchases. There could be a less share repurchase is doing during that quarter or more share repurchase during the quarter when we have those lower cash needs. So that's certainly one of the reasons why we had a little bit higher in the quarter and per se, it gives you maybe a feel for the timing of that. Subsequently, we did draw down the revolver when that extreme kind of market environment took place, but those were really independent actions that really had nothing to do with each other and just so happened to occur in the same quarter while we drew down the $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility. And our intention would be with a revolving credit facility to really -- as we generate cash, as we continue to explore other opportunities with regards to funding, as the markets became a little bit more stable, we will do intent even as early as the second quarter here to start paying down some of those amounts, I mean the revolver. So, in terms of capital deployment, we do continue to take a flexible and balanced approach that has not changed. We haven't stopped anything kind of in a formal way, but certainly in this environment, where things are a bit of uncertain, we're going to be very thoughtful about our requirement and things like share purchases and other things and would be very prudent now from that perspective. And I guess, I'll let maybe Adam mentioned comment on the M&A. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, very well said, I would just relative to main environment Shawn. You've correctly point out that back in 2009. We did complete one acquisition early on, onto microwave, a fabulous company by the way. Here 11 years later, I can't tell you how happy we are to own it. We have never been a company that just chases market side or up and down, during times of crisis, bottom fishing if you will for prices and other things like that. We take a very thoughtful long-term approach to our M&A program and that means having long-term conversation with people ultimately dating them with the intention one day to get married. And I can tell you that, in a short-term market dislocation, most people, if they don't have to sell, probably are not going to wants to sell during the short-term markets to location. And probably, you don't want to necessarily buy during that short-term marketplace with location, when you really don't know the full extent of what you're buying. All that being said, what I will tell you this. During this environment, this is a very, very kind of existential environment for many companies, and a company like ours, who has the financial strength that Craig talked about, who has the diversity that we've talked about, who has the geographical diversity as well, the footprint diversity if you will, and who has that culture and reputation as an acquirer, becomes even more attractive destination for companies who may be going through today an existential crisis. Maybe they're only in one market, maybe they're only in one geography and they look kind of over the ledge today at their own existence. And I think that, that is a time where if those companies do survive, they may start thinking long-term about, do I want to do this alone now that I know that this kind of a crisis can happen. And I think the long-term prospects for us being a real acquirer of choice. I believe coming out of this can be quite substantial. Now what does it mean this year? How much of our capital we are going to allocate to west? How much M&A will we do? It's a lot of uncertainty to make any prediction on that front. But our long-term approach to capital deployment clearly is the priority toward new product development M&A and then obviously the dividend, the buyback that Craig has already talked about, and we look forward to continuing to be the acquirer of choice for the thousands of companies in this industry going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Please ask the question. Deepa Raghavan : Hey, good afternoon. I'm going to look ahead and ask about better times. Just looking back in history, can you talk about which verticals you typically see the covering earlier and which usually takes longer to recover? And hypothetically, let's assume macro forecasts are right, and we start to see some recovery sometime in the second half. Should we think about most of your sales actually being recoverable, some of something that got pushed out or can there also be examples of lost sales within your portfolio? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Deepa, and I love that you asked about better time. This is a great question and one that is really close to my heart. Look which verticals recover when? The answer to that is it depends. I mean, if you cannot, I believe compare the current environment with either 2009 or 2001. So, in 2001, we had many of our markets, which didn't even go down. You think about the military market as one example, even the industrial market was still relatively strong than it was really a tech bubble that burst and then was followed by the tech collapse. And then the recovery in 2001 was not so fast, if you'll remember well and 2002 was also not the easiest year. If you then go to the financial crisis, we had in the financial crisis, a very severe in the fourth quarter after Lehman Brothers reduction in demand. You'll recall that we quickly adjusted our headcount in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales I believe were down something like 15% and we adjusted our headcount down by 17% in the same quarter. And we ultimately secured the profitability of the Company in both of those prices is down by 300 basis points Now, I think this crisis is a little different because it's our first global pandemic in our lifetimes. It scares people. It affects people. People are afraid to go to work. They're afraid to go to the grocery store. They don't know. There's an intense personal insecurity to this crisis. But I will tell you too shall pass, I don't know if we're in the middle or you know, the old Winston Churchill saying, I don't know if this is this is not the beginning of the end, but it might be the end of the beginning. I don't know where we are in this crisis, but no doubt about it. It will one day have a beginning, a middle and an end. And what lies beyond that end, I believe an enormous amount of opportunities lie beyond that end. And I think what we are going to see at the end of this crisis, when that \u201cnormal\u201d that you refer to come. It will not be the same normal that we all knew on the 22nd of January. There will be differences. We will reevaluate how we work, how we live, how we learn how we function. And there's one common thread across all of that, from our perspective is people are seeing the importance of electronics in everything, whether that's electronics or medical equipment, whether that's electronics for communication purposes, you name it, safety, HVAC systems building automation. I mean, it doesn't take a big leap to start to think of just dozens and hundreds of new applications that will follow ultimately the reckoning that comes out of this very significant disruption that we've all experienced here. And I can tell you this, Amphenol sits strongly positioned for all of those opportunities wherever they may come. Our organization 123 General Managers around the world, each of them functioning in their little areas of the electronics world are poised to capitalize on whatever comes along. And we're going to be very proud to do that. Now, look what does that mean for the second half. I mean, you mentioned some macro forecasts. In the last 90 days I haven't heard a single forecast that's been correct. So, I don't know what those macro forecasts are really going to be whether there will be an L-shape or V-shape or U-shape and S-shape I don't know you tell me what shape or recovery is going to be better recovery will one day come that I'm sure. And when that comes is there a catch-up of demand, it's hard to say is there a catch up with demand. I mean, we're all sitting in our home. I'm certainly not using a lot of gas right now. So, I don't know that people are going to go use a bunch more gasoline when they get out and catch up to all the gasoline that we didn't use. I haven't filled the tank in my car for I think a month right now. And so, there are some things that need to have disappeared in terms of demand but there's so many opportunities for new things that are going to come out of this whole crisis. And ultimately, I think those things are going to be real positive in the long-term. Not a second half necessarily commentary, but I'm telling you, I think there's going to be a lot of good that's going to come out of it. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Fox from Fox Advisors. Please ask the question. Steven Fox : Adam thanks for all the helpful discussion. I guess the one thing I was left wondering about in terms of your own operations was your supply chain. You mentioned disruptions with running your factories, but can you just talk about your ability to source raw materials, subcomponents and how that has been handled and how you think it's going to be handled in this quarter? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Steve, look the supply chain is very important. I mean, we the suppliers are really important for us. One thing about Amphenol that very well, we don't have a centralized supply chain. We don't seek to put all of our stuff into one vendor and leverage that one vendor. We put the responsibility to manage our suppliers across all of our more than 120 general managers around the world. We may share information and do some smart things about that. But we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket of a supplier and I can tell you. Today, I'm very grateful for that. Because there are suppliers even in the month of February through the China shutdown our organization was so much quicker than most others to come back to full production. There were suppliers who were not able to come back who didn't have the wherewithal, the agility, the capabilities to do what our team was so successful at doing and coming back to production. And to the extent that any of those, which for us usually are very small suppliers, create any disruption, we went and help them right away. Our team was there for them supporting those suppliers. We haven't seen anything material in terms of are meaningful, I should say it's a double entendre material anything meaningful in terms of the impact from our supply chain. I guess the one thing I would maybe point to is not really suppliers as much as logistics. It's been well reported. There are some logistical impediments going on in the world right now. Freight capacities are quite significantly limited in certain areas and our team's done a great job of working collaboratively across the organization to make sure that we're getting the product that we need when we need it and getting what our customers need when they need it. So, there's a little bit more work involved in doing that, but now there was 90 days ago. Operator : Next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Please ask your question. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. It relates to the margin trajectory we might expect to over the current and next couple quarters. We understand that the decrementals were a little bit, less let say they were a little bit worse than what they typically are in a downturn for Amphenol because you have some more challenging times in readjusting costs, when you can't take actions on the employee base given the -- all the things going on with COVID. And I wonder whether we should expect this to have a relatively quicker resolution where we could see a quarter here a better than expected decrementals because you can align the cost base with the level of demand or if we should expect another quarter or two with the sort of current more challenging alignment of those two things? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. Let me just start off by saying, I think, as a company, we're really just proud of the fact that we were still able to achieve the 70% operating margins in the first quarter with all the obstacles that we had to deal with in the first quarter with China being closed, with the other parts of the world. Having productivity issues and having some of our facilities closed or limited terms of people, so the fact that in that case, so to 70%, and essentially had a sequential quarter kind of conversion from Q4 to Q1 and just 40%, not so far over our typical 30% downside conversion, I think it's just a testament to the team. So I just kind of wanted to start with kind of that because I think that's really just the important point and that we're really proud of. Now, as it relates to kind of going forward into the second quarter and we certainly didn't or make or giving guidance for the second quarter. Adam, we did say that we do expect sales and it has to be lower in the second quarter. So, with that being said, I said that I wouldn't expect profitability or the pressures on our profitability to be meaningfully better in the second quarter than they were in the first quarter. I mentioned before that in the first quarter, we have this China specific event that happened and it really wasn't until the end of the first quarter that we really saw the other parts of the world starting to create issues with regards to adding cost, or limiting our ability to adjust costs. And that's really what we're seeing in a bigger way in the second quarter. And so I think that we would expect still to have a drive from the banning, throughout the second quarter at this point in time. I wouldn't expect dramatically different sequential quarter conversions going into the second quarter that from the first quarter, second quarter, I can maybe normal-ish conversions. But again there's so many unknowns right now, as we kind of come into the second quarter that it's really difficult to compete on that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. You may ask your question. Jim Suva : Thank you so much and great to hear the Amphenol team is doing well and your positive outlook, which a lot of my questions have been answered for that. So, I'll just ask one a little bit. When we think about guide posts and I've been on the sell-side for over 20 years, I think back in history in the global financial crisis, the worst quarter year-over-year was down 19%, but then back in the tech bubble burst, there was some times of down 30% year-over-year. And I think about this crisis, the coronavirus is much different of global plant closures. But then you talked about how positive your team came back in China. So, can you give us any guide posts at all about, is it much different from some of those past historical trends we've seen or the plant closures and coming back make it much different? Any guidance or color would be greatly appreciated. Adam Norwitt : Well. Thanks so much Jim. I mentioned earlier that, I think well one can on their face say well there was the global financial crisis, there was the tech collapse and should we or should we not compare this moment to those. I think there is the different here. We have never worked in an environment where governments are so deeply impactful and for good reason, by the way. I mean I think governments need to take a role. They have an extraordinary role to play in protecting the health of all of us on the phone and all of the citizens of the world. And so justifiably, I think governments have taken steps to limit interaction of people and thereby slow the spread of the virus and the way it's happened has been very different. China I talked about was a very clear, very distinct and by the end of a certain time period, which was not so long. I mean it was at the time it felt like ages let me tell you, three weeks felt like for years to all of because we were planning the kind of reentry. But there was a moment in time, where you knew you could take your people back to work as long as you did certain things to protect them. And I think in the rest of the world, the actions haven't been as clear as the actions were in China and thus the coming out of that is also I believe less clear. And so, what is that going to look like? It will depend. It will depend on the country. It will depend on the results. It will depend on the sort of means so many times this term, are we bending or not the curve and all of these various things and it's not dependent on is the fiber capacity in the market now finally filled and we can start re-building fiber optic equipment back in year 2000. It's not dependent demand coming back because people are not getting foreclosed upon in their mortgages and unemployment and all of those things. There an element obviously, I mean unemployment is increasing in many countries, for example, very significantly. So, there is an end demand that is related in some way to this crisis, but not a direct part of the battle against COVID-19. When does that end demand come back depend on so many factors. What's the degree of government stimulus that's going to be available to people? What will companies have in terms of support loans or grants or otherwise? I know, there are a lot of factors that come into this, which makes me feel like to draw that perfect parallel from those two crises. It would be maybe a dangerous parallel to draw. Again, I just reiterate one more time. From our perspective, it just doesn't matter, because our team is ready regardless. We are purpose built for a time of strong demand. We're also purpose built for a time where demand is very uncertain, and that's the agility, the flexibility of all of our organization that and really the resiliency of the organization in a time of kind of unprecedented uncertainty. And our ability to adapt, and to embrace a new environment is I believe second to none, and we'll get through this regardless. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please ask your question. Joseph Spak : Thank you so much, Adam. I do want to just quickly I guess I'll follow on your last comments and go back to some of the color you gave on the China restart in the lessons learned. I think that's important. As you mentioned, that was pretty intense. It's unclear if it's followed elsewhere in the world. But you also mentioned your place to feel safe and I think there's some plants with a decent amount of manual labor and lines can be set up with employees and close to each other. So you might have to do more than as minimally required in certain areas to get that level of comfort among your employees. So we think about, even beyond second quarter when there's obviously still going to be some costs because of the shutdown, there's productivity not get back to where it was until there is a vaccine, is that your view? Or does it sort of not matter, because to follow on your here, your last comments, you may just snapback to pre COVID immediately, either? Adam Norwitt : Yes, it's a great question. So I mean, I think what you're saying is, there is a pre-vaccine and the post-vaccine world and I would tend to agree with you. There is a pre-vaccine role and there's a post-vaccine world. And the pre-vaccine world is going to require you to probably take more aggressive steps to protect your people. And I would just point out one thing it was for us absolutely clear, as right on January 23 when that shutdown happened, the pure priority, the overarching priority of our corporation has to be to protect our people. And we do that because it's the right thing to do as a fellow human, of those 75,000 people around the world, but we do it also because it's just good business. If you don't protect your people, you see what happened. And there have been so many examples around the world, some well recorded and others not so well reported of the kind of catastrophic effect on a corporation business if they're not sufficiently protecting their people. So we went overboard. We absolutely went overboard from the very get go making sure that our people were well protected. And yes, we have factories where we have assembly workers who used to work very close together. They're not working close together today. And we figured it out. We\u2019ve repurposed offices. We\u2019ve repurposed warehouses. We've staggered shifts. We've done so many things. Now, do all of those things ultimately hurt productivity in the pre-vaccine medium term, unnecessarily, I don't think they do not necessarily. I mean, you'd be amazed at the resilience and adaptability, not just of our management team, but of our people on the factory floor. And I thought, and I'll just put a plug in here right now. We have every time for our earnings release and management call. These people in our factories are the heroes of Amphenol today. They are everyday walking in the door of a factory. Well, those not the other people who can work from home are doing so, give a lot of people who have to go to work every day to do their jobs. And their jobs are so important today. Like I said, I mean, they're building things that go into life-saving equipment for building things to go into mission critical communications network. And these heroes of our company who are going every day, it\u2019s our job to protect them regardless of if that means I have to space them out in the factory, regardless of whether that means, I have to have the shift not overlap quite as much and lose 2% in productivity that day because of that, that's not a consideration at this point. I believe that our teams are going to make it happen regardless, and we're going to always follow that priority right now. It says we got to protect our people and protect them we will. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Kelley from Jefferies. You may ask the question. David Kelley : I had a quick question on automotive. I believe you mentioned sales decline 8% year-over-year in the quarter. That's significantly outperformed the market. I was just hoping for some color on your exposure and what you're seeing there. Are you seeing any step-up in content? Was there anything region specific that drove that upside? And then just curious, if you're expecting the impact from supply chain timing, that might be a headwind coming into the second quarter here? Adam Norwitt : Look, I think we have been outperforming the automotive market for the better part of a decade. And I think, I hate to say outperforming when we're down 2%, I don't like to say that, but I guess maybe it's technically true. I mean, we're down 8%. It's not the greatest thing in the world. But yes, is it outperforming and maybe it is, and I think our outperformance has been because we've just done a great job capitalizing on new electronic applications in the car. I think that this crisis when all is said and done, the automotive market is going to return and I think that that constant quest for new features in cars is going to continue and I would bet that there is going to be some new features that may not be unrelated to keeping people safe in cars and keeping cars clean, keeping the air clean in cars and so many other things like that. So, I personally think that the long-term in the automotive market is remains to be a great opportunity in the long-term constant growth opportunity for Amphenol remains strong. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Nikolay Todorov from Longbow. Please ask your question. Nikolay Todorov : I understand it's more of an art than science, but I would love to hear your assessment of what downstream inventories look like. I understand that things in life and communications and IT systems and medical sales orders are going into the field, but what about some of our markets? What is your view on how much current orders are driven by underlying consumption versus inventory positioning? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, I think I mentioned earlier, we don't see a lot of customers just putting a bunch of stuff in their warehouses. We don't have perfect visibility, the only place where we have visibility its inventories and our distribution channel. We haven't seen anything abnormal in the inventory amongst our distributors at this point. In fact, I'd say our distributors are continuing to service their customers, very vigorously especially those customers who have incremental demand related to the COVID-19 battles that are that are going on. I wouldn\u2019t say that we see a big mismatch in inventory to the extent that we have this ability. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Joe Giordano : I just wanted to follow up on some of the questions we talked about on productivity. So, I already mentioned like a pre-vaccine, post-vaccine. How do you guys just think about structurally, is this something a fundamental change where the -- what you saw was 100% capacity is now like a 120% capacity, like we have to rethink how these facilities long-term are weighed out? So we need to use more automation. Is there an upward bias on, on labor costs to kind of incentivize people to come back? And just how do you think of that longer term than just overseeing right today? Adam Norwitt : Thanks. Look, we don't think about this monolithically. I think that every operation is different in Amphenol. That's one of the beauties of the Company is we have also an enormous amount of operational diversity across the Company. We have some operations are highly automated. We have others they are highly manual. And they usually tend to be very much tailored to the market that they serve the geographies that they service from, is this going to create a new factor for people to consider, of course it is. I think it's going to create a new factor for everybody to consider for the rest of our lives. And that just means that each of our general managers and managing their operation is going to integrate that into their calculus of what are they going to do to optimize a business. But look, we have an expression in Amphenol and no excuses approach to management. It's a team of people who just make this happen. We've been through a lot of different stuff over the course of our careers and my career is now 22 years with the Company wonderfully. And through that time, we have seen so many changes, changes in the cost of labor in certain geographies, changes in where things can be made careerist, I mean, you name it. It's been an enormous amount of changes that come along and the fact now that we need to prioritize and secure our locations for the health of the people. Do I believe that this is going to have a kind of a permanent negative drag on productivity? I do not. Look, in the short term, we have a lot of governmental shutdown for dealing with, of course, that's going to have short term impacts. You're paying people not to work in a number of places. But -- and you're doing that by law and also because it's the right thing to do. And but is this going to have a structural change to Amphenol\u2019s ability to be a highly productive manufacturing organization and thereby to drive strong returns for the Company, I don't think it will. Operator : Thank you, speakers. At this time, we don't have any questions on queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back to you for any closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much, and thank you all for your extended time today. We wanted to give everybody a chance to have the question. Look, I wanted to say to just a few words here. I mentioned earlier, we're in a crisis unlike any of us, have lived through, but there will be a beginning and middle and an end to this crisis. There's no doubt about it. I'm not going to be the one to predict when does the end come, or when does the beginning of the end come, but it will come. There's no doubt about it. And what I have encouraged our employees to do and I will encourage all of you as well is, relish the positives that may come out of it, take advantage of the things that we're learning about ourselves, about how we can work, how we can operate, and about our fellow people that I think are really some of the wonderful silver linings of what is a true tragedy for many people. And that tragedy I'm sure all of you have been touched in some way or another by that tragedy. And we wish that all of you continue to stay safe with your families, your colleagues, and all stay safe. And I'm sure one day we will get the chance to meet all of you in person, and I look forward certainly to sitting in the office with my colleagues at the nearest possible occasion. And regardless of that comes, you can rest assured that the Amphenol management team is there to support all of our stakeholders and to make sure that this company and our people remain safe and strong and that our company remains also healthy and strong for the long-term. Thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking to you again 90 days from now. Craig Lampo : Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $1.987 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 and $0.81, respectively. Sales were down 1% in U.S. dollars and were flat in local currencies, compared to the second quarter of 2019. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts, sales in the second quarter decreased 3%. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and was flat in local currencies compared to last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $357 million in the second quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 18%, which was down 230 basis points, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year reduction in operating margin reflected a higher negative conversion rate than our typical 30% downside conversion, due to the continued negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on production and productivity, particularly due to various government restrictions that have limited our ability to adjust costs in certain geographies. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, operating margin increased 100 basis points and reflected a strong sequential conversion margin on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 20% in the second quarter of 2020, which was down compared to 22.2% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 9.4%, which is down compared to 9.7% in the second quarter of 2019, but up from 7.6% for the first quarter of 2020. Given the continued unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ongoing ability to minimize the negative margin impact resulting from the crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture and thereby allows us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million, which was unchanged compared to the second quarter of last year. The company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the second quarter of 2020 and 2019. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020 excludes an excess tax benefit of $12 million, associated with the stock option exercises during the quarter. And the adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 excludes the impact of an excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises during the quarter, partially offset by the tax impact of acquisition-related costs. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2020, including the items just mentioned, was 20.7% compared to 21.3% in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted net income was 12% of sales in the second quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS declined by 9% in the second quarter to $0.85 compared to $0.93 in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS declined 12% to $0.81 in the second quarter of 2020 from $0.92 in the second quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $1.971 billion, which was down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of just under 1 :1. Despite the unprecedented challenges in the current environment, the company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $368 million in the second quarter or 150% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending of $67 million, our free cash flow was $301 million or 123% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $928 million, respectively at the end of June. In inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 74 and 60 days, respectively. While DSO and DPO were both went on a normal range, DSI was slightly elevated. Due to the current crisis we expect inventory days to remain somewhat elevated, but to come back down to more normal levels as business returns to a more typical pattern. During the second quarter, our cash flow from operations of $368 million, along with proceeds from our recently completed bond offering of $543 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $123 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand of $1.1 billion net of translation were used primarily to fund repayments under our various credit facilities of $1.35 billion. Fund repayments of senior notes of $400 million, fund net repayments under our commercial paper programs of $135 million, fund payment of contingent acquisition-related obligations of $75 million, fund dividend payments of $74 million, fund net capital expenditures of $67 million and fund new debt financing cost of $5 million.  As communicated in our April earnings release, due to the significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the credit and capital markets created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, the company had proactively borrowed $1.25 billion under our revolving credit facility and reduced our reliance on commercial paper markets. As the credit and capital markets stabilized during the second quarter, we repaid the amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility with cash on hand, as well as the proceeds from the $500 million and \u20ac500 million bond offering completed in May. As such, as of June 30, 2020, there are no balances outstanding under either our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper programs. As a result, at June 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.3 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. and total debt at June 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021. Net debt at June 30 was $2.5 billion, which decreased from $2.7 billion as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Total cash on hand, as well as the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which leaves the company in a very strong liquidity position. The second quarter of 2020 EBITDA was $444 million, and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.3 times. In summary, although this continues to be a challenging environment, we finished the quarter in a position of continued financial strength with a very strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We believe this financial strength, coupled with the company's broad market and geographic diversity, positions us well for the currently volatile environment, which is characterized by continued uncertainty across global markets. I will now turn it back over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And first, I just want to also offer my hope and wishes that for all of you on the call here, that you, your family, your friends, as well as your colleagues have remained safe and healthy over the course of the last quarter. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I'm also going to discuss the trends and progress across our sales markets. And then finally, I'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. With respect to the second quarter, as Craig just detailed, our sales reached $1.987 billion, which was a reduction from prior year prior year of just 1% in U.S. dollars, it was actually flat in local currencies and down just 3% organically. And this was driven by reductions in the automotive, commercial air, mobile networks and military markets, which were essentially offset by growth that we saw in the IT datacom, mobile devices and industrial markets. The declines that we saw in the quarter were largely related to the weakness in demand, disruptions and government mandated factory shutdowns that resulted all from the COVID-19 pandemic. We're, in particular, very pleased to have realized 7% sequential growth from the first quarter, which is substantially higher than our original expectations. The company booked $1.971 billion in orders, representing a book-to-bill of just under one to one. And very importantly, despite the significant disruptions to our operations in the quarter related to the pandemic, operating margins reached 18%, a very strong performance given this environment. As Craig just mentioned, Amphenol's financial position remains extremely strong, and that is reflected very well in our operating cash flow of $368 million in the quarter. I just want to say that I'm extremely proud of our team around the world. And our performance this quarter, once again, is a great reflection of the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization who has continued to perform well amidst the unprecedented challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We're very pleased in the quarter to announce that we, just last week, closed the acquisition of Onanon, Inc. Onanon is based in California and has annual sales of approximately $20 million, and the company designs and manufactures a wide array of high-technology connectors and cable assemblies for customers in the industrial market and with a particular focus on medical related applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, it is our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol that remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now, turning to our progress across our served markets, I just want to comment first that the value of the company's balanced and broad end market diversification has become even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. While several of our end markets were negatively impacted by the pandemic in the second quarter, that impact was essentially offset by growth that we achieved in other markets. Our diversification continues to mitigate the impact of volatility that can be seen in individual end markets and geographies, while at the same time exposing us to new opportunities as well as important new technology developments wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. In a dynamic and unpredictable environment like we're experiencing today, this diversification is a truly great asset for the company. Now, first, the military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to quarter. Sales were down by 12% compared to prior year as certain of our facilities faced production restrictions from government measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased as we had expected by about 20%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase back to our first quarter levels as we look to recover to full production at most of our facilities that work in support of military customers. Our team focused on the military market has worked hard for many years to strengthen Amphenol's broad technology position while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Given the ongoing and continuing favorable military spending environment, the Amphenol team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we can execute on this increased demand, even amidst the disruptions that we experienced here in the second quarter. This enables us to continue to support the many next-generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Second quarter sales declined by 41% from prior year, as the commercial aircraft market saw unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the disruptions to the global travel industry related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sequentially, our sales decreased also by 41% from the first quarter. As we look ahead, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel that we are seeing across the world. Accordingly, we expect a further approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales in this market in the third quarter. Regardless of the difficult environment in the commercial air market, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems that are integrated into those aircraft and we remain well-positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. In fact, it is in challenging times like this that our steadfast and reactive support for customers can create the most long-term value and thereby position us for long-term success. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and our performance in the second quarter was stronger than we had expected, with sales increasing by 12% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. This growth was driven in particular by strength in the medical, instrumentation and heavy equipment segments, together with some contributions from our acquisitions that we completed last year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a very strong 17% from the first quarter. I'd like to emphasize how proud I am of our team, in particular, working in support of medical applications within the industrial market. That team continues to work tirelessly to ramp up our production of sensors, connectors and interconnect assemblies to meet demand from a broad array of customers producing equipment that's used in support of medical treatment for COVID-19 patients. We're just very proud of them. This month's acquisition of Onanon further strengthens our broad high-technology offering for the medical equipment market. As we look into the third quarter, we expect a modest decline from these higher levels of sales. Nevertheless, we remain very pleased with the company's strong position in the worldwide industrial market. Through both our acquisition program as well as our organic innovations, we've developed a broad range of products across a diversified array of exciting industrial segments. We're proud of this success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come. The automotive market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by a very significant 42% in U.S. dollars and 41% in local currency, as stay-at-home orders around the world reduced customer demand for new cars, and at the same time, as government restrictions across many countries resulted in factory shutdowns by automakers and their suppliers. Sequentially, our automotive sales decreased by 35%. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect sales to the automotive market to substantially improve compared to the second quarter, as the industry begins to recover and as factories ramp up their production levels. However, we do not yet expect sales to reach last year's levels, as the global automotive industry continues to experience somewhat lower demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this very challenging time period for the automotive market, we remain confident in Amphenol's long-term position. We've expanded our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products both organically and through acquisitions to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to mobile device customers increased by 20% from prior year, as demand recovered after the three-week shutdown and subsequent month-long ramp-up of production that we saw in China during the first quarter. Sequentially, our sales in mobile devices increased by a very strong 47%, which was substantially better than our expectations had been coming into the quarter and which did reflect some catch-up of production after the first quarter shutdowns in China. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect a modest increase from these elevated second quarter levels. While 2020 has thus far seen substantial impacts on the mobile devices market from the pandemic, our long-term position in this market remains very robust. Amphenol's leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices. And while there's no doubt that this market will always remain one of our most volatile, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2020 and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market decreased by 20% from prior year and 23% organically, as we were impacted by reduced demand from wireless OEMs and particularly related to the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we discussed extensively in previous quarters. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a stronger-than-expected 9% from the first quarter, driven essentially by higher sales to equipment manufacturers. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the mobile networks market to moderate from these levels on lower demand from both OEMs and service providers. Regardless of any near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up their investments for these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position, with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the second quarter for this market were much better than expected, rising from prior year by a very strong 37% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as increased data traffic drove both our OEM and service provider customers to significantly increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacomm market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a very strong 43% from the first quarter. I just can't tell you enough how proud I am of our team working in the IT datacom market, who, despite facing production restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in certain geographies, we\u2019re still able to react quickly to satisfy the significant increase in demand from our customers. As we look towards the third quarter, we now expect a roughly mid-teens sequential decline from the second quarter's very high levels. Our team's continued efforts at developing industry-leading products across a wide array of technologies, including, in particular, high-speed and power products, has positioned us to benefit from the continued demand for increased bandwidth that is likely to persist as individuals, companies, students and governments adjust interacting remotely. We remain encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market and especially, given this increased demand for bandwidth, our customers around the world are driving their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage these dramatic increases in demand. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom, through their ongoing development of a wide range of next-generation products. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12% from the first quarter. We expect sales in the third quarter to remain roughly at these levels as our operator customers continue to upgrade capacity in their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth, driven by online video and other remote school and work tools. We remain encouraged by the company's continually expanding range of products for the broadband market, together with our strong positions with customers around the world. And we continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier, thereby ensuring that the company can benefit as operators increase their network investments. Now turning for a moment to our outlook, the continued and significant economic and public health uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic make it difficult to accurately forecast our performance in the second half of 2020. Accordingly, we will once again not be providing full year guidance. However, considering the current demand environment and assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic as well as constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $1.960 billion to $2 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.84 to $0.86. This guidance represents a sales decline versus prior year of 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 9% to 12%. Now let me just say, I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance here in the second quarter, particularly in light of the many challenges our team has faced related to the COVID-19 pandemic. I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team. To meet these challenges and to navigate these challenges, while capitalizing on the many current and future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The Amphenol team around the world remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves to protecting the safety and health of all of our employees during this pandemic. And I would just like to finish by taking this opportunity to thank each and every one of the Amphenolians around the world for their dedication and their outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Absolutely [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up. First one here, if I think about the implied operating margins you guys are guiding for September quarter it's around 19%, slightly less than that I think, on about 2 billion of sales. I would love to understand because if I go back to the first half of \u201819 when revenues are in this $1.95 billion to $2 billion range, you guys are doing well over 20% operating margins. What's this 100 basis points delta attributed to? Is this just a cost to COVID as we go forward and more structural, or do you think it's transient as you go forward? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks, Amit. Yes. First, I think we're really happy with the operating margins. We certainly had in 2006 second quarter reaching 18% with the significant cost that we had due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government mandates and the restrictions that impacted certainly our production and productivity. As we look into the third quarter, we still expect to have some of those costs impacting us. I mean, certainly, to a lesser extent, we had some improvements. We saw some improvements as we came through the second quarter. But we still have some of those headwinds as we're moving into the third quarter, just to a lesser degree. But -- and you can see that by the sequentially from second quarter to the third quarter improvement that we're, kind of, implying. I think your math is not so far off in terms of our implied margins as we look into the third quarter. If you look to your question, in terms of the impact from the first quarter of 2019 or even if you look at the fourth quarter of 2019, there's a couple of things that are impacting our margins in the third quarter. One would be certainly the COVID costs that we're still going to be incurring in the third quarter, albeit to a lesser degree. And then the other thing, if you're comparing to earlier in 2019, we still do have a little bit of headwind on margin related to certainly some of the acquisitions we did, we did nine acquisitions in 2019, all of which were -- or many of which were below our average margin. And that we're still continuing the journey to bringing up to the company average. As you can imagine, as we're going through a pandemic and all the things that they have to deal with to ensure that their businesses are maximizing their profitability, and given the -- in many cases, the revenue reductions, some of these actions aren't necessarily easy to implement in the current time. But we certainly have full expectations in the longer term that we still should be able to get them back up to the company average. So that really would be the bridge if you, kind of, were comparing earlier 2019 quarters to essentially the third quarter of 2020. But I have to say still, I'm extremely proud of the team, achieving 80% in the second quarter and then taking the actions that are needed to really sequentially get up to these higher levels that we do expect in the third quarter. We're really happy with those results. Operator : Thank you speakers. And just a reminder for the parties that queued up for the Q&A to limit asking to only one question. Thank you. We'll proceed to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congratulations on the good results. I was hoping to better understand what the company has seen in the mobile devices end markets, and to what extent are there opportunities for the company to participate in more sophisticated designs, especially around 5G in the second half of this year in some of the past years when the company's had good participation on new program launches. You've seen a pretty big sequential increase in the third quarter. I realize there's a base effect of where you're coming in off of the 2Q levels. But trying to understand to what extent you're able to participate in some of those opportunities in 3Q? Is there anything around just timing and maybe it's more 4Q this year, or what's the opportunity set that's maybe playing into the guidance there? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Mark. Look, I talked already in my prepared remarks about the fact that in the second quarter, there was some degree of catch-up from the first quarter. And I just want to credit our team for what a fabulous job they did in recovering from the shutdown. As you know, well, our mobile devices business, virtually all of that is manufactured in China. And so when that was really having that comprehensive shutdown in the first quarter, that had a disproportionate impact on our mobile devices team and also on the manufacturing of our customers, in fact, at the same time. So, our team did a fabulous job of recovering, getting all the workforce back in place by really the beginning of March and then was able to really catch up with that demand here in the second quarter. And normally, we would not see a 47% increase in the second quarter. In fact, the second quarter -- sequentially. The second quarter tends to be a little bit more of a lull in the mobile device market, as you know, having followed the company for quite some time. So, I think if you take that out, that sort of anomaly here in the first half, we still have in the second half, great participation in many new programs. And whether those are 5G-related or otherwise, just the devices continue to get more complex; our team devices continue to do a great job in helping to enable those devices from a wide array of customers and ultimately puts us in a very strong position. I would say with the pandemic that there does appear to be a little bit of slippage in some programs that maybe would have normally launched a little bit earlier that may be combined with that disproportionate second quarter that we saw. I think if you factor all that out, you probably get to a little bit -- a little bit more normal-looking sequential outlook for mobile devices. But we continue to have a very strong position. We're excited about these next-generation programs that are coming, the new functionalities that are being put into the phones. And while we're never going to win everything, every new program is kind of a new jump ball for us. Our team has just done a fabulous job of supporting customers in good times and bad. And we're normally -- we have come to bat for our customers when they have a new launch and when others maybe can't support as well. The ramp-ups -- here we came to bat for our customers during a pandemic when everything was very chaotic in the first half and our team just kept their head down, kept focused, made sure that we had the right resources in place, the right capabilities to meet what our customers needed. And I think that puts us in a strong position to the extent that there are opportunities for incremental volumes or incremental programs in the near and the long-term, I think we'll be well-positioned to take advantage of those. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thank you. Adam, I guess good to see kind of a thaw in the M&A environment after the first half of the year. So, just curious to get your take on that small tuck-in and just how you see things set up in terms of opportunity set and ability to execute on M&A as those opportunities arise? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Craig. I mean, we're really excited. It's not a big company on and on, but it's a great company. And I think it is a wonderful reflection of our approach to acquisitions. We have taken for a long, long time that very patient approach of incubating relationships with a wide array of companies around the industry and around the world, developing relationships, developing real mutual trust between us and the owners of these entrepreneurial companies, such that when it is appropriate and when they have -- they have sort of crossed the kind of canyon, if you will, of deciding that they want to sell their company, we don't have to build that trust from scratch. We've already established those wonderful relationships. Because the fact is in a pandemic, when we're all socially distancing, creating new relationships from scratch is harder, its much harder to do. And so this was not in the case of Onanon. A book that showed up from a banker, and we said, well, who are these people? Well, you can't meet them. None of that happened. We had long-standing interactions with the entrepreneurs who founded this company and who, by the way, stay on as now the general manager of that company going forward. And so we're very excited about that. The second thing is this is a company that has just a really unique technology proposition, unique products that go into exciting areas of the industrial market, in particular, into medical technology. And we \u2013 I talked earlier about the strength of our medical business in the quarter, it's not that we saw that strength and thereby said, oh, let's go buy Onanon because it's a medical company, that\u2019s more coincidental. But I think the fact is is they are a company that is present in next-generation electronics, used in a wide array of applications that are exciting and that are important. And we are very proud to bring them into the Amphenol family. The overall M&A environment in a pandemic, it's different. As you can imagine, you're going to be more careful. You're going to make sure you know the people. You're going to make sure that the business has resilience to it in a time like this. But all that being said, we continue to have a strong pipeline and, you know, Craig, Craig mentioned before, we acquired nine companies last year, I don't know that we're going to do that this year with the pandemic so far in the first half but we're very pleased that we were able to make this one and bring them into the Amphenol family, and we're very hopeful that there will be more to come in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Question, Adam, regarding the industrial sector. You had very strong results there. You talked about some of the end markets, particularly medical. Did you see any signs of maybe some pull-in inventory building at customers. We're hearing that from some semiconductor company and other component companies. So I'm wondering, if you're seeing any of that. And then within the medical markets, are you beginning yet to see a shift from COVID-related demand and products versus elective surgeries? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Matt. Great question. Look, I don't know that I would all the demand a pull-in. But I would call the demand that we saw for COVID related medical equipment, in particular, things like ventilator, respiratory therapy devices, patient monitoring for new hospital construction, things like that, that was very, very significant demand. There's no doubt about it. Is that a pull in? I mean, it didn't exist before, this demand. So it was all new demand, the world never built as many ventilators as the world is now building. And I don't know that pull in would be necessarily the right term for that, but there was definitely a rush to build. And from our perspective, what our team just did such a great job of is massively increasing their capacity to support that demand when oftentimes, our competitors could not do so. And I can't tell you the number of calls I've had with customers, letters of gratitude from customers, dozens, if not hundreds of programs in support of COVID, where our team just pulled out all the stops and made it happen. And we worked with companies who never built medical equipment before. We've worked with long-term medical companies. We've worked directly with governments around the world, who are building strategically their medical infrastructure. And these are all things that were not just, sort of, a one-time situation, but rather is an ongoing recognition that the world just didn't have enough of a certain type of medical equipment to deal with the respiratory borne pathogen. And I'm guessing that, that is not a situation that people around the world want to face again. Now, are we seeing a shift from more COVID-focused medical equipment to the more elective surgical? I mean, there's no question that early in the quarter, we did see a little bit softer demand for products that are used in purely elective fashion. I wouldn't say that, that was material. And obviously, despite that, our medical business within industrial did really, really well. I mean this is outstanding performance. Is that balancing a little bit more here coming into the third quarter? Yeah, I guess that would probably be a fair way to put it. I mean, we expect, as I said earlier, in the third quarter, we expect our sales to be at or a little bit below the levels that they were in the second quarter. These are very, very high levels of consumption. And our team continues to work hard to make sure that we can satisfy that demand. And if there's a little bit of a more broad demand for some of those things that were earlier push back, that may be the case. But look, we're just really proud of what the team has done here in medical. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see, given the order number that you had, which looks like for the first time in a while is below the $2 billion number. If you can give us a bit more kind of visibility into what the cadence was through the quarter, particularly kind of exiting the quarter? What was the cadence like? And curious if you're seeing any big differences in terms of order activity between regions given that the different regions seem to be in different places relative to containment of COVID? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I think that we came into the quarter, as you will recall, on the heels of very, very significant orders that we had in Q1. We had the highest book-to-bill in the history of the company and the third highest orders, absolute order volume in the history of the company. I think it was $2.150 billion. And so it's not surprising to me. It was not surprising to us that our orders would more level at or around our sales levels here in the second quarter. In fact, I would have told you that, after such a big order number, it wouldn't have surprised me if the orders were actually a little bit lower than the sales levels. And that was probably our expectation coming into the quarter that orders would have been a little bit lower. So I'd say that the fact that we outperformed on sales and met \u2013 nearly met those sales levels with orders, is a good reflection of the demand from our customers. In terms of the cadence throughout the quarter, I wouldn't say that there's anything so notable. The middle of the quarter is probably a little lighter than the beginning and the end of the quarter. That's maybe the only thing I would say. And regional, I don't think there was anything abnormal or anomalous from a regional perspective relative to orders. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Your Q3 guide is clearly about consensus and quite strong. But when you adjust for the $5 million in M&A and the incremental FX benefit, the guide is also somewhat subseasonal. Can you talk about what sort of dynamics are causing that? Did you see -- I know you addressed this on industrial, but more broadly, did you see any pull forward, if so, in any of the end markets and how large that might have been? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, I'll point to a couple of markets to describe this and maybe with a little bit more specificity. I talked already about mobile devices. Where I would say that, the demand that we saw in the second quarter did reflect some catch-up from the disruption that we experienced in China in the first quarter, so that maybe one piece of the puzzle. I think the second is, I would talk about IT datacom and I mentioned that we expect IT datacom, expect that market to be down in the kind of mid-teens quarter-to-quarter, and that is just a reflection of the extraordinary level of demand that we had here in the second quarter. I mean these are still very, very high levels of IT datacom demand in the third quarter. Traditionally, you would see IT datacom strengthening into the second half. And the fact that there was this very significant and I would say, incremental demand, not pull ahead per se. Again, this is that nuance of a pull-in, the bandwidth requirements that emerged in the second quarter and even late in the first quarter was not customers around the world saying, 'Oh, we had originally planned to put this bandwidth in, in the second half, let's put it in the first half. This is a new demand for bandwidth because all of us are on video calls all the time because all of us are working from home, schools are teaching remotely and governments are working remotely. Hospitals are communicating remotely. I mean just an intense demand for bandwidth that nobody knew was going to exist as of January 22, which was the day before Wuhan was locked down for the pandemic. And so that's -- I wouldn't call that a pull-in, I would call that incremental demand that was very significant in the second quarter that we uniquely were able to satisfy from our customers and that moderates somewhat in the third quarter, but moderates still to a very high level of demand. And I think those are probably the biggest areas where -- which impacts the sequential guidance into the third quarter. Without that, otherwise, you would probably be looking at a much more typical and even little bit of recovery coming into the second quarter because I also talked about the fact that we see a very strong recovery in military in the second quarter. We see a very strong recovery in automotive, those two markets, which were more dramatically impacted. Where we don't see that recovery is in commercial air, luckily for us that's a much smaller percent of our sales and has much less impact. But if you think about the markets that were deeply impacted by the pandemic in the quarter, we see very strong recoveries from both military and from automotive, but not from com air. So I think you take all that together, kind of put it into the calculator and you end up with a guide that we have, which I think is a very strong guide, but does reflect essentially at similar levels, roughly similar levels to what we achieved here in the second quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikolay Todorov from Longbow. Your line is open. Nikolay Todorov : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to -- can you guys speak a little bit about your assessment of customer inventories? And I know we're going back to just questions of pull forward and not so. But I'm particularly interested in the IT datacom, mobile devices and industrial end markets. If I look at the mobile devices and combined kind of the guide through the third quarter, essentially implies that your sales are going to be a roughly flattish where production is down about 15%. And I understand part of this is content growth. But similarly, on the industrial side, if we assume that some of that medical demand is going to subside or at least flatten into the second half. What are you seeing in your nonmedical industrial customers in terms of inventory situation at their docs? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks so much, Nikolay. I mean, as I've said before, we don't have perfect visibility into our customers' warehouses and to how much inventory they have. We get a little bit of visibility from our distributors, but distributors represent just a bit over 15% of our sales. And I would tell you, vis-\u00e0-vis our distributors, the inventory levels are very healthy. There's nothing abnormal about them. I wouldn't say that they ticked up or ticked down in any meaningful way here in the second quarter. I mean as it relates to IT datacom, again, I don't know the numbers, but I can tell you, I would be pretty surprised if our customers in IT datacom put anything that we ship to them on the shelf of a warehouse. I mean, this was a dramatic need for product to be put in the field so that people like you and I would not see a spinning circle when we turn to Netflix on in the evening. And if it's sitting in -- if our product is sitting in a warehouse, it's not helping someone get bandwidth. And so I would be very surprised if any of that stuff ended up building inventory. Mobile devices is really -- there's very little inventory in the whole channel. So I don't think that that's one that I would note. And relative to industrial, I think industrial is the one market for us, especially when you take out medical, where we have a little bit of a higher proportion of distribution. And so there, I guess, I could be have a little bit more visibility than normal, and I would tell you that the inventory levels seemed healthy and reasonable and no abnormal changes as we came into, or out of the quarter, at least relative to the distribution side of our industrial business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Adam Norwitt : Hello, Deepa. Deepa Raghavan : Hey. Are you able to speak specifically to Chinese -- to China's trends versus overall? And my question is more geared towards gauging how much of the forward momentum in China is predicated on U.S. and Europe recovery supporting that? And I guess the second part of the question is, are there any verticals -- are there some verticals that are more at-risk if these developed nations remain pressured? I mean just -- it doesn't feel like China is enough there to decouple from Europe or U.S.? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Deepa. Well, look, it should not surprise anybody that after the first quarter where because of the pandemic, our China operations were shutdown for three weeks and then ramping up over the course of the following month that there was significant sequential increase in our sales in Asia and in general and specifically in China. I mean, that is normal. And mobile devices is the best example of that, which is essentially all fulfilled in China, and that grew 47% sequentially. You talked about, is that momentum tied to the U.S. and Europe, or just broadly around the world, all -- most of the mobile devices in the world are made in China, the vast majority. And so to the extent that people in U.S. or Europe buy more or less phones, that's going to impact demand there. So I guess in that market, I would say that's the case. The IT datacom market is another one where there is more -- there's a certain degree of production in China that shift around the world. And so again, I think that would be one where it's not just a Chinese domestic market. Now, I know you've alluded to kind of decoupling and -- which is a little bit of a different topic than just the kind of recovery in the second quarter. And I'll just say one thing about that. We read the papers like everybody. We're very close to all of the geopolitics of the moment. And I've said before and I will just say it again here today. The way that we organize our company has always been. We are a global company, but we rely on local management around the world to execute. That is we give authority to our more than 120 general managers around the world to make all the decisions that they need to make in order to adapt to their local markets. And we don't have expats. We have local people in every geography. We have Indians in India; Germans in Germany; French people in France; and Chinese people in China; Americans in the U.S. And that approach has always been a very, very successful approach in a globalizing world, but it is equally successful and equally powerful in a world which is decoupling, so to speak, or fragmenting or becoming more nationalistic or whatever -- however, you would like to term that. And our people in every country that they operate are viewed very much as a local supporter of those customers. Even if behind them, the customers know that they have the strength, the breadth, the financial stability, the resources of a global company, and that puts us in really a best of both world's position. And so to the extent the relations between one country and another start to deteriorate -- whatever that is, we at Amphenol remain very agnostic to that. I mean yes, do I want -- do I think the world personally is better if everybody gets along? Sure. That I would be lying if I said the opposite. But can Amphenol succeed regardless? There is no doubt about it. That's how we've turned this company. That's how we've built the culture of this company. That's how our organization is equipped. And I think in the current world, it really creates actually an opportunity for our company long-term. We're not going to shy away from the fact that we're an American headquartered company that we're traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But we are always going to make sure that our customers in every geography get from us the superior presence of a local team and all what that entails. And so I think to the extent that this decoupling happens, it is what it is. It's well above my pay grade, I can tell you. But we're going to make sure that our team can manage either way to find great success. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Hi Steve. Steven Fox : Hi. I was just wondering, you touched on some of the dynamics going on with IT datacom. I was wondering if you could do the same thing for the outdoor markets with wireless infrastructure and broadband. How would you sort of compare and contrast the need for bandwidth there and your content gains going forward for the rest of the year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. Look I would say that if you compare broadband and mobile networks in kind of the acute situation of the last, let's call it, four months, five, four and a half or so months where everybody has been working from home, I think the pressure has been more on the core Internet, the pressure has been more on the broadband service providers than it has been necessarily on the mobile service providers. And I say that because the fact is the real bandwidth constraints have come from people at home, where the vast majority of the people still today at home are not using wireless broadband as a means to deliver high-speed Internet to their house. Now that can change. And I think maybe this whole situation is going to be a catalyst for that long-term to change, because I can tell you, myself, and I won't name my cable operator. They are all wonderful but it was not always easy over the last four months. When I had two or three kids in the house, all on Zoom calls, when I was on Zoom Call, my wife was on Zoom Call, I mean \u2013 or Teams or Google or whatever, I mean, we're all on video calls and that was not always perfect. And then my son decides to play a video game and all of a sudden, the whole thing just freezes up. And so the fact is there is a real rush to help that at-home capacity over the last quarter. And I think that was reflected more in what we saw with broadband growing 12% quarter-to-quarter as opposed to mobile networks. Because in mobile networks, what we saw was really a growth from our OEM customers, and we grew 9% sequentially, which was very strong, given that. Some of that a little bit coming out of China, where some of the equipment providers in China were, of course, shut down. But in terms of our work directly with service providers, the strength really came in broadband and in IT datacom in the second quarter. Now what does that mean long term? I do believe that long term, the fact of this pandemic coming at the same time as 5G is really beginning to be constructed, it is probably a good thing. It's going to mean ultimately that we're going to have a variety of means to get broadband data to our homes. And that is not just confined to cable systems, to telco operators, to mobile operators. But there's also satellite Internet being put up in a relatively big way by certain pretty famous operators. I mean, there's a lot going on here to make sure that our \u2013 that homes can have much better bandwidth capacity than they may have in the past. And regardless of where it is, you know this well, you've covered us for a long, long time, Steve. I mean, our approach has never been to bet on one of those ways of getting high speed. It's been \u2013 our approach has always been, let's make sure we're present everywhere. Let's make sure we're present with the broadband operators. Let's make sure we're present with the mobile network operators. Let's make sure we're present with the web service providers. Let's make sure we're present with satellite-based Internet. Whatever it may be, and I think as long as we maintain that high-technology partnership with customers across each of those areas, we're going to be well positioned as the world continues to build the infrastructure for bandwidth to homes, to offices, to governments, to hospitals and everywhere around the world. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open. William Stein : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can elaborate, Adam, on capacity. I think you mentioned that this was still somewhat of a constraint in the quarter. Did I miss here? I thought that as of the end of last quarter, that these issues have been resolved at least internally, maybe it's more a matter of your customers' capacity. Any sort of clarification would be great? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks, Will. No, I mean, I would tell you that as we came out of last quarter, I mean, you'll recall, the first quarter was really a story of China and the very significant kind of one-off of the factories there. It was without equal. There was no essential business. There was nothing. It was just \u2013 they were shut down for three weeks. And then you had to reopen through a very complex and cumbersome process, actually, to prove that you were protecting your people, and we did just a great job of that, and thereby, we're able to open maybe a little bit faster than some others. But as the virus spread around the world to the nearly 40 countries in which we operate, there was a whole range of restrictions that ultimately did impact our capacity, our productivity in a whole variety of countries and not just the nearly 40 countries, but even here in the U.S., we operate in dozens of states in the U.S. and every state had a slightly different approach. I remember very well the day that the very first restrictions were taken, and that was not even a state level restriction. It was a county. Where Contra Costa, and I think it was Alameda counties in California adopted the very first real significant business restrictions to enable better social distancing and to stop the spread of the virus. And so, our teams around the world in our more than 200 facilities, it's hard to find one where we didn\u2019t, at one point, face something during the quarter where the team had to somehow navigate a government restriction or actually just us taking measures to protect the people that were important and appropriate measures to protect our people. And so, no doubt about it, in the quarter, there were significant expenses that we incurred. Craig talked about those. And there was also impact on our capacity in a variety of ways. And I talked about that in a few of our markets, but the one in particular that I mentioned was in military, where our sales were down 20%, and that had nothing to do with demand. That was all to do with navigating the variety of restrictions that were put in place in a variety of countries and our team just did a fabulous job of doing so. Now as we came out of the quarter, I would say that it's a much better situation. It's not totally done. There we still have a number or, let's say, several places around the world that are still facing some restrictions. And who knows? To the extent that the later part of the year or the latter part of the year, brings a further acceleration of the virus. Ultimately, we all know that the only way to control this virus is for people to wear masks and to have social distancing. And that ultimately may require governments to implement, again, restrictive measures that can have an impact on our customers and can have an impact on us. And that's one of the levels of uncertainty that, to be honest, makes it difficult for us to give a full year guidance. So who knows what will come? I cross my fingers and my toes that that it doesn't get worse, but I'm realistic enough to know that this is a virus that doesn't just kind of stop magically. It stops through social distancing. It stops through mask wearing. That's what our people are doing. And to the extent that governments around the world have problems that they face, where the virus gets out of control, they won't surprise me, if ultimately, there is an impact on the production of products, on businesses being able to operate. And we're not necessarily immune to that. But regardless, there's no doubt about it that in this kind of very unique world, a world where we've never had to deal with governments telling you, you can or cannot open your factories. Our team just did an amazing job of navigating those very tricky shoals here in the quarter. And if something else were to come, I'm sure they'll do the same great job. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Joseph Spak : I wanted to maybe just zoom out a little bit for a second because over the past couple of months, we've seen the market really dive-in and pay a lot of attention, increasing attention, I'd say to alternative powertrains for transportation, be it for the lighter commercial vehicle markets, but also things like hydrogen for industrial uses, particularly with the news out of Europe. So these are clearly long-term trends, but maybe sometimes market enthusiasm can get out over its skis on the opportunity. So can you speak to what you're seeing from your customer on these sort of things and whether something like hydrogen is even an opportunity for Amphenol? Adam Norwitt : Well look, these are all exciting things. And I remember years ago, when we were working on the first electric cars that we worked on as it -- I wonder if there's ever going to be an electric car that people will actually own and drive. And now I look out in our parking lot here because I have a beautiful view of our parking lot out of my office window, and I see a few of these electric cars, more than I ever did before. So you talked about something like hydrogen or fuel cells, you talked about alternative energy sources of whatever for cars. I think long term, there will be new drivetrains. I think there will be new technologies. And I think regardless of what it is, the great thing about these revolutionary new technologies is that they always require a new type of interconnect. They require a more ruggedized, they require a higher technology solutions. And so they create opportunities for our company. They create opportunities for our whole industry. And I think that's a really good thing. Now I thought you're going to ask Joe, that given the pandemic and social distancing, is that going to have an impact on these things? I think there's a chance. Look, I'm not the one to tell you which way the auto market is going to go and which way drivetrains are going to go. But these last 6 months here, and it is really 6 months ago from tomorrow that Wuhan was shutdown. These have been really unbelievable, an unbelievable time period of change. It's causing people to reassess everything. I compare it at home to it like someone throws a bag of flower in the air and you just don't know where the flower is going to land, but it will eventually land somewhere. And I do believe that people are totally reassessing aspects of their life. And some of those may ultimately result in driving these trends accelerate a bit more. And what I mean by that? Well, take public transport. I'm a huge fan of public transport, anybody should be. But the fact is, once you know that an invisible thing like a virus can be spread through a dense public transport. On the margin, it's going to probably cause people to use public transport a little bit less and that's not great for the environment. But at the same time, people are waking up to these kind of existential threats, having a pandemic really makes you very quickly get clarity on things that can affect your life. And the environment is clearly one of those things. And I believe that it will be a missed opportunity for people not to, sort of, wake up a little bit about the environment. So you take that combination of maybe people wanting to be a little bit more in the privacy and the sanctity of their own vehicles, together with a little bit of a wake-up call about existential threats to humanity would make one think a little bit more about a hydrogen fuel cell, for example, or electric vehicle or something like that. Now I don't want to go totally off the reservation on this discussion. But the fact is, is this time period can be a catalyst for change, and a lot of that change can be very exciting change. And regardless of what it's going to be our company, I believe, is very well-positioned to take part in that, to capitalize upon it and help to enable it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shawn Harrison from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : Hi everybody. Adam, I wanted to dig in just on your comments on the wireless networks business. And you said, it would weaken both at the OEM as well as the service provider level in the back half. How much of the weakness is just a tough sequential comparison versus maybe some pauses you're seeing in deployments? And if you are seeing any pauses, is that just through the end of the calendar year and then 2021 looks better for that business? Any kind of commentary would be appreciated? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I mean, look, I guess there's a little bit of each, Shawn. I would say that if you're a big company who is dealing with massive increases, a bandwidth demand, and you're facing constrained capital. You may be allocating some of that capital towards that bandwidth as opposed to expansion of a next-generation mobile network. And I think there's a little bit of that on the margin. There's been a lot of corporate goings and comings. I think a lot of those things have been settled now. But I think it's a little bit of each as we come here into the third quarter. Look, I think long-term, our outlook for this market remains to be a very positive one. We have a strong position, both with OEMs and operators. And in particular, a strong position, on next-generation systems. We've had that difficult comparison for a couple of quarters now because of the restrictions that were put in place in China, and that will continue here for really through this year. But by and large, I would tell you that we still have a very positive outlook for the market long-term. And there's a couple of dynamics that you described are probably a pretty good way to capture what's happening here in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. Adam, in the past, sometimes there have been times where, like in mobility, there have been like integration of connectors and integration of antennas and integration of sockets. And then there's times when there's cyclically like expansion of those sockets, whether it be technologies like 4G or 3G or integration of, say, Wi-Fi and all these different things. As you look forward, say, in the mobility segment, at times where you've mentioned there's been some integration that has kind of been pressured. I wonder with 5G, can you give us any color about -- does that give you a chance for like more socket wins and more content per item versus in the past or how can we think about that? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Jim. Well, look, 5G, and I think I've talked about this in the past, the good news about 5G is 5G is not a replacement to prior modes of devices communicating with networks; it's a supplement because you cannot just have a device which only communicates using 5G. It would be useless outside of just a couple of areas. And you have this kind of chicken and egg that you can't -- the network is not useful without the devices, but the devices are also not useful without the network. And thus, the devices have to be backwards compatible all the way through all the generations. You drive from Manhattan to San Francisco and in between there, you're going to go through a lot of areas that may not even have 4G, LTE, may not even have 3G. And maybe it will still be 2G kind of a communication and so -- but your phone still have to work. You still have to be able to call 911 and you still have to be able to look on Google Maps and these kind of things. And so the fact is, is adding a 5G functionality increases the complexity of the device. Now, that's a generality. Obviously, each device itself, each customer, each program is going to have a different architecture, a different approach to designing that. And whether that's going to cause more connectors or cable assemblies, or less, more antennas or less, more mechanisms or less, you cannot draw just a very perfect generalization about that. You can say that in its totality, you would expect 5G to add to the complexity and would expect that that would create further opportunities. But you can't assure yourself that on each program, that's going to be the case. So, I think 5G net-net is a great positive, and it's a great positive for us, not just in the devices, but it's also a positive because we work in the networks. And it's also a positive because we work in the core -- at the core Internet where we have such a strong position as well. And so we think 5G has the potential to impact virtually all of the segments of our business. You talk about Internet in factories, and you talk about adopting high-speed data into new medical devices, you talk about how it works even in the military, what the military is going to do when you have 5G functionality, all of these things are creating new applications, new functionalities, which ultimately are going to need new interconnect solutions that Amphenol can provide. So the long-term prospects, I think, from 5G are very pervasive and very positive. Ultimately, is a given phone or a given tablet going to have more or less of the things that we sell? It's impossible to say in the short-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Kelley : Hey good afternoon. A question on automotive. And Adam, you talked about visibility to substantial sales improvement in Q3, do you foresee any supply chain risk to meeting that ramp? And then realizing there's unlikely to impact the near-term, but given the magnitude and timing of this rebound, is this an opportunity for Amphenol to take market share from competitors that might still be feeling, let's call it, deeper effects from the Q2 disruption? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, David. Look, I think from our perspective, I don't see a risk to our team ramping up. Our team is just so nimble. They're flexing their capabilities. We saw that even during the course of the second quarter, if you think about the trajectory of the auto market, just within the second quarter. I can tell you, April was not the most fun month to be an automotive interconnect supplier. That's for sure. But by the time we came into June, we were already starting to see some recovery of momentum, and our team is able to flip a switch and really be running to satisfy that demand. Now your question about market share, I will tell you, and I'm going to broaden this to be beyond automotive. This is an existential crisis for many. I talked during my prepared remarks and we've talked so many times about the strength of the diversity of Amphenol. And you couple that with the financial fortitude that Craig has just done such an amazing job of ensuring inside this company and that has created ultimately a resilience to Amphenol that is, I believe, second to none. There are many in our industry and in other industries, but in our industry, who are more focused. And those focused companies, to the extent that they're on the wrong side of the market volatility that can create a more existential threat, and it can create in the eyes of customers, a perception of an existential threat. And that ultimately may, over time, create a kind of a draw to those customers to work with a company that demonstrates resilience in the time of true crisis. And I think in that respect, Amphenol comes out really passing that test with flying colors. And so I wouldn't just confine that to automotive, I would say, across all of our markets, our customers have seen in Amphenol, a company that can deal with the crisis like no other, and they want to have that. There's been so much talked about supply chain resiliency and as opposed to sort of efficiency versus longevity kind of that debate that people have had. And I think we've always strived to give our customers both, tried to give them a great offering of the best products at competitive prices, but also from a company that's going to be around regardless of what crisis hits us. And I think that can be a positive long-term and in particular, in a crisis that was \u2013 where the catalyst for that crisis is a public health emergency. It almost brings more focus to that dynamic than ever before. And so I think long term, that can create an opportunity for our company across all the markets, including automotive. Operator : Thank you. And our last question for today comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Just wanted to dig in on the industrial. We've touched on it a little bit, but can you maybe put a finer point on what the non-medical piece did or what that would have looked like without the benefit from medical or maybe on a size the scale, the size of medical for us in some fashion? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. I mean, look, we don't break out every detail of all of our industrial market. It would be \u2013 it would make this phone call to go for hours. But I will tell you that we had strong performance in a number of our important industrial segments beyond medical. I mentioned, specifically instrumentation, heavy equipment. We had great performance also in our sort of battery related applications for heavy vehicles. And conversely, we had other parts of the industrial market that were more impacted, things like oil and gas, as I referred to before. But medical was not the only story in industrial. And I think we would have still had a good performance in industrial, even without that medical, especially if you think about on a sequential basis, growing 17% sequentially in that market. I mean, that that could not have come from just one piece of that industrial puzzle, which was medical. So I think we still have strong positions across industrial. And what has really been the basis of our industrial market is the diversification within that very, very broad market, and what ties industrial all together, remains, these are just harsh environment applications, where you're taking high technology interconnect and sensor products, antenna products, and you're putting them into very inhospitable environments. Everything from down in oil wells, to a very clean ICU in a hospital and everything in between, and we have great performance in many segments of that market. And the diversity within that market I think helps us to have that strong performance. Operator : Thank you, speakers. As at this time we don't have any further questions on queue, I'll hand the call over to you for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much and thanks to everybody for your attention to Amphenol today and just like to take this opportunity to wish you all a good summer. I hope you get some well deserved vacation time this summer. You'll need it to come back fully recharged for the second half and Craig and I look forward to speaking to you all 90 days from now. Thanks again. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,323 million, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively. Sales were up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2019. Sales in the third quarter increased by 9% organically, and sequentially, sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies inorganically. Breaking down sales into our two segments, the interconnect business which comprised 96% of our sales was up 11% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable business which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 2% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $476 million in the third quarter of 2020. Operating margins were 20.5%, which was up a very strong 250 basis points sequentially, and up 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. The strong sequential improvement in margins reflected a healthy conversion on the higher sales levels, as well as an expected significant reduction in the impact of COVID-related costs. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, which increased from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019, and 20% in the third quarter - in the second quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.7%, which increased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2019, and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Given the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely proud of this quarter's performance. Our team's ability to manage through all the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture and which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million, which was down from $30 million in the third quarter of last year. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including an excess tax benefit of $11 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter was 22.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding the excess tax benefit just mentioned, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. Adjusted net income of $336 million was 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the company's financial performance. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 22% at $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.92 in the third quarter of 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019. Orders for the quarter were $2,275 million, which was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019, and up 15% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 to 1. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash, cash flow from operations with a strong $398 million in the third quarter or 119% of adjusted net income. Our free cash flow was $330 million or 98% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively at the end of September. And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively. All improved from the second quarter levels and all within our normal range. During the third quarter, our cash flow from operations of $398 million, along with proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $104 million were used primarily to repurchase 1.9 million shares of the company's stock for $202 million or an average price of $108, fund dividend payments of $75 million, fund net capital expenditures of $68 million, fund acquisitions of $50 million and fund net purchases of short-term investments of $9 million. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend on the company's common stock from $0.25 to $0.29 per share. This increase is effective for payments beginning in January of 2021. At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.5 billion, the majority of which is held outside of the U.S. Total debt at September 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021 and net debt at September 30 was $2.4 billion. Total cash on hand, plus the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $4 billion at the end of the quarter. And third quarter EBITDA was $568 million and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. I will now turn it back to Adam who will provide some commentary on current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody here today at the time of our third quarter earnings release. And first and foremost, I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and most importantly, discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2020. With respect to the third quarter, and amidst what has been clearly an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we at Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, realizing level significantly above our guidance that we issued just 90 days ago. Sales reached $2,323 million, an increase from prior year of 11% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies, and 9% organically. The strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT datacom, industrial, military, broadband and the automotive markets, and was offset partially by declines in the commercial air and mobile networks markets. We are particularly proud to have achieved a very robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter which was significantly higher than our original expectations. As Craig mentioned, the company booked $2,275 million in orders and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1. Now despite experiencing some continued operational challenges related to the pandemic, we generated excellent operating margins of 20.5% in the third quarter, and this was a full 250 basis point increase from our second quarter levels. Just want to say that the company's financial position remains extremely strong, with our operating cash flow of $398 million, and that was particularly notable given the stronger than expected sequential growth from the second quarter. And we continue to leverage that financial strength to return capital to our shareholders, both through our repurchase last quarter of 1.9 million shares of the company's stock, as well as the Board of Directors' approval of a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend that we are announcing today. I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. No question in my mind that the record results this quarter clearly demonstrate the true value of the agility, the discipline, and the drive of our entrepreneurial organization. Now turning to the trends across our served markets, I would just comment that as we've seen this year so far, Amphenol's balanced and broad end market diversification is a uniquely valuable asset, especially in times of heightened economic uncertainty. As many of our markets began to recover in the third quarter, we were able to quickly capitalize on the growth opportunities in those markets, while still retaining our broad exposure to new opportunities and new technology developments across all areas of the electronics industry. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by 6% from prior year, driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval, space, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a strong 30% as we recovered from the impact of production restrictions that hit certain of our facilities related to government measures implemented in the second quarter to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels, and for the full year of 2020, we expect a low single-digit increase in sales from prior year. This full year performance reflects our leading market position and strong execution, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic related production restrictions we experienced in the first half of 2020. I'm very proud of our team working in the military market around the world. They have maintained a singular focus on ensuring that our defense industry customers have uninterrupted access to our leading high technology interconnect products which are - which are critical to our customers' equipment. We are encouraged both by the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems together with the overall favorable defense spending environment. The investments that we've made over the last several years in both new technologies and the capabilities to produce them at volume have positioned us very strongly to be able to capitalize on these trends for many years to come. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales were down by 40%, a very significant level, as the commercial aircraft market once again experienced unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, rising 4% from the second quarter. As we look ahead though, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel, which is occurring around the world. Accordingly, we expect an approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2020, we expect a roughly 35% decline from prior year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions that our customers are experiencing. No question that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry and that that's having a serious impact on the market for commercial airplanes in the near term. Nevertheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems integrated into those airplanes, and we remain well positioned when this market eventually does return to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to the industrial market exceeded our expectations, increasing by 21% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance. This robust growth was driven especially by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments, really a broad base of growth that we saw in the industrial market. Although we had expected sales to be modestly lower than the second quarter, we actually realized 11% sequential growth during the third quarter, a very strong performance. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline from these third quarter sales levels. Nevertheless, for the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit increase in sales from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market environment. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment, managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment or executing on unprecedented demand for next generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers around the world are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we look towards the long-term, I'm confident that our performance through this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future. And importantly, we continue to drive our leading development of next generation interconnect sensor and antenna products in support of our customers in the industrial market, who in turn are accelerating their adoption of next generation technologies. The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the third quarter. After a truly challenging second quarter during which the global automotive industry was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very pleased to have seen a very strong recovery here in the third quarter, with results much better than we had originally anticipated coming into the quarter. Our team's outstanding execution led to an increase in sales from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, well ahead of our expectations. Sequentially, our sales increased by truly significant 78% from the second quarter, as our team was able to execute quickly on a recovery in demand from automotive customers in all regions. Looking now into the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels. For the full year 2020, we expect a low double-digit reduction in sales, which does reflect the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn and demand from automotive OEMs that we saw in the first half. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has clearly demonstrated, both agility and resiliency in realizing the strong sequential growth levels. In fact, our performance through this crisis makes me even more confident in our long-term prospects in the automotive market. We've continued to expand our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all with the goal of enabling a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will no doubt continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter and our sales to mobile device customers increased by a stronger than expected 25% from prior year, driven in particular by increased sales of products incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables, and this was offset in part by slightly lower year-over-year sales to smartphones. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 37%, and this was driven by higher sales across all the products that we serve. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels, and for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the low double digits from 2019. And I would just note that this is well above our original expectations as we came into the year before we were hit with the pandemic. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in the fourth quarter or beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, and this positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales decreased as we had expected from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically, driven by lower sales to wireless operators, as well as some continued impact from the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese entities that we have previously discussed. On a sequential basis, our sales reduced by 9% on overall lower spending by both operators and OEMs. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a further seasonal sales reduction of approximately 25% related to both OEMs and service providers. And for the full year, we expect a high teens reduction in sales, which reflects the impact of the U.S. government restrictions, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of the near-term challenges in the mobile networks market, we're confident in the company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next generation equipment and networks. As customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter once again much better than we had anticipated, rising from prior year by a very strong 24% in U.S. dollars and 21% organically. And this growth was really driven from increased demand for data traffic that continue to prompt both our OEM and service provider customers to increase their demand across virtually all segments of the IT datacom market. Sequentially, sales were down by a less than expected 10% from our extremely strong second quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a mid-teens sequential decline from these very strong third quarter levels, and for the full year 2020, we expect sales to increase in the low teens, reflecting the significant upside in demand we experienced in both the second and third quarters, offset in part by the pandemic-related disruptions we saw in the first quarter. Our team working in support of the IT datacom market has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop our broad range of industry-leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Indeed, we remain very encouraged by the company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 5% from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a stronger than expected 13%, as our customers continue to upgrade their networks in support of the increased demand for high-speed data. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to moderate from these levels on typical end of the year seasonality. And for the full year 2020, we expect sales to be roughly flat with prior year, and this reflects the pandemic-related disruptions we experienced in certain geographies, offset by increased investments by our customers in support of higher bandwidth demand. Now turning to our outlook for the future. While our performance in the third quarter was very strong, there still remain significant uncertainties in the global market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which does appear to be worsening in some regions of the world. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2,160 million to $2,200 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.98 to $1. This represents both sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth versus prior year of flat to up 2%. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full year sales of $8,333 million to $8,373 million, and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $3.59 to $3.61. This outlook represents sales growth versus prior year of 1% to 2%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 3% to 4%. The expected decline in our earnings relates directly to the significant cost and disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that the company faced particularly during the first half of 2020. Now let me just say that I'm extremely pleased by Amphenol's performance in the third quarter, especially our team's achievement of these new quarterly records in both sales and earnings. Most importantly, I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace, and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I just want to assure you that our entire organization remains committed to fighting hard to secure the company's financial performance, all while dedicating ourselves wholeheartedly to protecting the safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And as a final note, I would just like to take this opportunity here today to thank every one of our Amphenolians around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thank you and congrats on the strong execution you guys. I guess, my question is really, when I look at the strength, we saw in September quarter, I think it was one of the largest B2C in out of you guys in a few years. I guess, Adam, could you just touch upon what surprised you and drove the upside versus 90 days ago? Was it just better end demand or did you see inventory build happy at customers or perhaps is more allocation shift that came your way since competition couldn't execute? It would be helpful to get some context on what drove this impressive 10% to 11% growth and sort of how would you characterize that, because the question I keep getting asked is, why aren't we seeing a follow - follow through of this growth in the December quarter guide? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I think you listed a few factors, and I think there is a little bit of each of them in the third quarter with maybe the exception that I can't tell you that we saw any inventory build of significance so that we had at least visibility to in the quarter. But no question, in several of our markets, demand was much stronger than we had anticipated. I think we outperformed maybe some of our peers in certain of those areas where we were able to capitalize on the demand in a faster fashion. So you take the example of mobile devices where we came into the quarter expecting a relatively modest sequential growth, and mobile devices is always the market that's very hard to anticipate, but our team drove 37% sequential growth in mobile devices and that came both from volume demands from our customers, but also from the fact that there were instances where our customers couldn't get everything they needed from other folks, and they could get it from us. And I think that's something that we've demonstrated in many years in the past. Our teams have the outstanding agility in reacting to unexpected levels of demand. We clearly did not anticipate coming into the quarter that we would have such significant sequential growth in automotive, and in fact, we have grown on a year-over-year basis in automotive after that just very, very challenging second quarter that we all saw was a real testament again to the agility of our team to satisfy what was unexpected levels of demand. But look - as you look at our guide for the fourth quarter, and I know you, as you mentioned Amit, why does that - what is going on with that guide, we do this as we always have done. We talk to our customers and this is a bottoms-up approach to how we forecast. There are certain markets where there were real surges in demand earlier in the year. IT datacom another example of that, where we've guided IT datacom to be down in kind of the mid-teens in the fourth quarter, it was down a lot less than we anticipated here in the third quarter. There was the real surge in demand for data bandwidth - for bandwidth upgrades and support of data traffic to support all of the work from home and study from home requirements around the world related to the pandemic. And that's normally not a market that would be down by so much in the fourth quarter, but it's also normally not a market that would have grown so much in the second and third quarters. So we've done our best here amidst this environment to take everything that our customers say. We add that up to the outlook that we've given you. And knowing full well that there - we are not out of the woods relative to the pandemic, there is still a pandemic going on. It is in fact worsening in certain areas. And I think our customers are sensitive to that, and our team is prepared if there is some further surprise, further operational challenges that will come, but we think this is actually a very, very strong outlook relative to the extraordinary strength that we saw here in the third quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Luke Junk from Baird. Your line is open. Luke Junk : My question is on the auto business, and I'm just curious in the wake of COVID, whether you're seeing a shift and focus in your auto customers, given your engineering labor relationships. Just wondering if anything has shifted in terms of focus related to electrification, autonomous driving or similar as far as you can see? Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I think that that shift towards new drivetrains, towards autonomous, other new technologies that are going into the car, I mean, we have continued to see that for many years. I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen an acute change in the trajectory of that evolution here in 2020 due to COVID. I think what we saw in the third quarter was customers really scrambling to get back into their production levels, and customers probably buying more cars than people anticipated. There seems to have developed some degree of pent-up demand for automotive production. I have heard anecdotes about inventory levels being low, that it's difficult to get a pick-up truck in Michigan and things like this. And I'm sure, Luke, you know you're closer to this market than we are, and you know very well, some of those dynamics. But there's no question that there is real demand from customers and they continue to drive new programs that have been in the pipeline. But is the pandemic itself responsible for a kind of distinct shift, I wouldn't say that is. Now, I would also just add that our team around the world has done a fabulous job in positioning ourselves in these new platforms, while we haven't forsaken the traditional drivetrains, the internal combustion engines, and otherwise, we continue to support our customers who are manufacturing these would still represent the vast majority of vehicles that are being produced around the world. But our team has done such a great job on developing new products, expanding our relationship with customers really in all geographies such that to the extent there is an acceleration of that shift, I think, Amphenol is well positioned to benefit from it. Operator : Next question is coming from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the very strong 3Q results. So I mean, to better understand the EBIT margins, I mean, there have been some constraints the company was facing, acquired companies that came in initially at lower margins, and some extra costs around COVID that have been weighing on margins earlier this year, but the company had very strong EBIT margins in the third quarter. So I'm going to better understand to what extent there are still headwinds that the company is trying to contend with? Clearly on an overall basis was able to overcome those, but are there still any challenges around integrating that new assets or COVID costs that are still a drag to EBIT margins? And perhaps if you could talk about it with some perspective on how to think about that going forward? And you mentioned there is still some increase in COVID cases. Is there anything we need to be thinking about around COVID weighing on margins either in 4Q or potentially into next year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Great. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for the question. No - I mean, no doubt, we are really proud of our ability to achieve these strong operating margins of 20.5% here in the third quarter and 250 basis point improvement over Q2 or 18% and certainly 80 basis points even over the last year when COVID really wasn't a thing. So we're certainly very proud of that. I mean, as I did mention in my prepared remarks, we did have strong conversion on our higher kind of sales levels that certainly had a benefit from a profitability perspective, but it also reflected sequentially our expected reduction in COVID related costs in the quarter. I mean, we certainly still are experiencing some turbulence in the business related to COVID and the cost that that creates, but certainly it is at a much lower level than it was in the first and second quarter. But there is no doubt, there still is some costs that we are experiencing. The team is doing an outstanding job of navigating that and minimizing that to the extent possible, but there are certainly also puts and takes within the P&L. And as an example, there is other costs such as T&E, as an example, that does have some offsetting impact at this lower level of COVID cost. So what I would say is, from a net impact in the third quarter, really that COVID related and kind of these puts and takes, some talking about really didn't have a meaningful impact kind of in the third quarter on our margin. So you mentioned acquisitions - any acquisition impact, I would say that, although we continue to spend time on that, this year, certainly due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to make certainly the progress that we would hope to have made in this year related to some of the acquisitions we acquired in '19. So I wouldn't say that really has had so much of impact in the third quarter either. If you kind of look at year-over-year, it's really more of that leverage on the sales increase. And going forward, I think that I would expect kind of our normal conversion on the upside and downside, you know that 25%, 30% on the downside, which I think I would expect. And that assumes certainly that we don't have this resurgence, you know that of significance in the pandemic. We - always certainly if we do have additional costs, we're going to work hard to continue to mitigate those, but I'm certainly real proud of what the team has done so far to do that and we'll keep an eye on that in the future. But again, real outstanding performance here in the quarter. The team has done a fantastic job of navigating all these things that are happening in the world. Operator : Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : If you step back to pre-COVID at the beginning of the year, your thought that you would do about $8.3 billion in revenue and $3.80 in EPS. Now you expect fairly similar revenue, EPS is about $0.40 lower for the year. Is all the differential, just incremental costs associated with COVID, and if so, should we expect that next year we should see faster EPS growth as your conversion margins now overcome the COVID headwinds as you did in the third quarter? And if I could, in the fourth quarter, mobile devices, Adam, you had mentioned in 3Q that you were slightly down on smartphones and laptops, tablets and wearables drove the growth. I was wondering if those similar comments also hold for the fourth quarter guidance? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks Wamsi. Yes, I would say that, all that differential really is the COVID related costs that we incurred in the first half. And if you kind of look at the first half year-over-year from an EPS versus - perspective and kind of conversion on those sales differentials that really is all the COVID related cost, you know we talked about that in the last couple of quarters. So, yes, as we go into 2021, we're not giving guidance here, but certainly we would expect at least at this point based on the - guidance for Q4 that those costs would not be in there. But again, we talked about a minute ago about these potential resurgences throughout the world, so will give our guidance in January and certainly we'll talk about what we expect there. But it is all COVID related and we're really happy to be kind of at those pre-COVID profitability levels here in the third quarter, and again, proud of what the team has done thus far. Craig Lampo : Yes. And Wamsi just a short answer to your second question. I mean, it's hard enough to forecast mobile devices and learn to forecast it based on the individual components of it. I wouldn't think anything is categorically different in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but it - we have - anyway it's a hard time to forecast it in general. So I wouldn't get too far out ahead of myself in saying which individual segments are going to be strong in the fourth quarter. Operator : Next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Adam, I just wanted to kind of ask you on a more broad level, and I think you touched on this a couple of times passingly, like, how are customers responding to the risk of a second wave here on the pandemic and what are you baking in, in terms of your guidance for the fourth quarter related to that, because the reason I ask is, we've seen a bit more volatility in the order trends this year and what in hindsight looks like, you had a strong 1Q order trend moderating in 2Q. Should we expect something similar to repeat if we have a second wave in 3Q and 4Q of this year? Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks. Thanks so much, Samik. Look, I don't know that anybody is handicapping in their production plan. What a second wave will be, what the magnitude of a second wave can be, and more importantly, what are the consumer reaction to that and what are the governmental reactions to whatever second wave will be. We certainly are not trying to guess across all of those variables what that can be. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we're very sensitive to the fact that there may be further disruptions. And thus, it's not about preparing yourself by saying, well, I'm going to add inventory, subtract inventory or otherwise, it's making sure that your entire organization is on their toes. It is remaining nimble, agile, reactive and prepared physically, psychologically for whatever may come our way. And I think that's where the Amphenol team has really excelled this year. It's not that we guessed which way the trajectory of the pandemic was going to come and thus we were able to achieve these results. It's that we were ready regardless of how it came. And I think the third quarter is just a wonderful indication of that. We didn't come into the quarter anticipating, for example, that mobile devices would grow 37% sequentially or anticipating that automotive would grow 78% sequentially or that our military business would be up 30%. But we were ready in case it were to happen, because our team was able to flex. So what do our customers - how our customers integrating a second wave into their expectations, I actually don't know. Maybe some are, maybe some are not, but how we approach this is we take what our customers tell us, and then we're ready regardless. Are we going to be right at the numbers that we have guided here? Hard to say. That's the best that we can tell right now, but this - if this year has taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected and to be ready regardless of what comes our way. And I think that's what the Amphenol team, where we sit today here in the third week of October, we're ready for whatever comes along. We continue to prioritize the health of our people. That's been number one by the way throughout this - that's what's enabled us to support our customers, that's what's allowed us to then drive the strong results. And we're going to continue to do that. And if more demand comes, we will satisfy, and if less demand comes, we will react to that as well. Operator : Next question is from Nick Todorov from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Nick Todorov : Just wanted to go back to the mobile markets, and I just wanted to see a reference of comment. Adam, I think you made last quarter, as you guys are poised to capture any incremental opportunities in 2020? So what I'm hearing from you is that you're not necessarily seeing any contribution towards this year low double-digit growth from the mobile - from the smartphone space specifically. I just wonder if anything changed here as we go into the fourth quarter and we know that some of the builds have been delayed? Has anything changed in your position or your view in specifically the smartphone market and how you play in that role? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, look, I think what I've always said and I said that last quarter, and I think I probably said it again here this quarter is, this is a hard market to forecast and to the extent that demand is higher than we anticipate, we're very much - our team is very much poised to capitalize upon that, and that's exactly what we did here in the third quarter. And while it's true that on a year-over-year basis, our growth came not from necessarily smartphones, but rather from things like laptops and tablets and wearables and otherwise. In the fourth quarter, it may very well be a different situation. We'll see as it comes. We did grow sequentially across all of those products, including strong double-digit sequential growth in our sales of products that go into smartphones. And so, our team is for sure capitalizing on whatever incremental demand there may be in smartphones. And when we talk about the incremental performance that we had in this quarter, again, growing 37% sequentially instead of just a modest growth, some of that upside was in fact coming also from smartphones even if that didn't represent growth on a year-over-year basis. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you, very much and good job, at really adjusting to a dynamic world. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Jim. Jim Suva : The question I had was a little unique question I haven't asked before, focused on it much, because it hasn't changed much and that was the book-to-bill. Normally, this quarter has been above 1. Normally, the company has seen above 1 book-to-bill. Obviously, you had - you crushed your expectations in a positive way for revenues and EPS this quarter, because some of that play into the book-to-bill or why would we see a book-to-bill given your results and also the outlook which were stronger than expected? And we trying to triangulate around that, like, if there - or is there inventory restocking going on that maybe you don't feel comfortable is going to continue or I'm trying to triangulate the book-to-bill versus your strong results and outlook and all the commentary? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks, Jim. Look, one thing I would just say about the book-to-bill, I mean 0.98 to 1 is pretty close to 1. On a year-to-date basis, if you include our very strong book-to-bill that we had in the first quarter, our book-to-bill year-to-date is 1.04 to 1, which is very, very strong compared to maybe other years. But look, does that - what does that mean for the fourth quarter, I think, we've already talked about what the - how we've gone - coming up with our fourth quarter guidance. I think these are strong bookings. They far exceeded what we thought coming into the quarter. And the fact that the book-to-bill is little bit below one is I think just a reflection that some customers placed upon us much stronger orders early in the year and there are some markets where the lead times are a little bit longer, places like military, for example, where we have very substantial order books that were shipping out of, but I wouldn't read anything abnormal into that. I think last year in the third quarter, our book-to-bill was kind of 1 to 1. So considering that this is a year where very little is normal, actually I'd say, a 0.98 to 1 book-to-bill is pretty normal compared to last year when all is said and done. And again, we shipped so strongly in the quarter. And so, the fact that we were able to execute on the backlog that we had. Had we not executed on that, we'd be talking about a positive book-to-bill. And so, I think, these were very strong bookings, but those shipments were even stronger. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Your line is open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks. Hello, Adam and Craig. My question is on the defense and aerospace markets. On the military side, you talked about seeing a return to growth, but it sounds like there is still some COVID related constraints there. So would love some commentary there? And on the aerospace segment where you're guiding down again, are you getting a sense at all that we're at a bottom there or any signs of stabilization? Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much Matt. Look, I think, on the military side, we clearly had a lot of constraints in the second quarter and that was reflected in our performance in the second quarter. We have to go back a little bit and understand we've been dealing with a very, very robust military market. You'll recall, 2019 we grew 23% in military, which is really substantial in that market. And net 23% in military required us to step up quite significantly our capacity expansions in support of this very, very strong levels of demand. And so, as we came into COVID, there was still strong demand, but then we lost a lot of production in the second quarter because of the various shutdowns in places like the U.S., in places like Mexico, places like India, and otherwise in Europe as well. And getting that back so rapidly is not as easy in the military market, when we were already running at very high levels of capacity. Now I can tell you this, we are supporting our customers in an outstanding fashion. We have not disappointed. We have not let down customers. We're not creating any problems for our customers. But overall, we are running here again in the third quarter at a very high level of production relative to capacity, and there is still significant demand that is out there. So when does that return to growth? I think our outlook for the full year to be in the kind of low single digits is a reflection of strong performance where there is one quarter where we really lost a fair bit of production in that quarter. Now relative to commercial air, I don't - I can't be the one to call a \"bottom here\". We came into this quarter thinking that our sales would sequentially be down, in fact, they were not. We were up a little bit sequentially. But what we hear from our customers for the fourth quarter is clearly that it will be down, and that's why I talked about an outlook of being down about 20%. We'll see how the year comes. It's a very difficult time period. I would - where if you call it an unprecedented disruption in demand in that market, because this demand that is disrupted, not just because of production problems but the end customers are just not using the product right now. And you just look at any area of the travel industry, and you do not have demand. And how that ultimately filters through to the aircraft unit demand going forward, I think it's too early to tell. Regardless, our team will be ready. We continue to support our customers around the world. And ultimately, one day, there will be a recovery in this demand, and our team will be well positioned to take cover. Until such time, you can bet that everybody working in commercial air in Amphenol is doing what they have to do, to deal with lower volumes, cutting cost, reallocating resources, re-dedicating technologies to other markets, all the sort of standard playbook of an Amphenol Entrepreneurial General Manager, and they're doing that in spades right now. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Wanted to dive a little bit deeper into high-voltage connectors for electric vehicles, because clearly, you've - you've mentioned that a tailwind for you and we're now seeing more programs coming to market and even more being quoted. So now that you have a little bit more experience here, can you break down what the source of that tailwind? And is it the number of connectors going up or is it - is it the same number of connectors but a higher dollar content or is it both or any additional color you can provide on that now that we're deeper into the electrification move would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, we've talked about it, I know many others have talked about the fact that the interconnect architecture and electric vehicle is very, very different from that, which is in a typical internal combustion engine vehicle, and that starts with the reality that you're moving power around the car at very high voltage and that requires a degree of technology in the interconnect that is just very different than what one saw in traditional cars. And when you have a more complex technology, when you have a technology that carries with it more risk that it has to be a good connector. Of course, that's going to - that's going to have an implication that that product should have. All things being equal, more value to it. Now is every electric car design the same? No. Is every hybrid car design the same? No. Is every internal combustion engine car design the same? For sure, not. And so, you can't say a specific model is going to have X more content than another specific model, but all things being equal, the interconnect system inside an EV car can have more value. Is that because there is more connectors while there's certainly more high-voltage connectors and those high-voltage connectors, again in general, should have greater technology embedded in them than a typically low voltage connector or cable assembly that goes into a car. So I think that that's - it's a pretty straightforward actually dynamic. Now the real rubber meets the road, so to speak, in - are you working with the breadth of customers, do you have the right technology, do you have that proven track record in high voltage products, maybe not in cars, for example, in industrial, in military like we do, and do you have the relationships with customers where you can promote those products to those customers? I think there, our team has done a really good job of that, and they've done a good job really in all the regions to make sure that customers understand that great legacy that Amphenol has in high voltage products outside of the automotive industry, coupled with our ability to service the automotive industry which has its unique requirements in terms of fulfilling the demand of customers. So I think it's a very positive for the long-term for the company, and I think we've been taking good advantage of that also here in the relatively shorter term. Operator : Next question is from Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Can you impact the auto segment a bit? You reported sales up nearly 80% sequentially, and while auto production is recovering quite sharply, it seems like you guys outperformed production by a pretty wide margin during the quarter. So was this outgrowth the reflection of maybe low OEM component inventories at the start of the quarter, share gains from Amphenol or maybe potential inventory building by the OEMs during the quarter as there could be concerns of another COVID supply chain disruption as we head into the winter? Adam Norwitt : Yes, Thanks so much. Look, I don't know about the inventory that you mentioned. It doesn't appear to me that there is a massive amount of inventory being built. Was there low dealer inventory coming into the quarter? For sure. And is that driving automakers to try to ramp up their production levels? I think that's very, very clear. Did our team to a great job to react to the demand that was put upon us by our customers? I think they did. But look, I think, it's all too early to say what the overall market is going to be here. I don't pay much heat to the various consultant reports that are put out there. I think we'll see it when we see it what the overall demand is. But this is an industry that really just shut down almost for a quarter, at least for a month or two in that quarter, and restarting into an environment where there seems to be some end demand for cars. People want to have cars and trucks and SUVs, and all of those things. And so, I think it's natural that there is a desire to quickly ramp back up and how much of our gain came because of end volumes, how much came because of share gains, how much came because of readjusting to more normalized inventory levels, it's hard for us to know what the various components of that would be. Operator : Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thank you. Adam, could you discuss just the M&A environment, I mean, certainly this year there's been a lot of external factors for Amphenol targets to navigate around as well as internally. So just how you're seeing things today, and as business does start to kind of stabilize a bit, does that change in terms of what could be actionable from an M&A perspective? Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks very much, Craig. I think we've talked about this during the more acute phases of the pandemic. And what for us has been a real advantage is, we view M&A as a very long-term process of developing and incubating relationships, keeping in touch, developing a sense of mutual trust and awareness with companies that we would be interested one day in inviting into the Amphenol family. And because of that, we've been able to do that even with the social distancing and the inability to travel. And so, our pipeline remains very strong. The relationships with the companies that we've been developing for a long time remain very robust and current. But at the same time, I think, if you're an entrepreneur, and you are - you may think twice about selling in an environment like this, because there is still a lot of uncertainty. And so, the fact that we've completed this year just two acquisitions, they are both relatively small. Last year, you know, we completed nine acquisitions, it's not surprising given that we're in a kind of once in a lifetime pandemic right now. I fully believe that as the world normalizes, whatever normal shall be, that our acquisition program will remain a really strong value creator for the company. And the fact of our performance during the pandemic, the resilience of Amphenol, our ability to capitalize on opportunities to manage through this pandemic in a way that we have becomes only a great asset in those discussions that we continue to have with potential acquisition targets and makes Amphenol incrementally a more attractive home for these companies, for their organizations. And so long-term, I actually think this might turn to a positive in terms of the wherewithal that we have to ultimately complete these acquisitions. Now when are we going to close on the next acquisition? You know well, I'm woefully unable to predict that. There are so many factors that go into when somebody ultimately signs on the dotted line, but I'm confident that over the long-term, this will be a real great part of how Amphenol grows. Over the long-term, acquisitions have represented roughly a third of our growth and we see no reason to think that that should change going forward. Operator : Our next question is from Shawn Harrison from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Shawn Harrison : Clarifications, if I may, and then just a question on kind of the bookings linearity. Does the guidance reflect any kind of incremental entity list headwinds for Amphenol? And then on the bookings linearity, if you could just kind of talk about the upside you saw, was it's something where it spiked mid quarter, end of quarter, then tailed off into October, just kind of how linear the quarter was after you guys initially guided during July? Craig Lampo : Yes, I mean, look relative to the end of the list, I think as we said a year ago, it's not that like on one day, May 19th, everything shut off. And so, there is a process of this that over time the impact can grow a little bit, and I think we continue to see that relative to the linearity of the quarter. Look, I think it shouldn't come as a terrible surprised that as we got farther from the acute phase of the pandemic which was really in the second quarter that there was some strengthening over the course of the quarter. And typically in the third quarter, September would be a really strong month, and I think this year was not different from other years in the respect that the quarter finished a bit stronger than it started. Operator : Our next question is from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Deepa Raghavan : My question is on buyback. It looks like some of the deal potential - Adam, based on your comments, it looks like some of the deals potential is being pushed out, which then clearly leave some room for further buybacks to happen perhaps even above trend. Can you comment on that? Plus, Craig, you mentioned there is - the majority of this $1.5 billion in cash is held outside the U.S., can you help us understand how much is in the U.S. and how that can influence share buybacks - share buyback potential? And also if you don't mind, please comment on how much cash you need for operations? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yes, thanks Deepa. I would - just to the point of that cash, I would say in the U.S. and how that impacts our buybacks, I would say, it really doesn't have any impact on what buybacks we do. We have plenty of liquidity in the U.S., outside of the U.S. So it really has no impact on our buyback rhythm. In terms of the amount of cash we have, and whether or not doing less M&A or more M&A has an impact on our buybacks, I mean, honestly, I would say that we have a pretty strong balance sheet, a very strong balance sheet. We've had a very strong balance sheet for a long time. I would say that regardless of the M&A that we've had over a period of time, we've been able to have a pretty balanced capital deployment rhythm in regards to share - return of capital to shareholders and our M&A. We always say that we prefer to do M&A, to the extent possible, but the reality is, is that we are able to typically do all of the three because of such a strong balance sheet, the amount of cash flow we generate. We generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow this year. So I wouldn't say that, you know, doing less M&A is necessarily going to have us accelerate our buyback. We've done 1.6 billion out of the 2 billion under our buyback program. So we're well on track to finish our buyback program in the allotted time, which certainly were on phase four. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we would per se accelerate that. M&A will continue to be a significant part of our strategy as Adam just mentioned. The timing is certainly unpredictable and - but there is no doubt that we have a great pipeline and we have certainly the capital to fund it. Operator : Next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Adam, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the industrial market guidance that you gave. I understand the conservatism, but the strength in Q3 was really good. I think it was better than you thought and it was so broad. Why the slight decline is in terms of expectations for Q4? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much Steve. I mean, look, no doubt about it. Third quarter for our industrial market was really strong and it came on the heels of a second quarter that also surpassed our expectations. And you'll remember in the second quarter, the real driver was the strength in medical. In this quarter, it was more broad, including medical, but not only including medical. And so, it was really quite a bit outperforming. We anticipate that we came into the third quarter anticipating that sales would actually be a little bit down on a sequential basis, and in fact, they grew by 11%. So it's a very, very strong outperformance. And as we look into the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter traditionally, there can be some seasonal moderation in the industrial market in certain years, together with the fact that we had this very, very strong surge in demand, in particular, related to medical in the second and third quarters. I think it's very natural that there would be a slight easing of that into the fourth quarter. But all that being said, even with this outlook in the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, we would expect to be growing in a pretty strong fashion in the fourth quarter and then our full year outlook still to grow in the low double digits, is a very, very strong outlook for a year where you had a global pandemic, which did have certain impacts on the overall industrial market. And it's a credit to our team to really quickly redeploy our resources on interconnect products, value add interconnect and sensors to those areas of the industrial market where there was indeed strength this year. It's interesting. I look into the third quarter, you know we service, I don't know, it's like a dozen or so different end segments of the industrial market. And I talked about the ones that were up, but we had also some that were down. I mean, you can imagine that a segment like an oil and gas was not very strong here in the third quarter. We had other areas that were also not very strong in the third quarter, but those were more than offset by the really excellent demand that we saw in the segments that I already discussed. So I think it's a very favorable outlook actually for the fourth quarter and for the full year, and we're just really pleased with how our team working in the industrial market has capitalized on the breadth of opportunities, some of which were really unexpected as we came into 2020. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein from Truist Securities. Your line is open. William Stein : Thanks, and thanks for squeezing me in. Adam, I'm hoping, you know we can address the mobile networks and market. We normally think of Amphenol as a company that finds growth even when the end markets aren't exhibiting it. And this is an end market that's gone through some changes in the last couple of years with the roll out of 5G. Last year, there was a pretty big roll out. This year, there was as well, and yet we're seeing last year revenue was flat in this end market, this year we're looking at down double-digits. Is there something that's preventing the company from exhibiting it's sort of normal pattern of finding growth even if it's - even if end markets aren't cooperating either a change in who you can and can't sell to or the change in technology that works against you in some way? Thanks for any update in this area. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Will. Look, I think the easiest explanation and the simplest thing here is, if you look at this year and last year, what has been the biggest change that has impacted and that's when we've talked about it are in fact that there are some customers who we traditionally sold to, who this year we are selling less to and even into the latter part of last year we were selling less to, and this is related to the Department of Commerce restrictions on the certain entities in China that we've talked about. I think that's the biggest story here. Now on an overall basis is capital spending with our operator customers, for example, going up or going down, yes, it remains to be seen for the year, but I think there is one thing which is that as we got into the pandemic, there was a rush to expand bandwidth. And I think in certain respects that rush to expand bandwidth came at the expense of the capacity and coverage that oftentimes is a bigger driver of just the end nodes of the mobile network investment which can drive our mobile networks business. And so, when you look at the growth that we've had in IT datacom, for example, some of that growth is coming ultimately from customers who also manage and build wireless networks in support of the bandwidth of their core networks, because people are working from home, they're studying from home, they're soaking up bandwidth that maybe was not expected, for sure, it was not expected. And so, I think that there is some of that dynamic. But the biggest and probably the most simple explanation to what you've described is, in fact, those Department of Commerce restrictions. And as we head into next year, I think that our team remains very confident in our position with customers around the world. We have strong position on next generation equipment, and we'll see how it goes, and we'll try to give a good assessment of this market as we come into - as we come into 2021. But no doubt, I mean, this has been a little bit more of a challenging market for us here in this year because of those - because of those factors that we've discussed. Operator : Our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Your line is open. David Kelley : Maybe just stepping back from the end market specific discussions. I was curious if you could talk about just broadly what you're seeing as it relates to demand and order patterns in China? Are we fully back of, let's call it, pre-COVID levels across your exposures in the region today? Adam Norwitt : Yes, it's a great question. I would say that our performance in Asia, in general, in China being the largest factor for us in Asia, and for most in Asia, was really outstanding in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. And so, I would say, back to pre-COVID and beyond in terms of the demand levels that we've seen. And I think that's true in the industrial market, I think that's true in the automotive market, I think that's true in the communications markets, all with the caveat related to the question that we will just ask relative to mobile networks and the restricted entities list. But beyond that, I would say that we've seen just great demand, and it is amazing. Craig and I, we have a lot of calls and now we do Zoom calls or Teams or Google Meetings or all of these different video calls with our customers - with our team, and you do that with people in China now and they're all sitting around the conference room together, nobody is wearing masks, because the virus is essentially not there. It is being kind of stopped at the border through a very rigorous approach to quarantining and testing. And so, I think that that has allowed, in particular China, to kind of get back to normal. People are going to movies, people are going to grocery stores, people are buying cars, people are riding on planes and trains, and all of this. And we see that on our computer screens, and I would be lying if I said I didn't have a little bit of jealousy to watch a group of 10 people sitting around the conference room table like we used to be here, but that will come here again. We will get there in other parts of the world as well, but it started earlier in China. We are actually two days from now we'll be exactly nine months since Wuhan was shutdown, how time does fly here in 2020. And we all know how tough that was in China in the first quarter, shutting everything down, every one of our 50 factories, every one of our than 35,000 people stuck at home for three weeks, the rigor with which the reopening happened, and we talked it back in the - at the end of the first quarter and the second quarter, how proud we were of the speed with which our team was able to implement measures to protect people and thereby secure a more rapid reopening of our operations. And I think now, here we are, nine months later, and things are relatively back to normal in China, and that includes the demand environment. And I'm very proud of our team working in China. All of them are local. And that's one thing I just want to emphasize once again. How we participate in every market where we work around the world is with local organizations, people who are from that country to whom we give full authority, we see to them the entrepreneurial authority to make appropriate decisions for their business on a day-to-day basis, that becomes even more critical in a year like this, where we cannot fly in and out of China, we can't go hold people's hands. We have to sort of talk to them on video calls, communicate with them as best that we can, but then have confidence that they are making the right decisions to capitalize on whatever opportunities are there in the market. And here's where the unique structure of Amphenol, I think, has shown its extraordinary agility and strength that in that place where the world has become more normal. We have an extraordinary team of dedicated individuals who can make decisions on the ground to capitalize on success and to deal with challenges. And that is in its essence, one of the key values. And the really the pillars of why Amphenol has been successful for many, many decades. Operator : Our next question - and our last question rather for today is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open. Joe Giordano : Thanks for sneaking me in here. Most of what I want to ask is, I think, over here, but I'm curious, Adam, understanding the nature of your military business and why the shift towards tactical and why you guys are able to kind of grow so fast - so much faster than budgets, how does that though process change or does it not change and how do you think about the sizing of your business potentially out of couple of years in a different administration? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, look, I think the - our strength in military and its root comes from two things. Number one, it comes from the fact that we have the deepest and broadest array of technologies in the industry, there is no doubt about it. I mean, we are the leader in this industry, we have been in this industry for 100 years, us or our predecessor companies, and that strength that we have across all product technologies is so critical. But the second piece of it is our ability to execute. And I talked about that earlier. The fact that last year we were able to execute on a really almost unprecedented increase in demand, 23% sales growth last year that we were able to continue to support our customers even with all of the disruptions that we saw in the second quarter. And as we look at the broader military market, the defense market, I think, you alluded to a shift to tactical. I would actually say a shift from tactical, because I've talked about this for quite a while now that the militaries of the world, and whether that's in our country or in the allies of the U.S. and other countries, there was, for many years, a focus on this kind of whack-a-mole of catching stateless actors. And that was a very tactical move, which didn't require necessarily significant investments in military technology that I think has changed quite significantly, and we've seen that change happening slowly and maybe one could even say that this year that change has even a little bit accelerated where the real concern for militaries, those that we work with has become a much more strategic concern. And at the end of the day, strategic military tension leads to the adoption of technology. You're not dealing with trying to hunt down a terrorist needle in a haystack, rather you're trying to create defense systems, aggressive systems, whatever those may be to do battle with very formidable and known adversaries. And I think in that case, the real asset that the military takes advantage of is technology. And so, look, I'm not going to prognosticate about what elections are going to matter and which countries and how that's going to ultimately directly or indirectly affect military budgets. But what is for sure is that the geopolitical world that we are in today, it's a different one than we were in five years ago and certainly 10 years ago. And it's one that I believe is more reliant disproportionately on the innovations of our military customers and thereby our ability to enable those innovations with next generation technologies. So regardless of what election results come, I actually feel good about the prospects for our business in the military market because of our unique position there. And we'll see, we are reactive, we are agile in that market, and we'll deal with whatever comes our way. But I think the geopolitics of the moment and which have been building actually create a more favorable environment. Very good. Well, Joe, thank you for your last question. And I would like to just take this opportunity to thank everybody for your time and your attention to Amphenol today. And most importantly, since we won't get a chance to talk to most of you until 2021, unbelievably, I do want to wish everybody that you should stay safe and continue to stay vigilant as we come into the fall. We need you all healthy, and I wish you, your family, your friends and your communities, all the best as we come into the fall and winter season. And we look forward to speaking to all of you again in the new year. Thanks so much to everybody. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, speakers. And thank you all for attending today's conference. And have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, Our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The Company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $2.426 billion, and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15 and $1.13, respectively. Sales were up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currencies and organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies and organically. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales, was up 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was down 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year 2020, sales were $8.599 billion, which was up 5% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically compared to 2019. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, which increased from 22.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020. In the cable segment, margins were 10.3%, which increased from 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, adjusted operating income was $1.650 billion, which was slightly up from 2019 and resulted in a full year 2020 adjusted operating margin of 19.2% compared to 20% in 2019. This 80 basis point decline reflects the challenges and results -- resulting impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the first half of the year. Given the unprecedented challenges we saw this year, we are extremely proud of the Company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 21.7%, which compared to 20.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019. For the full year, the Company's GAAP effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% and 20.2%, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate for both the full year 2020 and 2019 was 20.5% -- 24.5%. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 12% to $1.15 in the fourth quarter compared to $1.03 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% to $1.13 in the fourth quarter of 2020 from $0.98 in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $3.91, a 4% increase from 2019 GAAP diluted EPS of $2.75. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.74 for 2020, which was unchanged compared to 2019. This was a strong performance considering the significant challenges and related incremental costs related -- resulting from the pandemic. Orders for the quarter were $2.512 billion, which was up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and up 10% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 to 1. The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. We are proud that operating and free cash flow for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 were all records for the Company. Cash flow from operations was a strong $441 million in the fourth quarter, or 124% of net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $371 million, or 104% of net income. Cash flow from operations for the full year was $1.592 billion, or approximately 132% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2020 was $1.328 billion, or 110% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days, were 79, 72 and 61 days, respectively, all within a normal range. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million under the $2 billion open market stock repurchase plan, bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 million shares or $641 million. Total debt at December 31 was $3.9 billion and net debt at the end of the year was $2.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.2 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion plus the availability under our credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2020 EBITDA was approximately $600 million and $2 billion, respectively. And at December 31, 2020, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times. Lastly, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, which will be effective as of March 4, 2021. I will now turn it back to Adam, who will provide some commentary and current trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much. And I'd like to extend my welcome to everyone here on the phone today and I hope it's not too late to wish everybody a Happy New Year, as we're still here in the month of January. First, I just want to express my hope that all of you on the call here today that you, your family, your friends and colleagues are all staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. I'm going to highlight our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. As Craig mentioned, I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and then, of course, we'll have time at the end for questions. Now, with respect to the fourth quarter and amidst what has, no doubt, been an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we finished 2020 with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above our guidance. Sales grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, reaching a new record $2.426 billion. This organic growth, which was very strong, was driven by growth in mobile devices, industrial and automotive end markets in particular. The Company booked a record of $2.512 billion in orders in the fourth quarter and that's a strong book-to-bill of 1.04 to 1. Despite continuing to face some operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic, adjusted operating margins were strong in the quarter, reaching 20.6%, a 10 basis point increase from third quarter levels and 60 basis points from prior year. Craig already highlighted the operating and free cash flow of the Company, very strong at $441 million and $371 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter. Both just excellent reflections of the quality of the Company's earnings. I just want to say, with this fourth quarter how proud I am of our team around the world. And our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst the environment that still has continued challenges. Our small acquisition team was also very busy in the fourth quarter and here in the last few weeks of January. As we announced on December 9, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire MTS Systems, a leading supplier of advanced test systems, motion simulators and precision sensors, for $58.50 a share. The MTS acquisition continues to be subject to MTS shareholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, as well as customary closing conditions. In addition, last week we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Illinois Tool Works, under which ITW will acquire MTS' Test & Simulation segment following the closing of our acquisition of MTS. The sale is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We continue to expect that both the acquisition of MTS, as well as the follow-on sale of the Test & Simulation business to ITW, will both occur approximately in the middle of 2021. I can just say that we've long been attracted by the outstanding technology and deep entrepreneurial culture of MTS Sensors and look forward to welcoming this wonderful team of people into the Amphenol family. This acquisition, which is highly complementary to our current sensor offering, represents a further broadening of our high technology sensor offering to customers across the automotive, industrial, military and commercial air industries. We expect the addition of MTS Sensors to add approximately $350 million in revenues and to generate approximately $0.10 per share of earnings accretion in the first year post closing. Now here in the last few weeks of January, we're also pleased to have closed two additional acquisitions of outstanding entrepreneurial companies, which we purchased for a combined price of $160 million. First, Positronic is a provider of high reliability harsh environment connectors for customers primarily in the military aerospace, IT datacom and industrial markets. Based in Springfield, Missouri and with also operations in France, India and Singapore, and with annual sales of approximately $80 million, Positronic represents a great addition to our harsh environment product offering. Next El-Cab, which is based in Poland, is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and related interconnect products, primarily serving the industrial market and with annual sales of approximately $55 million. What I'm very pleased by is that both Positronic and El-Cab are private, family-owned companies with rich histories, leading technologies and excellent positions with customers in their target markets. As we welcome the outstanding Positronic and El-Cab teams to the Amphenol family and as we look forward to eventually welcoming the talented MTS Sensors organization in the coming months, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the Company. Now, if we just look back on 2020 and some of the highlights from the year, despite the many challenges we all faced in 2020, from both a personal and a professional standpoint, Amphenol's dedicated entrepreneurial team performed just incredibly well. And I just could not be more proud of our performance this year. Sales reached a record $8.6 billion, growing 5% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and actually surpassed our pre-pandemic outlook that we had given back a year ago. Our full year adjusted operating margins of 19.2%, did decline 80 basis points from prior year, but this decline was due to the significant cost challenges we experienced in the first half of 2020, after which our team was able to return to more typical profit levels in the second half. And that enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted EPS of $3.74, which was the same level as we achieved in 2019. No question, an impressive result given the circumstances. We generated record operating and free cash flow of $1.592 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively. Excellent confirmations of the Company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management, even in these most unprecedented of times. Our acquisition program remains strong, despite the challenges related to the pandemic, with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2020, EXA Thermometrics and Onanon, as well as Positronic and El-Cab here in January and the signing of MTS that we already discussed. These acquisitions expand our position across a broad array of technologies and markets, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're particularly excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the Company's future performance. In addition, in 2020, we bought back over 6 million shares under our buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend to 16%. And as Craig mentioned, we're announcing today, a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company's shares. So, while the overall market environment in 2020 was highly uncertain, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can now drive superior long-term performance. Now, turning to our -- the trends and our progress across our served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the Company's balanced and broad end-market diversification continues to create value for the Company, with no single end-market representing more than 22% of our sales in the year 2020. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets. That was particularly important here in 2020, but while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. The military market represented a 11% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the quarter grew modestly from prior year, increasing by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter, with growth in naval, space and avionics applications offset in part by moderations in ground vehicles, rotorcraft and airframe. Sequentially, our sales increased as we had expected coming into the quarter by 3%. For the full year 2020, our sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production disruptions that we experienced in the first half of 2020. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease modestly from these fourth quarter levels. I just want to say that our organization working in the military market has worked long and hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position, while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all segments of this important market. Our performance in 2020, especially given the many disruptions related to the pandemic, is a great reflection of the results of those efforts. Given the ongoing and favorable military spending environment, our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on the demands of our customers by supporting the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% of our sales for the full year. Not surprisingly, fourth quarter sales were down significantly, reducing by approximately 50%, as the commercial air market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft, due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a little bit better than expected, declining 10% from the third quarter and for the full year 2020, sales declined by 34%, reflecting that significant impact of the pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Look, there is no doubt that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry, which is seriously impacting the market for commercial airplanes. Nevertheless, our team, who has just been so resilient over the course of this year, remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms, as well as next-generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes and we remain well positioned when this market ultimately returns to growth. The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter and in the full year of 2020. Our sales in this market significantly exceeded expectations that we had coming into the quarter, increased by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year. This robust growth was driven, especially by the battery and electric vehicle, instrumentation, heavy equipment, factory automation and medical segments of the industrial market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the third quarter. We're really pleased with our results in industrial for the full year, with sales growing 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we saw strong demand in really those same markets, battery and EV, instrumentation, heavy equipment, also alternative energy and of course, medical, which was a very strong segment in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a slight moderation from the strong fourth quarter sales levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market, whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment or managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital goods and next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers are fully supported regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen during the pandemic. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 17% of our sales for the full year 2020. Sales in this market were also much stronger than we had expected coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically in the fourth quarter, and that was really driven by broad-based growth across all geographies in the automotive market. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 22% as we continue to benefit from the broad recovery in the global automotive market. For the full year 2020, our sales declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 8% organically. And that really reflected the significant challenges in factory shutdowns experienced by the auto industry in the first half of the year related to the pandemic, but was partially offset by our strong recovery that we drove in the second half. Looking into 2021, we do expect a sequential moderation from these high sales levels in the first quarter. Look, no doubt about it, the automotive industry faced one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, during the first half of 2020, in particular in the second quarter, and that was followed by an unexpectedly robust recovery here in the second half. I'm just so proud of our team working in this important market, who has clearly demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, secured the Company's position with our customers across the automotive market. Regardless of this most dynamic of years, we have continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of traditional fuel and electric-powered vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. This consistent strategy will continue to benefit us long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 15% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the quarter to mobile device customers increased by a much stronger-than-expected 32% from prior year, with strength in all product types, but particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 15% and that was driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2020, sales in the mobile devices market increased by a very strong 16%, as we continued to benefit from our agility in reacting to changes in demand in this dynamic market. For the full year, we saw particularly strong sales growth in products incorporated into laptops, tablets, wearables and other accessories as well as production-related products, and that was offset in part by a slight moderation of sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typically significant seasonal sequential decline of approximately 40%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, all positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and 6% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter decreased from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, with declines in sales to both equipment manufacturers as well as operators. Sequentially, our sales did increase by a bit less than we had expected, 12%. For the full year 2020, sales declined by 16% from prior year, which reflected the impact of the U.S. government restrictions on certain Chinese customers that had been imposed in 2019, as well as other impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase from this quarter's levels, as operators expand their investments in next-generation mobile networks. Regardless of the challenging demand environment in the mobile networks market in 2020, we're confident in the Company's long-term position in this important and exciting industry. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next-generation equipment and networks. And as customers ramp up investment of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year of 2020. Sales in the quarter was stronger than expected, rising by 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year, as stronger sales of networking equipment and server-related products were offset by lower sales of storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales declined by 8% from our very robust third quarter. We're very pleased with our performance for the full year for IT datacom, with our sales growing a very strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, as we capitalized on increased demand from our OEM and service provider customers, as they work to accelerate bandwidth capacity expansions, in particular to support home-based work, school and entertainment. Our team working in support of these customers has clearly distinguished themselves this year, reacting quickly to capitalize on unprecedented demand for our industry-leading high-speed and power products. At the same time, we've not slowed down our efforts to further develop that broad range of leading interconnect products in support of data communications networks around the world. Looking into the first quarter of 2021, we expect a typical seasonal moderation of sales here in the quarter. But nevertheless, we remain very encouraged by the Company's strong technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance, in order to manage the dramatic increases in bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Sales increased by 3% in the fourth quarter from prior year, driven by stronger demand for home installation related equipment from our broadband operators. On a sequential basis, sales decreased as expected by 9% from the third quarter. For the full year of 2020, sales were flat and that's despite the significant disruptions to production and demand that we experienced in the first quarter, offset by the accelerated investments in support of bandwidth later in the year. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels and we remain encouraged by the Company's position in the broadband market. With our expanded range of products, together with strong relationships with customers around the world, we look forward to benefiting as operators increase their network investments in the future. Now just to summarize, there is no question that 2020 was one of the most challenging years we've all experienced. But in the face of these challenges, I'm just so proud of the entire team of Amphenolians around the world, who have managed extraordinarily well throughout the pandemic and the related disruptions to the economy. Through our dual-pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program, the Company continues to expand our market position, while strengthening our financial performance. Amphenol's superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers across our diverse end markets, worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, a highly effective acquisition program and I can say, most importantly in this pandemic-impacted 2020, an agile and entrepreneurial management team. Now, turning to our outlook and regardless of our strong performance in the fourth quarter, there still remains significant economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will not be providing full year guidance at this time. Assuming no new material disruptions from the pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.120 billion to $2.180 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $0.94. I would just note that on a post-split basis, this adjusted diluted EPS guidance would be $0.45 to $0.47. This guidance represents sales growth in the first quarter of 14% to 17% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27% to 32%, again compared to the first quarter of 2020. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our position and expand our profitability. Our entire organization remains committed to delivering strong financial results, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly heroic efforts here in the fourth quarter and throughout the entirety of 2020. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will now begin. Please be reminded that questioners are only allowed to ask one question. Our first question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Thank you so much for taking my question. I was hoping to better understand the orders that the Company reported and the strong book-to-bill of 1.04, to what extent do you think those orders are to help sort of true end demand? And do you think any of the orders that the Company is receiving are potentially customers placing longer-dated backlog, because of some of the supply chain challenges that have really impacted semiconductors, but perhaps is impacting orders to electronics companies more broadly, potentially including Amphenol or any other factors that may be influencing the orders other than some of the more typical drivers like increasing content per unit? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Mark. Look, customers place orders to us and we can't always exactly pinpoint what the demand is, except we know that when they tell us they want the product. And I wouldn't tell you that we've seen any dramatic lengthening of lead times or longer-dated orders per se. You mentioned the widely reported discussions around semiconductor availability in a variety of markets. I think our customers are pretty smart. And while they may be chasing lots of semiconductors or trying to put orders on those kind of products, they know that our products are available for them. And we haven't disappointed them throughout this year, even with the disruptions early in the year, even with the significant increases in certain of our markets in the second half. So I wouldn't necessarily say that customers are lumping us into that kind of semiconductor category. I think that customers are looking to us, no question about it, on the basis of the fact that we were there for them when they needed us most. In particular, as many of our customers coming out of the pandemic, had certain -- some parts of their supply chain, which still had a lot of disruptions. And the excellent job that our team did in recovering from those disruptions, whether that was early on in the year, with bringing all of our factories in China back to full production, substantially earlier than many or continuing in through later part of the year with the recoveries that we saw, for example, in automotive and industrial and other markets. So, I think that our team is doing a good job of making sure that we get more than our fair share of our customers' bandwidth and orders, and we're going to keep driving for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on what Mark was talking about and maybe more specifically item on the industrial and automotive kind of the non-tech markets, where growth rates have been extremely strong. I think the concern is starting to become that, are we starting to over-ship versus end-demand and suddenly 20%, 24% organic growth is much better than what the underlying end-demand is. Just on those two segments, I'd love to understand how does one get conviction, how do you get conviction that a strong first half may not result in a bigger correction to half of the year? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, look, it's a fair question, Amit. I think we had just outstanding performance in the fourth quarter in both of those markets, as you know, 29% and 24% organic growth in industrial, 24% and 19%, respectively, in automotive. I think that we are outperforming by any measure, I would say the various markets. But does that mean that they are taking our product and putting it on the shelf? No. I mean, we don't see that whatsoever. But, at the same time, there is still uncertainty in the marketplace. We're not giving guidance for the full year. We have done an outstanding job of supporting our customers when they needed us in the ramp up after the various disruptions. And regardless of what happens in end demand, I believe that our position with customers is stronger than ever. Now, I should also mention that, whether it's in industrial or in automotive and obviously, industrial has a lot of different segments within it, we see continued content gains in both of those areas, which are greater than just the end unit demand. And that's the trend of adoption of electronics into all types of systems, all types of equipment, all types of products. And if anything, we've seen that adoption accelerate over the course of this year for a variety of reasons and much has been reported about the acceleration, for example, of electric drivetrains in cars, where we benefited greatly for that. But we've seen a lot of very similar dynamics across the multiple segments within the industrial market. So, look what does this mean for the second half of 2021, again, we're not giving guidance for the year. There is a lot of uncertainty related to the pandemic, but I think our position with our customers is stronger than ever before. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joe Giordano : Good afternoon. So, there's a lot of debate in auto like longer term about like what applications should be -- that need to be hard wired versus when wireless is most appropriate. I mean, I know your portfolios seems to be intentionally structured to benefit kind of no matter what the answer to that question is, or that trend is. But can you talk about how you think that plays out? What are your customers thinking like, is there like a limitation on what can be wireless? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, without getting into too deep of a technical discussion here, I think you already kind of answered the question as I would answer, which is, we are agnostic. The fact is, we are a significant supplier of interconnect products, antennas and sensors into the automotive market. And to the extent that there is next-generation developments, new architectures in the car that create a kind of an open field to help enable that, that's always been a benefit for Amphenol in the long term. And so I would expect the same that to the extent that things become, how you say, more -- less wired or more wired, more wireless. The fact that we are a manufacturer of interconnect antennas and sensors positions us very well regardless of what that outcome is. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Yes, thank you. Adam, can you just touch on or follow up on the MTS acquisition. I mean, pretty unique in terms of size of a business that you're acquiring here? And also maybe expand on just -- you talked about some of the complementary nature, kind of what it does your portfolio as you go out in time? Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Craig. I mean, look, I think the only thing that I would say is really unique about MTS is the fact that it's a public company. It's our first public company acquisition. But, in terms of scale of the acquisition, you'll recall that we made the acquisition of FCI, I think it's been, what Craig, six years or so since that acquisition and at the time when we were a substantially smaller company. FCI was about a $1.2 billion purchase price, and this is $1.7 billion less the proceeds from the Test & Sim business. So, I wouldn't say that the size is unique. But the process is a little bit more unique with the public company process. And then with the strategic review that we did, that ultimately resulted in an outstanding outcome of us negotiating together with Illinois Tool Works, or ITW, the disposition of the Test & Simulation segment to ITW. And ITW is just an outstanding company. MTS is an outstanding company. And you know how we feel about Amphenol. So, I think this is a three really outstanding companies ending up in a real win-win-win for all parties, whether that's the shareholders of MTS, whether that's Amphenol or whether that is, in fact, ITW. From our position, the MTS Sensors business, which is what ultimately attracted us to MTS, it is just extraordinarily complementary. I mean, I'd say virtually no overlap with our own sensor offering, extremely harsh environment products used in a variety of really high technology applications. These are sensors that are used in force and vibration, pressure, position, really at the highest level of reliability with also complex interconnect systems associated there with. And so, from a -- when we talk about the complementary aspect of the MTS Sensors business, it is really just that unique -- uniquely complementary set of products across the end-markets where we very excited by. And then you add to all of that, just a wonderful, wonderful management team across the business. By the way all of MTS, we've just been so impressed with the people at MTS. But particularly with the MTS Sensors team, we're just so excited by this entrepreneurial organization and it's a team that we've known for a long time. This was not a kind of last minute thing here, far from it. We've known this organization for a very long time and we're very excited, subject to the shareholder approvals, subject to the regulatory and other closing conditions, we're very excited one day to welcome them into the Amphenol family. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Adam, I wanted to use the last question here on MTS as an excuse to ask you about Cable Products. I mean you -- I think you didn't want to be in the Test business and that led to the decision of selling that MTS asset to ITW. I mean, on the same lines, how should I think about the longer-term reasons to be in Cable Products and Solutions, which you report as a separate segment. I can see kind of the margins are quite a bit below your other segments and we haven't seen like strong growth for a while here. So, what's the longer term opportunity you -- how does it fit in with the rest of the business or do you see it as a core part of your portfolio overall? Adam Norwitt : Yes, I mean, the simple answer to -- you said it at the end, do we see it as a core part of our portfolio? For sure. And it's very different than the situation with MTS. In the case of MTS, we were drawn to MTS because of the sensor business. We were impressed, by the way, very impressed with the team and with the business of Test & Simulation, but it's a different business for us, really categorically different and that was why we talked about having a strategic review. And in the end, I think a great outcome for all parties with the agreed sale to ITW. In the case of our Cable Products, Cable Products are an integral part of an interconnect system that is used in particular for getting high-speed bandwidth to customers and to companies. And what we've said all along is, yes, the Cable Products segment may underperform from an operating margin perspective for the moment, we don't want to be in the business of picking the winners and losers of how people and companies are going to get Internet connectivity to their homes, to their businesses, to the universities, to the governments. We want to be betting really on every possible way of doing that. And thus, our position with the cable operators, with the MSOs, is a very important strategic position for Amphenol. And that importance, by the way, carries over into our interconnect segment, where the strength that we have, the reputation that we have, our ability to service these service providers as opposed to OEMs, has been a fabulous value to the rest of the Company, in particular, as we've seen other markets move more towards the service provider market. And let me just give you an example of that. You take the IT datacom market, which traditionally we were selling products that go just directly to equipment manufacturers. Well, as I think everybody on the call knows, over the recent five or more years, maybe even a little bit more than half a decade, we've seen increasing strength and increasing demand from web service providers. How you work with a service provider is very, very different than how you work with an OEM, who ultimately is making a piece of equipment in a factory. And our experience in the Cable Products has been invaluable to our team in making sure that we can react to the demand and the volatility of the demand that is really endemic in any service provider business. When I look at our results this year, in particular in IT datacom, where we did see extremely strong demand from service providers, our ability to react on a moment's notice, the mindset of that is a mindset that we developed, that we incubated originally in our Cable business. And I think that that's just a great reflection of the broad value that we see in that business, beyond just the fact that it does have today a little bit lower margins, to much smaller piece of our business that it once was, but it's still an important part of Amphenol's strategy. Operator : Thank you. Up next for question is Nick Todorov from Longbow Research. Nick Todorov : Yes, thanks. Hi, Adam. Hi team. I want to touch upon the outlook on the mobile devices. Adam, I think you mentioned seasonal about down 40%. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color, because as we are looking at the data points, smartphone sales are strong, PC sales remain strong, as well as all the consumer electronics. So, maybe you can talk, what are you seeing that the first quarter is going to be more seasonal than anything else? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Nick. I think this is not an abnormal guidance that we see. Look, we had very, very strong performance in mobile devices this year. We came into the year with an expectation of the market being flat. I will tell you, I mean, we didn't give guidance at the time, but had you asked me at the end of Q1, what would mobile devices be for the year? I probably would have thought it would be even down given the disruptions that we saw in the first quarter to our China facilities. And the vast majority, if not all, of our mobile device production is really in China and all of those factories were shut down, as you know, for the better part of three weeks, due to the early stage of the coronavirus. And then our team just did an unbelievable job of reacting to the strength in the market. And the strength this year, well, there was, on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter, strength in smartphones, where we really saw a lot of strength this year, was maybe not surprisingly in devices that are needed by people when they are working, when they're learning, when they're being entertained at home. So, things like laptops; things like tablets; we saw a lot of strength in wearables, I know, a lot of people got on health kicks and maybe these wearables can be very useful there; a lot of strength in things that go in your ears, hearable devices as we call them, and probably because you have a lot of people doing work and school from home and they might have other people in the same house and they want to have some privacy. Whatever the reason is, there was just a great amount of strength and our team was able to react to quite unexpected demand. And so, as you go into the first quarter, I think that we would expect normally some relaxation of that demand. I mean, look, anecdotally, I tried to buy Christmas presents for my wife and my daughter of a computer, because they both have really old computers and I totally failed as a father and a husband and they each got their present, one got it about a month late, and the other one still hasn't gotten hers. So, there was a real demand back in the fourth quarter, in particular for these devices. And I think we wouldn't expect such a continuation here in the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Up next for questions would be Luke Junk from Baird. Luke Junk : Good afternoon, everyone. My question, I was wondering about the Company's ability to, I guess, you could say, cross-pollinate between the industrial as it relates to batteries and electric vehicles and your core auto business. I guess, I'm wondering, does that sort of the two-pronged approach open additional doors for Amphenol? Adam Norwitt : Yes, actually Luke, it's a great question. The simple answer is, yes. Our team work in industrial, our team work in automotive and there's a lot of crossover, by the way, in those teams. There is an enormous amount of interaction from a technology, from a customer perspective, to ensure that we're maximizing our position with customers, whether they are making an electric bus or an electric sports car. And so, that interaction, as you call it cross-pollination, we call it inside Amphenol collaboration, is something that we're doing all the time. And that's collaboration from a product development, making sure that we're bringing a full suite of products to customers, in each of those markets and really capitalizing on that trend of electrification that we're seeing, again not just in automotive, but we're seeing that trend very significantly in the industrial market as well. And I'd say that when you look at our performance in both of those end markets, which we talked about with one of the earlier questions, it's not totally coincident that we're seeing those strong content growth in both of those markets, some of which is being driven by this trend of electrification. Operator : Thank you. Next for our question is Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes, thank you. Adam, if we step back a couple of years over here, the Company was operating north of 20% operating margins. You're slightly below that, embedded in your guidance over here, on slightly higher revenues versus 1Q '19. Clearly, these are unprecedented times. There's been a lot of cost inefficiencies that have crept in because of COVID. Can you maybe characterize if that is the reason why the margins are where they are? I mean, clearly, very strong in the face of what has actually transpired, but still below a couple of years ago. And I'm wondering if, a, you could help us think through what the reasons are, if it is truly COVID inefficiencies and if it is, how large are these and how long do you expect them to persist, after which we should start to see sort of back to historical levels of margin? Adam Norwitt : Wamsi, thanks for the question. Yes, I think if you look back the first quarter of 2019, we were certainly operating at very strong profitability at that point. Honestly and we finished the fourth quarter at very strong profitability levels. So I guess I wouldn't necessarily just kind of look back into '19 to kind of just to see a time where we are operating at strong profitability levels. If you look at the fourth quarter, we already reached 20.6% here in the quarter. We certainly still see some disruption related to the pandemic and that's certainly embedded in those numbers, maybe slightly offset by some other benefits we have and things like T&E. So I think I said last quarter that we kind of see a relatively neutral impact in the second half of the year. As we kind of go into the first quarter, our guidance really reflects, I would say, a sequential seasonal decline and we talked about approximately 10% kind of seasonal decline in sale. And that does, as you mentioned, kind of imply a conversion rate may be slightly higher than our normal 30% downside, which would maybe get to the profitability level in the 19% -- kind of a little above 19% range. So I think that's probably the basis of your question. I mean, I wouldn't say this conversion is isn't -- certainly isn't so significant, given the level of sequential decline we are seeing kind of going into the first quarter. In addition, combined with a continued challenging kind of cost environment, we are seeing still COVID-related inefficiencies. And I think that the Company has really done a great job thus far, as you saw in 2020, of dealing with those inefficiencies and really snapping back in a profitability level, but we are seeing a little bit of a decline going into the first quarter from a sales perspective, which is going to have some impact. And I think the team has done a great job dealing with that and we'll continue to deal with that. And so, I'm real proud of kind of where we ended up in 2020 and -- and I have no doubt that we'll get back to those levels. The other thing that's happening in the first quarter, certainly, is the acquisitions we just closed on here in January, are having some small effect on the conversion, if you look sequentially into the first quarter. And the ones we did in 2019 certainly wouldn't -- haven't made necessarily the progress that maybe we would have expected in 2020 for very understandable reasons, I think, we're dealing with the pandemic during 2020. So I think there's a few reasons. But, all in all, we're real happy with where we are at profitability, certainly in the second half year of 2020, and be quite honest, even in the first half given the challenges we had. And certainly, we are really confident that as we go into 2021, you'll see those levels snap back to normal levels once COVID is behind us. Operator : Thank you. Up next for questions would be David Williams from Loop Capital. David Williams : Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for letting me ask a question. But just wanted to touch a little bit on the automotive market may be and what your outlook is there? I know you're not providing full year guidance but if you're kind of thinking about the automotive market in terms of the total growth this year and then maybe the mix of EV versus the traditional vehicles, what are your thoughts around that perhaps? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, you said it David, we're not giving an outlook for the year. And I couldn't actually quote for you exactly how much of our business is related to EV versus traditional. I don't have the numbers close at hand. But what I can tell you is that, we are seeing higher growth from EV applications over the last several years and so EVs definitely represent a higher proportion today than they did a year ago, two years ago and three years ago, and we would expect in the coming year or two for that trend to continue. EVs not only do they tend to have potentially a little more content, but the nature of the content can be more attractive and more interesting for a company because of the high reliability, the harsh environment, the high power aspects of those vehicles. So, look, we'll see how the year progresses. We're not giving again guidance, but we have seen good strength in EV, and we would expect to see that going forward. Operator : Thank you. Up next for question would be Chris Snyder from UBS. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I have a follow-up on auto. Can you talk a bit about the EV verse ICE competitive environment? Are you seeing new entrants, just given the different product mix and high voltage focus? And conversely, does the shift carry any implications from maybe some of the smaller competitors, who could struggle to invest in EV solutions, at least in the early days? And I just asked, because of the Company's outperformance on the auto side has been very strong in the last couple of quarters. I just wanted to see if there are any share shifts going on? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, look, I don't know specific share shifts. What I do know is we're outperforming the market. And so just I guess, by definition, we're taking some share. And part of the reason for that is EVs and part of the reason is other applications. Are there different competitors in an EV versus an internal combustion engine? There may be. I mean, there's different competitors for all different systems in the car. You have to remember in our industry, there is not a monolithic competitive landscape. There are obviously some companies that are publicly traded and well-known, which are excellent companies, but there is a whole diaspora of competition in the interconnect industry. And each application may have a different landscape of competitors than the application before it. So I guess, by definition, yes, you're going to have some different competitors. I think our strength in EV in part stretches back to the fact that we've been making high-power, high-voltage connectors for really the entire history of Amphenol. That is a legacy, you would call it even a birthright of Amphenol with our military, our industrial business and our ability to collaboratively share some of those underlying core technologies across our team, a little bit like we discussed just a few moments ago, has really positioned the Company well to be an enabler of those next-generation systems, which are really mission critical. So I think we're very happy to have a whole diaspora of competition across all our markets and that includes within automotive. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Thanks, good afternoon. Adam, I was wondering if you could just dig into the weeds on the two acquisitions you just closed in January. You've mentioned one was around harsh environments and we know you're already a leader in that area, and then the other one was tied to cable assemblies and we know you have a pretty broad offering there. So, can you just sort of get into what attracted you to the businesses from a product standpoint? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks so much, Steve. Look, these are both outstanding companies. We've known them both for a long time. I mean the family who founded and still until we just closed recently, Positronic, I've known that family for, I don't know, a decade and a half. I mean it's an outstanding company, Positronics. Just a real marquee brand in the interconnect industry, known for harsh environment, in particular, board level power connectors and some data connectors. These are IO connectors, these go on the board. They are used in a wide variety of systems in the military, as well as in datacom for power and industrial applications, and it's very complementary actually. A lot of the products that they have, Positronics, they have just a real proprietary position across their customer base, and sometimes, you look in admiration at the strength of a company's position, because of the uniqueness of their technology and that's something that we have done for many years with Positronics. El-Cab is a little bit of a different story. El-Cab, first of all, is our first company that's really fully based in Poland. Poland is an outstanding location for low-cost manufacturing with proximity to all of Europe and they have an excellent position in cable assemblies for industrial applications, and in particular, next-generation electric-powered industrial vehicles and whether that's buses, whether that's trucks, delivery vehicles, they're also involved in marine-related cable assemblies. But what really attracted us to them is their just leading position in this sort of EV revolution, industrial EV revolution, and that's something we've done a great job of in Asia, we've done a great job of it in North America and we've done a really -- a good job in Europe. But this accelerates our position in those -- in that electrification of industrial vehicles in Europe. And again, a fabulous team, family-owned company, great management, great products, great position, those are the factors that we always look for in acquisitions. And I think both Positronics and El-Cab deliver wholeheartedly in all those areas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thank you very much. Adam, you mentioned battery factories a couple of times and they are likely into be trillions of dollars of CapEx spent to build terawatts of capacity, not only for electric vehicles, but storage and other uses. So it's probably one of the faster growing market opportunities out there. Is there anything you could tell us about Amphenol's opportunity and positioning in the market? And are there some regional differences? Because I think a lot of the capacity right now is in Asia, but there probably needs to be factories built all over the globe? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think, maybe, it might have contemplated a little bit, Joe. I think what I talked about was battery and EV and factory automation, but not necessarily together. But the fact is, you raised a very good point, which is for sure, whenever you have a massive build out of factories, be that for batteries where there is a lot of automation, next-generation vehicles, whatever and we've seen a lot of build-out of factories, by the way, semiconductor factories as well, you've seen the strength that we've had in instrumentation. Our position in factory automation and instrumentation, test equipment and otherwise, interconnect for all of those, puts us in a very strong position to benefit from the expansion of these facilities. But when we talk about our sales of industrial products into battery applications, it's really actual interconnect sensors that get integrated into these high-technology high-voltage battery systems, both to allow the signal of the battery, the power to come in and out of the battery, and also the control systems for these batteries, which is a wonderful opportunity where there is a lot of kind of interconnect and sensor applications where you're selling to customers just a complete solution to allow them to manage these batteries and thereby get more efficiency and safety out of them, once they're integrated into vehicles. Operator : Thank you. Up next for questions would be William Stein from Truist Securities. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. There's always been quite a focus on the trend to EV. But when we think about U.S. federal energy policy, it looks like there is perhaps a shift in the works to favor more renewables versus carbon-based. And I wonder, Adam, if you can sensitize us to the potential impact of your business. Are renewables a good market for Amphenol relative to downhole, which I understand is very harsh and typically high margin, high ASP sorts of connectors? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean look, we're agnostic Will, to whatever that may be, if it's traditional oil and gas versus renewables versus all that's related to renewables, the battery storage that Joe just asked about and otherwise, we're really agnostic. I mean, if you look as an example, last quarter, we had last quarter a strong growth in alternative energy. And that was offset by relatively strong decline in oil and gas. And I think that's a good indication of the value and the strength of the diversified position that we have really across all areas of whether that be power generation, power consumption, power storage, we've made sure to not place a bet on kind of one trend or another, but rather to be present supporting customers across the board and we are still supporting our oil and gas customers for sure. I mean, that's an important market and I don't think the world is totally detaching from fossil fuels. But if the trend is away from them, we're well positioned either way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Adam and Craig, you've seen a lot of success with your Company in automotive. It used to be about 5% of the Company, now it's 20% of the Company. Is most of that success coming from like the infotainment in the cabin, the safety along the bumper or the batteries in it or the electronic motors? I'm just trying to see, because there are some big trends that are going on. I'm trying to see, where has been the most part of your strength in automotive? Adam Norwitt : Jim, thank you very much. I think you listed a lot of them. I mean the fact is, if I look over the long term and you've followed us for a very long time and so you have a great sense of the arc of the progress of our automotive business over these many years. We started out in automotive many, many years ago as the innovator of airbag connectors and that was kind of our first thing we did and we're talking a long time ago. I think the first airbag was like in 1990 or something like that. So, we're talking a 30-year time period. And over time, we developed into interconnect products for satellite radio and GPS and other infotainment. We built through acquisitions and other -- and organic means presence in emissions control and engine control, other electronics and essentially as the car adopted new electronic systems, we were positioning ourselves either organically or through acquisition, to participate in those next-generation systems. Our growth in automotive was never a question of, kind of, taking someone else's business, that was a legacy business. Rather, it was positioning ourselves, as these new systems were developed, to be there for customers for Tier 1s, for Tier 2s, whomever. And I think that's been very successful over all these years. We believe there is still a lot more potential left in our automotive business. The growth in content in the car is really outstanding and we're not the only one to talk about that. In many ways, to me, a car is becoming kind of a datacenter on wheels. It's becoming an electric powertrain on wheels. I mean, you name it. And each of those new systems, many of which you mentioned, are contributors to the growth of the Company. But I -- what I wouldn't say is, if any of them are disproportionate to our long-term success in that market. I think, it's been actually a relatively balanced contribution to that long-term success, that in particular we've seen over really the last decade. Operator : Thank you. And next question on queue would be from David Kelley from Jefferies. David Kelley : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Just wanted to ask about the industrial trajectory. You discussed and highlighted several secular opportunities. It feels like, from a broad cyclical standpoint, industrial equipment seems to be ramping back up. But we're also going to be coping against some difficult medical comps through the year. So, can you just talk about what you're seeing or what you do see as the biggest drivers for industrials in 2021? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean look, again, we're not giving guidance for 2021. But, when I look at the breadth of our performance here at the end of the year, as we closed out the year, and also throughout the course of the year, it's just there is no single story to the strength. I mean, yes, great performance in battery EV, great performance in instrumentation, great performance in medical. Again, I could give you a long list of the positive contributors to our industrial market. Will there be some areas where there will be a little bit of a tougher comparison? Obviously, the second quarter was a particularly acute quarter for medical, where our team, I mean I just cannot emphasize enough how proud we were to be a contributor to the fight against COVID through our reactivity to the demand for new medical equipment, whether that be respiratory therapy devices and the sensors interconnect products that are contained therein, whether that be hospital equipment to outfit ICUs and other patient care devices. I mean, that is something that we at Amphenol will forever be proud of, the contributions that our team made to the fight against COVID to protect lives and to enable countries around the world to have a fighting chance against this virus. And so, yes, will there be a little bit less maybe of some of those more acute care things? There could be, but who knows. There was also, as many have talked about, reductions in elective procedures, which actually reduced demand for certain medical equipment in some areas too, and so maybe that has the chance to come back. I think there is not the visibility today and thus, why we are not giving the guidance for the year. For me to say, which of those segments, as we go through the course of the year, are going to have the stronger or the weaker performance. But for sure, we have positioned ourselves with our customers by being there for them when they needed us most in their -- in really the most critical of time periods, such that, to the extent that they have business to give, I would expect that they will give at least, if not more than, our fair share to Amphenol. Operator : Thank you. As of this time, we don't have any further questions on queue. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lampo for his closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, this will be Mr. Norwitt for one last remark here. And listen, thank you all for all of your great interest in the Company. We really appreciate everybody's support through this 2020. We know this was not an easy year for all of you, working from home and cooked up and not being able to come visit us, for example. And we for sure, Craig and I, the two of us, no doubt about it, look forward to the day where we get to meet you in person again, host you here in our modest headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut, where we are today. And we look forward to great success and wish you all good health as we continue into 2021. Thank you so much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2021 conference call, and our first quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced 2-for-1 stock split effective on March 4, 2021, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a post-split basis.  The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.377 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.53 and $0.52, respectively. Sales were up 28% in U.S. dollars, 25% local currencies and 23% organically compared to the first quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 3% in local currencies and 4% organically. Orders for the quarter were $2.734 billion, which was up 27% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.15:1.  Breaking down sales into our 2 segments. The interconnect business, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year. Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of last year's.  Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $465 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating margin of 19.6% was down 100 basis points sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating margin and up a strong 260 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, combined with the benefit of a lower cost impact resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment.  The sequential decline in operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the reduced sales levels as well as a more challenging commodity and supply chain environment. From a segment standpoint, the interconnect segment -- in the interconnect segment, margins were 21.5% in the first quarter of 2021, which increased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased 100 basis points sequentially.  In the cable segment, margins were 8.8%, which increased from 7.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and decreased from 10.3% in the fourth quarter. Given the continuing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented culture, which has enabled us to capitalize on the many opportunities for incremental sales, while driving strong operating performance in this very dynamic market environment.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.9%, which compared to 15.9% in the first quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2020. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS increased by 33% to $0.53 compared to $0.40 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 49% to $0.52 from 35% -- $0.35 in the first quarter of 2020.  The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $321 million in the first quarter or 97% of GAAP net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $243 million or 74% of net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 73 and 59 days, respectively, all within their normal ranges. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for approximately $153 million. And during the month of April, the company repurchased a small amount of remaining stock authorized under our existing stock repurchase plan. As a result and as mentioned in today's earnings release, yesterday, the company's Board of Directors approved a new 3-year open market stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to $2 billion of the company's common stock.  At March 31, cash and short-term investments were $2.4 billion, of which $963 million was held in the U.S., with the remainder held outside of the U.S. The elevated level of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was driven by borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program in anticipation of the MTS closing in early April. Total debt was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total available liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, which included total cash and short-term investments on hand. First quarter 2021 EBITDA was $559 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.0x.  Following the close of the quarter, on April 7, we completed the acquisition of MTS, which Adam will discuss in more detail in a moment. The MTS acquisition was funded by a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand as well as additional borrowings under the company's U.S. commercial paper program. On a pro forma basis, including the MTS acquisition and the anticipated divestiture of the test and simulation business, total available liquidity and net leverage at March 31, 2020 would be $3.2 billion and 1.4x, respectively. Until the divestiture of the MTS test and simulation business has closed, we will account for and report the test and simulation business as a discontinued operation.  As such, the expected sales and earnings of the test and simulation business are not included in our guidance. Our guidance also excludes cash and noncash expenses that will be expensed in the second quarter related to the MTS acquisition. These expenses, which we expect to total approximately $85 million or $0.12 per share, include costs related to the early extinguishment of debt, noncash purchase accounting-related expenses, external transaction expenses, severance and other costs. In conjunction with the divestiture of the test and simulation business, the company will also incur certain additional cash tax-related and other acquisition-related costs, which will not be included in income from continuing operations.  Our guidance does incorporate the expected results of the MTS Sensors business, which as previously announced, is expected to generate $350 million in sales and $0.05 in diluted EPS in the first 12 months after closing.  I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends as well as our recently completed acquisitions. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to everybody on the call here today. And I certainly hope that you, your family, your friends and all of your colleagues are continuing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified served markets. And then finally, I'll make a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A at the end.  Our results in the first quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 25% in local currencies. And on an organic basis, sales increased by 23%. And we had organic growth in nearly all of our end markets and driven particularly by growth in the automotive, mobile devices, industrial and IT datacom markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets in a few moments.  Craig mentioned, we booked record orders in the quarter of $2.734 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.15:1. Despite continuing to face a range of operational challenges related to the ongoing pandemic as well as increased costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures, our operating margins were very healthy in the quarter, reaching 19.6%, which was a 260 basis point increase from last year's levels.  Craig mentioned our adjusted diluted EPS grew a very robust 49% from prior year, which is again an excellent reflection of the Amphenol organization's strong execution. We generated operating and free cash flow of $321 million and $243 million in the first quarter, respectively, both clear reflections of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just want to say how proud I am of our team this quarter. And our results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the very dynamic and challenging environment.  And I'd like to make a few comments on our acquisitions in the quarter. As you can tell, our small acquisition team here in Wallingford was very busy in the first quarter, closing 3 additional acquisitions since our last earnings release and bringing our total number of acquisitions closed this year to 5. First, as we announced on April 7, we were very pleased to close on the acquisition of MTS Systems earlier than originally anticipated.  Also, as previously announced, we had signed an agreement to sell the MTS test and simulation business to Illinois Tool Works for a sale price of $750 million. And that is -- that remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments and excludes transaction-related expenses. We expect this sale to close following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.  We're really excited to welcome the talented MTS Sensors team to the Amphenol family. We especially look forward to the strength of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary sensor product portfolios, which, we believe, will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across multiple end markets.  We expect the MTS Sensors business to add approximately $350 million of sales and $0.05 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first 12 months after closing. More importantly, though, we look forward to realizing the long-term benefits of the opportunities created by the collective strengths of Amphenol and MTS Sensors for many years to come. We're truly excited about this significant acquisition, which ultimately has positioned Amphenol as one of the broadest and most diversified sensor companies in the industry.  In addition to the MTS acquisition, we also closed on 2 other small acquisitions during the first quarter. In February, we acquired Euromicron, a manufacturer of highly engineered fiber optic interconnect solutions for the mobile networks and IT datacom markets. Based in Germany, with annual sales of approximately $25 million, Euromicron represents a great addition to our interconnect product offering for customers across the European communications market.  And then in March, we completed the acquisition of Cabelcon from Corning Inc. Cabelcon, which also has sales of approximately $25 million, is a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of high-technology connectors and interconnect assemblies, primarily for customers in the European broadband market. As we welcome these outstanding companies to the Amphenol family, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company.  Now turning to our trends across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create great value. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. This diversification has become ever more valuable given the many market dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now turning first to the military market. The military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as we had expected coming into the quarter, sales grew by 3% from prior year and were essentially flat organically with growth in naval, unmanned aerial vehicles, communications and vehicle ground systems, offset by declines or flat performance in other applications. Sequentially, our sales were modestly down by about 3%.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits from these first quarter levels as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors together with the increased demand for interconnect products. We're especially excited by the addition of the sensors products of MTS to our military product offering. Together with our already leading interconnect products as well as our broad exposure across virtually all defense programs, we look forward to supporting the continued adoption of next-generation electronics into a wide array of military hardware.  The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. And not surprisingly, and as expected, sales were down significantly, declining by 47% from prior year as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the ongoing pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, moderating by just 3% from the fourth quarter. And looking into the second quarter, we do expect a sequential improvement in sales as we benefit from our recently completed acquisitions. Regardless of the ongoing challenging environment in commercial air, our team working in this market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes.  The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in industrial in the first quarter were better than expected, growing a very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 33% organically. This was driven by robust growth in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, instrumentation, factory automation, alternative energy and medical, really a broad performance across many of the segments. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 6% versus the fourth quarter.  Looking into the second quarter, we expect the industrial market to once again grow in the low teens versus the first quarter. And as we benefit from the addition of MTS Sensors, while continuing to gain momentum in many segments of the industrial market. The acquisition of MTS Sensors has expanded our range of sensors sold into the industrial market, adding position, vibration, force and shock sensors that are used in a wide array of industrial applications. Together with our existing sensor operations, we now have a diversified range of sensors supporting virtually all of the segments of the industrial market that we serve. I remain truly proud of our team working across the industrial market around the world. Our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering positions us strongly with customers who are accelerating their adoption of electronics, no matter the application. The automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in this market were also much stronger than we expected, growing 52% in U.S. dollars and 44% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we saw very strong growth of our products that are used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles in the quarter. A great confirmation of our global team's long-term efforts at designing in high-voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next-generation platforms. Sequentially, our sales increased by 6% from the fourth quarter.  Now as has been widely reported, there are a variety of supply chain challenges facing the automotive industry. Accordingly, as we look towards the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales as the global supply chain disruptions temporarily impact certain pockets of new vehicle production. I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They have really demonstrated their agility and resiliency through these most turbulent times and thereby, have secured the company's position with our customers across the automotive market. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future.  The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased by a better-than-expected 51% from prior year, with strength across all product types, including particularly in wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales declined by 35%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter and is within the typical range of first quarter seasonality that we have seen traditionally in the mobile devices market.  Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate a further high single-digit sequential sales decline, which is also not atypical for this market in the second quarter. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and uniquely agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term.  Now turning to the mobile networks market. This market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did grow from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically, as strength from products sold to OEMs was offset in part by a moderation of our sales to network operators. We were encouraged, though, to realize a better-than-expected sequential growth of 19% in the mobile networks market in the quarter as mobile network operators increased their spending on next-generation networks.  Looking to the second quarter, we do expect a modest increase in sales from these first quarter levels, helped by the addition of Euromicron, which expands our offering for mobile networks operators in Europe and positions us well to support future network upgrades. Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our position in next-generation equipment and systems around the world. And as our customers ramp up the investment of these advanced networks, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both original equipment manufacturers as well as mobile network service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected, rising 25% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically from prior year, really on broad-based strength across networking, storage and server applications. While we had expect sales to decline coming out of the fourth quarter, we were pleased to realize actually a sequential growth of 6% as customers continue to increase their demand for our high-technology products, use service providers and in data centers around the world. Looking to the second quarter, we expect a further increase of sales in the mid-single digits from these levels as customer demand continues to accelerate.  We remain very encouraged by the company's outstanding technology position in the global IT datacom market. Our customers around the world, no doubt about it, are continuing to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT datacom with our unique, high-speed, power and other interconnect products. Finally, the broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very strong 16% from prior year as broadband spending levels remained elevated. On a sequential basis, sales grew slightly from the fourth quarter. We do expect a high-teens sequential sales increase in the second quarter as customers continue to upgrade the capacity of their networks to support the significant increase in demand for bandwidth and as we benefit from our recent acquisitions, including Cabelcon. The addition of Cabelcon expands our offering for broadband customers in the European market, which enables us to provide a more diversified range of products for their next-generation networks and the related upgrades.  We look forward to continuing to offer this expanded product offering to broadband service operators around the world, all of whom are working to increase bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses.  Now turning to our outlook, and given the current still dynamic market environment as well as assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.475 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.55. This would represent strong sales growth of 22% to 25% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 33% to 38% compared to the second quarter of last year. And I would just note that the second quarter of last year, as you will recall, was already a strong recovery quarter for the company coming out of the first quarter.  I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the ongoing challenges that are in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. The entire Amphenol organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd like to just take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take whatever questions there may be. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Now our first question is from Chris Snyder of UBS. Christopher Snyder : I guess my question is on supply chain. If you look across the end markets, just given the really -- or the stronger-than-expected growth, did you see any inventory building across any of the end markets? And then kind of staying on that supply chain, as we look into Q2, the top line guidance seems a bit light relative to the Q1 orders and the 1.15 book-to-bill. I mean is there an implication here that deliveries may be pushed out to the right a little bit, just given all the supply chain disruptions we're seeing? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Chris. I mean first, relative to supply chain and our robust results in the first quarter, I mean I would tell you that across the board, customers want our product because their end customers, by and large, also need the product. Whether that's delivering IT datacom connectors that go into web service providers to satisfy the demand for bandwidth that is happening, whether it's automotive customers scrambling to build as many cars as they can, given the low inventory -- low dealer inventories that are out there, we really saw customers taking product and converting that product into their end systems. And we don't -- obviously don't get full visibility into the warehouses of our customers, but we do get some visibility into the distribution channel. And there, we did not see any material increases in inventory or any noticeable inventory builds. I mean actually, to the contrary, our growth in distribution, our book-to-bill in distribution was not meaningfully higher than what we saw across the total company.  Relative to the second quarter, look, we think there's a very strong guidance from several perspectives. First and foremost, there are these supply chain challenges. And I think some of these have been widely reported, in particular, in places like the automotive market, where I talked about that we do see the automotive market having a slight downtick in demand in the second quarter as certain customers have had to take factories offline or otherwise curtail production because of supply chain challenges. So there's no doubt that we see that.  As well, when you look at, on a year-over-year basis, our second quarter guidance, as I mentioned just a few moments ago, this is a very strong guidance, 25% growth at the high end of guidance. And that's on top of a second quarter last year where we had grown already 7% sequentially from the first quarter. You'll also remember that in our mobile devices business, we had a very strong comeback last year in the second quarter. And so that 25% comparison, when seen in the context of last year, I think, is a very, very robust demand.  In terms of the orders, yes, these are very strong orders that we received in the quarter. And could there be some customers who are maybe opening up the aperture of their order scheduling, ordering a little bit longer out? There could be some of that. I think we have some customers, there are many across the supply chain who are a little skittish because of some of the challenges that are so widely reported and that I'm sure all of you know even better than I do, and that can cause some customers to maybe order a little bit more in advance, not to build inventory per se, but to get it on the books.  But look, all that being said, if you look at our orders on a year-over-year basis, they also grew at a similar rate to what our sales grew, about 27%, I think, was the order growth. And I think they're reflective of strong demand on our products from our customers, who we have consistently supported through all cycles of this crisis. And when you look at our performance across each of the individual markets, it's clear that customers are coming back to us because we were there for them when they needed us the most. Operator : Now our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, I was wondering if we could just step back perhaps, given your really broad diversified portfolio. How should investors think about the areas in which Amphenol can benefit from this proposed infrastructure plan? Adam Norwitt : Well, Wamsi, it's a great question. And it's still a proposed infrastructure plan, obviously. So I take everything with a grain of salt, in particular, with the political system that we have now in the U.S. But look, I think we have a lot of our businesses that do stand to play a role in upgrading the infrastructure of the U.S., especially because infrastructure is being defined, as I would think it should be, in a very broad sense.  It's not just roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and airports, which would stimulate demand for a wide variety of products that we sell into heavy equipment and otherwise. But infrastructure means the domestic capacity to produce electronic components in certain cases. Infrastructure means bandwidth. Infrastructure means access to data, access to devices. And I think that all of these things ultimately today have a common thread, and that is that the adoption of electronics and, in turn, our ability to enable that adoption of electronics, plays a significant role in the upgrade of those various \"elements\" of infrastructure.  And so whatever the -- ends up coming out of kind of the sausage factory at Washington, if you will, there's no question to me that electronics is going to play a significant role in helping this country to upgrade its infrastructure in the broadest sense. And I think we're very well positioned across our end markets to play some constructive role in that. Operator : Now our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess my question is really around, Adam, when I look at your growth rates for the first half of this year, they're about 25% or so. Much of this, I assume, is a cyclical market recovery. But I'm wondering if you could actually talk about if Amphenol is seeing share gains pick up as well in the first half of the year, especially as I imagine that your peers have not been able to ramp up capacity as quickly as demand has come back. And if that's true going forward, could that enable you to grow at a larger premium to the underlying industry growth rate and share gains become bigger for you, hopefully? Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Amit, and greetings to you as well. Look, I think the numbers here a little bit speak for themselves. When you look at our overall growth, growing 28% or 23% organically in the quarter, or when you look at some of the individual markets where we had significant growth in a number of our markets, clearly outpacing whatever the industry growth rate will be. And I'm not an expert in exactly what various industry growth rates are. But clearly, growing in industrial by 33% organically and automotive by 44% organically and mobile devices by 51% organically and IT datacom by 25%. Those are clearly ahead of the overall industry growth rates. And you're correct. I think there is a meaningful component of that growth, which is our ability to react quickly, despite a very challenging environment. It should not be understated. There still remains many challenges today in the world, both with COVID and with the supply chain. But our ability to react quickly in an entrepreneurial and agile fashion to satisfy the demand of customers when they need it has been, I think, through this whole cycle, an extraordinary advantage that we brought to bear. And as customers think for the long term about with whom do they want to partner, it's going to be very hard to forget who was there for you when the chips were down at the greatest moment. Who was there for you during the depths of the pandemic when bandwidth was at such a premium and factories were closing all over place because of shutdown orders and the spread of the virus, and who was there to react when you needed to help you support your end customers. And I think that is something that our customers reflect on, integrate into their buying behavior, incorporate into their decisions about who should be their partner going forward.  And so does that mean that we have a high potential to continue to outpace the market? And we've outgrown the market for now 2 decades. And I think that this just reinforces for our customers why having Amphenol as your first phone call is a really important principle and a very helpful way to run your supply chain. Operator : Now our next question is from James Suva of Citigroup Investment Research. James Suva : And it's nice to see Amphenol continue to make acquisitions. In the past history, sometimes acquisitions have been companies that really needed a global footprint for sales or a global manufacturing footprint or helping to polish their operations. And others have been strategic to help the company grow in the future. But the recently announced acquisitions that you just talked about today, can you help us figure which they are more for the growth or health of operations and you can really improve their profitability or go to market? How do they fit into the Amphenol family? Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Jim. I mean, look, our criteria for acquisitions has always started with two things, and that's people and the products, in other words, the technology that those companies have. And so the very first test for us is, are we acquiring a company that has people who have passion, drive, integrity and entrepreneurial spirit that we think will fit into the Amphenol organization. And then second, do they have unique enabling technologies that ultimately solve real problems for their customers. And then when we found those companies, we don't focus on either growth or on improvement in operating performance. We try to do both of those things. And our acquisition program, which has been so successful over so many years, has really been successful because we were able to find ways to accelerate the growth of those companies and find ways to improve their operating performance. And so I would say that the 3 acquisitions that we're talking about today, of course, MTS being far and away bigger than Euromicron or Cabelcon, they all share that great potential, both from a top line growth perspective, taking advantage of being part of Amphenol, taking advantage of being part of a global company with strong partnership, preferred supplier relationships with customers across all of our end markets, but also being part of a company that has access to low-cost manufacturing when appropriate, who has access to collaborative initiatives across the company from a technology or sourcing perspective that ultimately can help to drive better operating performance. And so I would say, with these 3 companies, we think that they all have great growth and profitability improvement potential, despite their very different scales. Operator : Now our next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : A question, Craig, regarding your commentary about some cost headwinds weighing somewhat on your margins. Could you quantify that in terms of maybe what in terms of basis points you've seen? And is that just an issue that you see persisting over the next couple of quarters that we're hearing from other suppliers as well? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I just want to start by saying we are actually extremely proud of the ability to achieve these strong operating margins in the first quarter, I mean, 19.6% in this challenging environment while we still have COVID costs. And then on top of that, we've seen certainly increasingly challenging commodity and supply chain environment. I think it's really just a great achievement, and I really am happy with the performance of the general managers to be able to offset some of these costs that they're seeing. The reality is, is that we have seen increasing challenging environment as we come into the first quarter. To quantify that is a little bit difficult. But I think the way I would think about it is that if you -- as we kind of came into the first quarter from the fourth quarter, sequentially, we would expect a typical close to 30% kind of sequential downside conversion. So really, the gap between that is -- the vast majority of that, I think, is really the pressures from the commodity and supply chain environment. I mean there is some small component related to some of the acquisitions of Positronic as well as Euromicron that we closed earlier in the quarter. But the vast majority really would be that kind of cost environment that we're seeing some headwinds from.  In terms of how long that will last, I mean there's certainly -- we're doing -- I think the team is again doing a good job of trying to offset some of that, I think, through taking some cost actions and over time, maybe also through passing on some of those increases to customers to the extent you can't do it within the factories. But I don't think this is necessarily something that we're going to be able to necessarily get through in the quarter. So that certainly is still included in kind of our second quarter guidance that we gave is expect to still have some of those headwinds we haven't guided to the rest of the year. So I guess I won't comment on that. But certainly, I think that this environment that we find ourselves in now, I'm very happy with kind of what we've been able to achieve in terms of offsetting a certain level of those costs. But I think that the reality is that the -- we're probably sitting here at least for another quarter here with some of those cost headwinds that we see today. Adam Norwitt : And Matt, I would just add to that a little color. There are certain parts of this, which are pretty significant cost differences in commodities, for example. I mean, they're all very well reported. And the way that Amphenol operates is we have close to 125 general managers around the world, and each of them is really tuning their operation in light of the costs that are hitting them, in particular.  So you take an example, a general manager in our cable business, which has a very high component of material cost, very significant in our cable segment, there's not a choice, but to go and work with customers and to make sure you take a leadership position in adjusting price to account for those commodity prices. And we would certainly expect that others in the industry would have that same dynamic. And that's just one example of how it goes.  But the beauty is that these general managers have every tool available to them to adjust, whether it's from the price you sell to the customer, to every element of cost are all in the power of the general managers. And when you see a sudden increase in some of these things, it can take a short while to work through it. But Craig and I are confident that over time, our team is going to manage this, as they always have. Operator : Now our next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : This quarter was certainly a good illustration of Amphenol's leadership and operational flexibility, but I'd still be interested in understanding if you're thinking of any -- making any changes in how the company operates going forward in terms of things like how you're sourcing material, where you locate manufacturing or inventory management once you have some time to fully reflect on how COVID and some of the trade issues have stressed global supply chains or even just because Amphenol is becoming a bigger company with the M&A that you've done, including most recently with MTS? Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, the answer I'll give you is really 2 sides. The answer is no, we think that our approach, our culture, the unique entrepreneurial organizational structure that we have had in Amphenol for many decades is uniquely tailored to an environment like we've been in and to an environment like we're headed into. But the other answer is yes, every day, meaning we're making changes every day. We're not making those changes from here at headquarters. We're not deciding on a blanket approach like we're going to go out of one country and go into this country, or we're going to increase our inventory this much or we're going to change how we're sourcing things. But those general managers around the world are every day making course corrections. And some of them pretty significant course corrections in the moment to react to the environment that is around them.  So when tariffs came in, you'll remember this already, it seems like so long ago that there was the thing called tariffs several years ago. But our team immediately reacted to that in every way possible from moving production to changing logistical flows, to doing lots of other things to passing on the price to customers when there was no other option. And that was a real-time, in the moment kind of transformation, but not at a corporate level, rather it was at the individual operating unit levels.  And I think as we've gone through the pandemic, as we see the very robust demand coming out of this part of the cycle, we're making lots of changes every day to make sure that we remain the most competitive, that we are able to outperform the market at the highest degree possible and that we're able to deliver to the bottom line superior operating profitability and ultimately convert that to cash. And those are just day-to-day decisions that are made by our general managers, obviously, in some consultation with us. But ultimately, the proof, I think, is really in the pudding of that approach. Operator : Now our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach : Just questions on MTS. I think their operating margins are roughly in the mid-teens. And I know other acquisitions you've done in the past where they've been lower. There's a path to kind of get them to corporate average. So just curious if there's any similarities or differences in terms of that approach for this deal? And then, Adam, you mentioned a number of the key markets for MTS where they play. Any of those stand out in particular from a growth perspective that you're most excited about? Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Craig. I think you're roughly accurate about the operating margins with MTS. Obviously, there will be some amortization, and we include amortization in our numbers, so that they can have a little bit of downward impact on the operating margins. But you're right, I mean every company who comes into Amphenol thinks about how are they going to achieve, ultimately, that growth in margins to get up to the Amphenol corporate average or above.  Obviously, an average is just an average, and there are some above and some below. And I would tell you that the management team in the MTS Sensors business is an extraordinarily capable team of individuals. The gentleman who leads that business, who led the business inside of MTS, who, by the way, led the predecessor family-owned company that was acquired by MTS, I mean this is a just truly outstanding individual who also likes to see that his company is doing as well as his sister companies. And there's no doubt about it that there's a little bit of peer pressure inside of Amphenol when you come in and see the margins of your peers. And something tells me that that's an organization that does not want to be below the average. And how long is that going to take? That's always a question. But when there's is a will, there's a way. And I think this is a team that has an extraordinary will to make that happen. In terms of the markets with the MTS Sensors business, I talked already that they have strong position in industrial and military and then in commercial air and automotive, roughly in that order, I would say, in terms of magnitude. And they participate in just some of the most exciting applications within those. MTS makes products that are really at the cutting edge of the harsh environment, high-performance requirements of some of these systems. So when you're making like a turbine, and that turbine, be it a gas turbine or a windmill, and you want to know that, that thing is operating with good function and smoothly and that there's no issues inside the turbine. You're going to use a sensor from MTS, or a number of sensors, let me say, that are going to be in the most harsh of environments, hot, out in the middle of the ocean, you name it, that are going to ultimately tell you, is your system working or not and do you need to go maintain that. That's just one example of these extraordinary harsh environment vibration, force, pressure and position sensors that they sell.  I had the good fortune to go around to several of the factories just in the last couple of weeks. And had been there, of course, before. But going now as the owner is a little bit different. And not only do you see products that are truly at the high leading edge of sensor technology, but these are sensor products where the harsh environment interconnect packaging of those sensors is almost of equal import to the good functioning of the product in the systems where they participate. And so we see just great opportunities in the industrial market, across many segments of the industrial market, in the military market, as I spoke earlier, where we have already a leading position in military interconnect. We're just really excited to now have a significant position also in sensors in the military market as well in automotive and in commercial air. And so we see great opportunities really across the markets of MTS and look forward to taking full advantage for many years to come. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein of Truist Securities. William Stein : Congrats on the very good results today. I would like to ask you about the commercial aerospace end market. That end market was already in a pretty significant downturn because of the 737 MAX grounding and then we had COVID obviously stopped travel and demand for planes. But I think you guided this segment up sequentially. And I wonder if that's an indication that you think we're past the bottom here. And I wonder what you're seeing in terms of recovery, what you're seeing in the order book and maybe what you're hearing more anecdotally from your customers? Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Will. Yes, I mean, it's a tough time in the commercial air market. There's no doubt about it. I mean it's hard to think of a market that was not -- that was more heavily impacted over the last 1.5 years than the commercial air market. It represents now just 2% of our sales. And we did guide it up sequentially in the quarter ahead. Although I would say that that's really the impact of the MTS Sensors acquisition. I don't know that I would necessarily say that I'm kind of calling a bottom, so to speak. But clearly, the rate is declining. The rate of decline on a sequential basis is getting smaller. It's down by just 3% sequentially in the quarter, which is, I guess, a green shoot of encouragement, if you will. But the commercial air market has a tough road ahead of it. And our team working in that market is doing everything they can to continue to diversify their business to make sure that the products that they sell, which have other applications, are being proliferated and we're re-devoting resources to designing in those products into other applications, where they can be very enabling technologies such that when the commercial air market does eventually come back, which it will, we're not going back to horses and buggies, we will be flying again one day. And I hope to be doing so very soon after I get my second shot tomorrow morning together with Craig. That market will come back. And when it comes back, our operations working in that market will be stronger than ever because they will have taken this opportunity to diversify themselves, diversify their product sets, leverage their resources in a broader fashion. And I think that's the way to deal with a crisis like this, and that's always been the Amphenol way. Operator : Now our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Joseph Giordano : So we've heard kind of like different strategies and different responses from many companies this season about how they're dealing with sourcing of components that are in scarcity. And we've heard some say that the ability to like leverage all their individual businesses as one big customer kind of gives them leverage at suppliers. I think you guys are probably going the other way. Can you kind of talk about how the structure of Amphenol as kind of small independent companies essentially gives them an advantage when sourcing? Is it because some of these businesses are small enough that they're -- it's not a big quantity that they need? Can you maybe just talk us through that relative to some other maybe ways to accomplish that? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Look, Joe, we try to have the best of both worlds in sourcing. And so at the end of the day, sourcing happens under the purview of those 125 general managers around the world. And sometimes it's good to be small and sometimes it's good to be big. And what we try to do is we present ourselves as whichever is most beneficial in the moment. So we oftentimes are a few general managers who buy a common material will work together and they may go together to a vendor. That's what gets us the results that we need. But in other cases, it's a very local decision where maybe a purchasing person says to a local sales rep, hey, just sneak me what I need here, no one's going to notice. And in between both of those, there's a whole spectrum of techniques, strategies, tactics that our supply chain team around the world will be taking.  The most important principle, though, is this, if you have supply chain disconnected from the business, it's actually really hard to decide, ultimately, am I doing the right thing? How do I -- what if I need to redesign something? Well, if there's this monolithic engineering team and a monolithic sourcing team and the sourcing team says, we can't get this part, we need to redesign it, and it has to go sort of up and down the corporate chain to get that redesign resources to be allocated or to convince the engineer to do so, that can be a very laborious process. Whereas in our organization, the purchasing person is sitting in the door right next to the engineering person reporting to the general manager who's 2 doors down from her. And they can just get in the room together and say, look, we can't find this thing, let's redesign it right now, let's reallocate the resources, let's make it happen. And it's that kind of real-time, connected to the business approach. Whether it is dealing with shortages, whether it's dealing with logistical challenges, whether it's dealing with quality issues, whether it's dealing with new design, whatever, we've always found that, that approach can be very effective. But we try to be what will make us be the most successful, let's say that. Operator : Our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. David Kelley : Just hoping to follow up on automotive. Really robust growth versus underlying production in the quarter. You referenced electrification wins as a contributor. And then you mentioned broadly, you aren't seeing channel inventory build, but I would assume you delivered to market share gains and then probably benefited from favorable mix as well. Just hoping you can walk us through some of the drivers of you're really showing automotive performance in the quarter. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you know the underlying market much better than I do. You could teach a master class on it, for sure. But what I would tell you is our team in all regions really performed very strongly here. And we saw great growth really across the board, across the regions. And we saw disproportionate growth from new programs that we're -- that we've long worked to design ourselves in on relative to EVs. But it wasn't exclusively EVs. We saw growth in lots of other new platforms as well. And I think our long-term share gains in the automotive market, and I referenced this earlier, is really a function of us focusing our efforts on next-generation technologies in car, next-generation systems, next-generation applications, everything from passenger comfort and connectivity, to safety, to engine management, emissions control and obviously, high voltage related to EVs and hybrid EVs.  And I think all of those things are helping us to outperform the broader market in a quarter like we just had here in the first quarter, but also over a very long time period. We're really talking about the better part of the decade, where we have had a relatively consistent performance that is a decent amount, if not far in excess of the underlying unit production volumes that are out there.  So there's not like 1 silver bullet to this. I think it's been a collective approach. It's been our acquisition program, where we've added new companies, both interconnect, antenna and sensor companies. And it's a lot of work on engineering of next-generation systems that go into these cars across all of the regions. And I think when we put all that together, ultimately, we've seen strong performance. Operator : Now our next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I wanted to get your views on mobile networks. You mentioned you had better revenue than you expected in the quarter. You're guiding to sequential improvement in revenues. And how should I think about visibility or sustainability of this improvement through the rest of the year? And how correlated is that going to be to some of the like 5G CapEx plans that the North American telcos recently outlined? How much of that is going to probably help sustain some of this growth through the rest of the year? Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Samik. Well, look, we're really pleased with the sequential growth that we saw in this market. Obviously, that's a market that, over the last year or 2, has not always had the most robust growth as the operators have somehow struggled. There's been a lot of corporate things going on, delays in investment last year. We also saw some redeployment of the investment towards really the core of the networks to support the massive growth in bandwidth. But we've always talked about the fact that our team has been working diligently over many years to design in our products into next-generation systems and networks, be they 5G or otherwise.  And I think we start to see kind of some early progress with that here in the first quarter. And to the extent that operators are expanding their investment, we would hope to benefit from that. It may not always be in a perfect quarter-to-quarter correlation. We don't have a position with absolutely every operator with the exact same degree of success. But we have a very strong position on the equipment, that is really going to enable 5G for the long term. And so to the extent that 5G creates incremental capital spending, which, again, has yet to be perfectly articulated, then, for sure, we would feel like we would be in a good position to be able to benefit from that in the medium and long term. Operator : Our next question is from Luke Junk from Baird. Luke Junk : Adam, you mentioned hybrids and electric vehicles especially as a growth driver in your end market discussion of both auto and industrial trends this afternoon. Could you help us better understand the span of EV-related products, especially across those two segments? And in particular, I'm wondering how might differentiate the company's opportunity set versus some of your connector peers that have a more auto-based focus. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Luke. Yes. No, you picked up on that very astutely. We participate in the electrification of vehicles, whether those are passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles, and both have been really great drivers for us in recent quarters and years. And in the industrial, we talk about that industrial battery and the heavy vehicles. There's a wide range of vehicles that are undergoing electrification right now from big trucks, and there's plenty of news media around that, to postal vehicles and trash trucks and buses and goods vehicles, delivery vans, you name it. And so all of that is what we classify really in our industrial business or industrial market as that battery heavy vehicle.  And then when we talk about automotive, the hybrid EV, that's really passenger cars and the related products. In addition, we think about the charging infrastructure for electrification as really an infrastructure piece and that we think about in our industrial business as well. And that's all -- those are all components of areas where we've seen strong performance in -- certainly in the first quarter and over a number of years and look forward to that. Because I think if you confine your view of electrification just to passenger vehicles, you're missing a really exciting area of the electronics revolution, which is that electrification more broadly.  By the way, I mean, we're working as well with the Department of Defense in certain countries on the electrification of military vehicles, which, I think, is going to be a long process. But over the long term, we see that as an area that can also be another benefit and another growth lever along this just real kind of, call it, a megatrend, if you will, of electrification across kind of all things that move. Operator : Now our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Craig, I just wanted to talk a little bit more about your extra costs in the coming quarter. If I applied your analysis for Q1 to Q2, it looks like the pressure is about $20 million or so, similar to Q1. I imagine there's some M&A impacting your incrementals. But can you talk about whether that's in the ballpark and what you guys are doing to sort of reduce that $20 million nut going forward? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, actually, your math probably isn't so far off. It's certainly in the range of what we'd probably quantify that as. And if you look sequentially going from Q1 to Q2, essentially, a lot of that growth is our acquisitions that we just announced. So as you can imagine, the sequential conversion is going to be a little bit lower than your typical conversion just because those are -- acquisitions are at a lower profitability level as an average of the company.  And clearly, as we talked about with MTS specifically, but also related to the other 2, over time, we would expect to be able to work those up to the company average. But as we -- talking about Q2 specifically, that sequential conversion really mostly is impacted related to the acquisitions. But essentially, the cost impact that you just quantified is kind of is in that ballpark that we had in Q1 essentially we're expecting to still see in Q2 as the team continues to work through all those actions to ultimately, over time, neutralize those impacts. Operator : As of this time, we don't have any further questions on queue. Now I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lampo for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, this is Mr. Norwitt. But anyway, thank you very much, and we truly appreciate everybody's time today on the call. And I did want to take a moment just to wish everybody good health here. And I hope everybody is getting the chance to be vaccinated soon, wherever you may be. And I wanted to make just a special comment and note about any of you who may have friends or family in India. We obviously have an organization in India, and we're very carefully attentive to the ongoing situation with the pandemic there and doing our part to help the communities in India. And I just wanted to send our best wishes to any of you on the phone here today with family and friends in India. It's a fabulous country, and I'm sure they're going to work their way through this difficult stage in the pandemic.  Thank you all to everybody and wish you all good health, and we'll talk to you all in the next 90 days. Craig Lampo : Thank you, everybody. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for attending today's conference. Have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO. And I\u2019m here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2021 conference call. Our second quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then, Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends. And then we\u2019ll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing-operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $2.654 billion, and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.61 respectively. Sales were up 34% in U.S. dollars, 30% in local currencies and 22% organically compared to the second quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies, and 7% organically. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.120 billion, which was up 50% compared to the second quarter of 2020, and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 to 1. Breaking down sales into our 2 segments, the interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 34% in U.S. dollars, and 30% in local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Our cable segment, which comprise 4% of our sales was up 27% in U.S. dollars and 24% local currencies compared to the second quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $476 million and $532 million respectively in the second quarter of 2021. GAAP operating income includes $55 million of transactions, severance, restructuring and certain other non-cash costs related to the MTS acquisition. And the company also incurred $34 million related to the extinguishment of outstanding MTS senior notes. That in accordance with GAAP was recorded as an increase to goodwill in the second quarter, and therefore, had no impact on the second quarter earnings. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 20%, which increased by strong 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on the higher sales volumes and a lower cost impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the impact of the challenging commodity and supply chain environment that we experienced in this year\u2019s quarter. The sequential increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by the normal conversion on the increased sales levels, partially offset by the impact of MTS Sensors business, which is currently operating below the company\u2019s average operating margin. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment margins were 22% in the second quarter of 2021, which increased from 20% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 50 basis points sequentially. In the cable segment, margins were 6.1%, which decreased from 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020 and 8.8% in the first quarter. These lower margins in the cable segment are directly related to the rapid increases in the prices of certain commodity and logistics costs, which we have not yet been able to offset with pricing actions. Given the dynamic market environment, we are very proud of the company\u2019s performance. Our team\u2019s ability to effectively manage through the current market challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company\u2019s entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance action-oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.5%, which compare to 20.7% in the second quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, this effective tax rate was 24.5% in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.59, an increase of 40% compared to the $0.42 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.61, an increase of 53% compared to $0.40 in the second quarter of 2020. The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Operating cash flow was $411 million in the second quarter, or 109% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $307 million or 81% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding, and payable days were 85, 71 and 60 days respectively, all excluding the impact of acquisitions in the quarter and within our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for approximately $167 million, at an average price of approximately $67. At the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $4 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $597 million, and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the sale of MTS Test & Simulation business, net leverage at June 30, 2021 would have been 1.3 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation, and therefore, it\u2019s expected results are excluded from our Q3 guidance. In addition, in conjunction with the divestiture of the Test & Simulation business, the company will incur certain additional cash tax related another acquisition related cost in the third quarter, which will not be included in income from continuing operation, and therefore are not included in our guidance. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig. And I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the call today. And I hope that you, your family, friends and colleagues continue to stay safe and healthy and indeed are able to enjoy the summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I\u2019m going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I\u2019ll then get into a discussion of the trends, and our trends and progress across our served markets. I\u2019ll make some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter. And then, of course, we\u2019ll have time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were substantially better than expected, as we exceeded the high-end of our guidance and sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Craig already mentioned our sales grow very strong 34% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local currency is reaching a new record of $2.654 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 22% with growth driven in particular by the automotive, military, industrial and broadband markets, as well as contributions from the company\u2019s acquisition program. We\u2019re very pleased to book record orders in the quarter of $3.120 billion, and that represented a very strong book-to-bill of 1.18 to 1. Despite facing operational challenges in certain geographies related to the ongoing pandemic as well as continued increases in costs related to commodities and supply chain pressures. We were very pleased to deliver very strong adjusted operating margins of 20.0% in the quarter. This was a 200 basis point increase from last year\u2019s levels, and a 40 basis point improvement sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS grew very significant 53% from prior year to another new record of $0.61 and just an outstanding reflection of our continued strong execution. And then, finally, the company generated operating and free cash flow of $411 million and $307 million respectively in the second quarter. I just can\u2019t emphasize enough how proud I am of our organization around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization. As we have continued to perform well amidst, what is a very dynamic and challenging environment? Very pleased that in the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Unlimited Services. Unlimited based in Oconto, Wisconsin, but also with operations in Mexico and has annual sales of approximately $50 million. This is a great manufacturer of cable assemblies for the industrial market primarily, with a particular focus on heavy vehicles. The addition of unlimited broadens our already strong position in value-add interconnect products that are integrated into a wide array of industrial applications. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets, I just would comment once again, how pleased we are that the company is broad and balanced, and market diversification continues to create real value for us. We believe that ultimately, this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also giving us broad exposure to leading technologies and the innovations of those technologies, wherever they may arise across the broad scope of the electronics industry. Turning to the military market, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And as expected sales grew a strong 45% from the COVID impacted prior year second quarter, and were up 30% organically and this was really driven by broad strength across virtually all segments of the military market. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 12%, also very strong. As we look into the third quarter, we remains \u2013 we expect sales to remain at these current elevated levels. And we continue to be very excited by the strength of our position in the military market. And that position is really based upon our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and now sensor products. Together with our support of essentially all major military programs, this gives us great confidence for our long-term performance in this important area. The commercial air market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% versus prior year really with the benefit of the contributions of our recent acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales were declined \u2013 were down by about 14%, as the commercial aircraft market continued to experience declines in demand for new aircraft production. Sequentially, however, our sales did increase by better than expected 19%. And that\u2019s really from the benefit of the MTS acquisition as well as some organic progress. As we look ahead, we expect a slight seasonal moderation in sales in the third quarter, which we would typically see in commercial air. And regardless of the ongoing difficult environment, our team working in this commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company\u2019s strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic, we look forward to jet manufacturers beginning to expand their production levels. The industrial market represented 27% of our sales in the quarter, and our performance in the second quarter and industrial was really much stronger than expected with sales increasing by 54% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. This growth was broad-based across most areas of the worldwide industrial market, and was driven in particular by organic strength in the transportation, battery and heavy electric vehicle, marine and energy generation segments, together with the contributions from our acquisitions that have been completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, sales increased by very strong 26% from the first quarter, really with the benefit of acquisitions as well as strong organic performance. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these elevated levels, despite what would typically be a seasonally lower quarter. I can\u2019t say enough how proud I am of our team working in the industrial market. And we\u2019ve had a long-term strategy to expand our high technology, interconnect, antenna and sensor offering both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions. And that strategy has positioned us strongly with industrial customers around the world, who are accelerating their adoption of electronics. The acquisition of Unlimited Services further bolsters our leading value-add capabilities in this important market and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The Automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. And I just say that sales were higher than our expectations, probably a very strong 134% in U.S. dollars and 117% organically, as our team was able to execute strongly in the face of a robust and broad recovery in the automotive market. In particular, we once again drove very strong growth of our products used in electric \u2013 hybrid electric vehicles this quarter, which confirms again for us our global team\u2019s long-term efforts at designing in high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these important next generation platforms. Despite an increase in production disruptions among our automotive customers, due to the widely reported global supply chain issues, we were able to achieve a small sequential increase in our sales, which was a bit better than we had expected coming into the quarter. No doubt about it, though, there continued to be a range of widely reported supply chain challenges that that are rising within the automotive industry and this is impacting overall demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, as we look towards the third quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in our sales. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year as reduced production levels. While expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is still facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. Turning to the mobile devices market, that market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales to customers in the mobile devices market declined from prior year by 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically, as declines in handsets and laptops more than offset growth in wearables. And I would just remind you that our last year second quarter did include a significant sequential recovery and really a catch up from the COVID impacted first quarter of 2020, which made the comparison versus prior year a little more challenging. Sequentially, our sales felt by 6% from the first quarter, which was modestly better than our expectations. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect an approximately 25% increase in sales from these second quarter levels as we benefit from the seasonally typical higher demand in the mobile device market as customers launch a range of new products. While mobile devices remains the most volatile of Amphenol end markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in the second half of 2021 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long-term in this exciting market. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat to prior year and down 4% organically. The sales to both OEMs and the wireless service providers moderated. On a sequential basis, however, our sales increased by 5% compared to the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the second quarter. And as we look towards the third quarter, we expect a further increase in sales as mobile networks customers ramp up their investments in next generation networks. Our team around the world continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts at expanding our position in such next generation networks and the equipment that populates them around the world. And as customers ramp up these investments of such advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market increased by 21% in the second quarter. Sales in the second quarter rose by 5% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically from the very significant levels in last year\u2019s second quarter. Our strength this quarter was driven in particular by robust sales to web service providers, which was partially offset by some weakness in sales to network equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales grew a very strong 20% from the first quarter, which significantly outperformed our original expectations. Looking now into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these very high levels. We remain very encouraged by the company\u2019s outstanding position in the global IT data comm market. Our OEM and web service provider customers around the world continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team is singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT data comm, with industry-leading high-speed, power, and fiber-optic interconnect products. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. Turning finally to the broadband market, this market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 12% from prior year and were flat organically as we benefited from our recent acquisition of Cabelcon. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 7% from the first quarter, which was a bit lower than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. For the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from current levels, as operators digest the really high levels of spending that they have exhibited over the recent quarters. And regardless of this more muted outlook, we continue to look forward to supporting our broadband service operator customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and I would just note that given the current dynamic market environment, and of course, assuming no new material disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as constant exchange rates. In the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.640 billion to $2.700 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. This would represent sales growth of 14% to 16%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 9% to 13% compared to the third quarter of last year. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding entrepreneurial management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. I can just say that our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term and sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire global Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we\u2019ll be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Thank you. And, participants, we will now begin our question. Please be reminded that questioners are only allowed to ask one question. Now, our first question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Adam, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing as far as inventory levels go, particularly in the channel in industrial where you expect that low-teens growth quarter on quarter? You grew almost double that. If you could give us some sense of where things stand, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Wamsi. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past that we don\u2019t have necessarily perfect visibility into the inventory, in particular of our OEM and service provider customers. But as far as the channel is concerned, we have not seen any real changes in the inventory levels. In fact, it appears that for the vast majority of our distributors, in particular, with respect to the industrial market, they want to ship it out as soon as we can get it to them. There\u2019s clearly a very significant end-demand across really many segments of the industrial market. And I mentioned earlier that we saw growth across virtually every segment of the industrial market, and whether that was in marine applications, in industrial batteries, in electrification of industrial vehicles, in transportation, heavy equipment, factory automation. I mean, we saw even growth in areas like oil and gas, where we haven\u2019t seen so much growth in the past. Instrumentation, where we continued to see very robust performance over a long time period. So I wouldn\u2019t say that across the industrial market we\u2019ve seen necessarily any worrisome inventory trends. I think that more broadly across the whole company, again, maybe the only area where you hear talk of inventory issues acutely is that there is not a lot of inventory of cars on lots right now. And so, I don\u2019t know what that means through the whole chain. But for sure, dealer inventories of vehicles are extremely low by any measure. And I think there is a lot of supply chain issues that are going on around the automotive industry that I\u2019m sure others will ask about, and many have spoken about and reported about. But by and large, we see inventory as relatively healthy. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Sir, line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thanks a lot and good afternoon. I guess, my question is around the supply chain dynamics, as well I\u2019d love to understand, Adam, how is it on to \u2013 how is it playing out for Amphenol from operations, from a P&L basis, what\u2019s the impact on your revenue and margin that\u2019s coming from the supply chain issues? And then, beyond the operational challenges, I\u2019d love to understand, does this create an opportunity for you over time to win new customers, to have new share gain? And if so, which segment of those opportunity is bigger? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, well, thank you very much, Amit. Look, I mean, the current supply chain environment is certainly not for the faint of heart. And I think our agility as an organization that, that unique entrepreneurship of what we call Amphenoleans around the world, in many ways, is an ideal approach to deal with a supply chain environment that is so broadly disrupted, and where new things pop up every day. And so, could we have shipped a little bit more in certain cases? I\u2019m sure we probably could have. Did it cost us money? In many cases, I\u2019m sure it did. To put a number on that is not easy for us to do. But I can tell you that it\u2019s more than zero. And I think, for sure, the cost of the supply chain, whether that\u2019s freight and logistics, whether that\u2019s the cost of commodities, the availability of certain things, a lot of stuff went on over the course of this quarter. There was floods in Germany. There were challenges with various countries. There were some COVID-related things that were happening in particular in places like Southeast Asia. So our general managers, all 125 of them, each of them had to deal with a unique set of challenges. And they had to tailor make their approach to exactly what they were facing. It wasn\u2019t that we had to sort of process all of this in this sort of corporate wayback machine, and then issue a bunch of edicts to say, here\u2019s what we should do. It was really dealt with on an individual case-by-case basis in the moment. And that kind of moment-by-moment management, it is a real premium in a time like this. And, as it relates to your second question or the second part of your question, for sure, if we are satisfying the needs of our customers, better than our competitors are doing in a time when they need us the most, when they have robust demand from their customers, when they\u2019re facing a much broader array of supply chain challenges, because fortunate for us, we don\u2019t buy a ton of semiconductors. We buy a little bit here and there. But we have a lot of customers who are facing really existential kind of shortages in certain semiconductors. And when we can help them, for example, they\u2019re redesigning a system to change a chip that they can\u2019t get support of. They\u2019re redesigning that. And all of a sudden, that redesign requires them to completely redesign an interconnect system. Our team does it. In one case, we did this in 5 days. A customer came to us, said they had to totally change the design of their system. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have a chip for a year. They redesigned it. Our team went, completely redesigned the system, 5 days later, sent them samples. And they came to us with big orders thereafter. So those are the kind of situations that are popping up more and more. And I think long-term customers don\u2019t forget if you were there for them when they needed you the most. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup Investment Research. Sir, your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team for all the hard work during the challenging times. I wanted to ask a question kind of on raw material and input costs. And, of course, we\u2019ve seen them all kind of skyrocket. Does that mean your sales people need to be more active or change terms or do you have like indexing into your contracts when raw materials go up a lot? I assume some of your contracts are very long-term in nature or do you hedge it out with some financial instruments? I\u2019m just kind of curious, because it\u2019s pretty unprecedented that copper, steel or aluminum, resins and costs have recently been moving a lot. Thank you so much. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much, Jim. And no doubt about it. I mean, there are certain dynamics, which one could call unprecedented. And I think, amidst that unprecedented inflationary environment on certain commodities, we were able to deliver exactly 20% adjusted operating margins here in the quarter, which I think is a testament to the hard work of our team around the world. Each of whom is facing a different set of challenges. But no doubt about it, if you\u2019re a general manager in Amphenol, we don\u2019t tie their hands, and say, you\u2019re only in charge of this or you\u2019re only in charge of that. They have every lever to pull in order to ultimately meet their obligations to reach their performance objective. And so, that means when all of your input prices have gone up, you\u2019re going to figure a way out of that. And sometimes when they go up very quickly, that makes it hard, and no doubt about it. We\u2019ve seen relatively quick increases in a lot of different input costs. And again, not just commodities, but also the cost of freight and other logistics. And that sometimes there can be a little bit of a delay, if that comes in so fast. But by and large, our interactions with customers, the sort of contracts or programs that we have with them, generally, they\u2019re not indexed. And as you know, we generally don\u2019t hedge either. And the reason we don\u2019t hedge is because then you are kind of detached from the reality of the moment when you want to have discussions with customers. And those discussions with customers, for sure, are ongoing, because when you have such significant increases in the input costs, we\u2019re going to do everything in our power to offset those costs with our own management, redesigning the products, changing suppliers, pitting our suppliers against each other, reducing overhead, reducing every aspect. But sometimes there is only the option to pass that price, that cost increase onto your customer. We do that very thoughtfully. Every market is a little bit different, how that works. But our customers know that we don\u2019t do that lightly. We don\u2019t take that initiative lightly. But ultimately, you sometimes do have to pass the price on. And I can tell you, our sales teams around the world, together with our operating teams, they\u2019re working hand in hand, to make sure that we\u2019ve done everything possible before we go into a customer and ask for them to share in the pain of these increases. But when you have such severe and sudden increases, ultimately, then the pricing does become very important. And I think our team is working that. It\u2019s hard work. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But I think our teams is making really good progress in that front. And again, it\u2019s very market dependent. It\u2019s very region dependent. But there\u2019s no one I would want more than a general manager who knows her business front to back, to be the one who sits in front of a customer and decides is this now the right moment to ask that customer to share in the challenges that we\u2019re facing. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to talk about MTS and perhaps you can share some of your early impressions of the company and what opportunities you may be seeing to not only sell the MTS centers on a standalone basis, but combine it into full solutions or something or other product lines. And, on a related note with MTS, Craig, I think you said the margins are still below corporate average. Maybe talk about when you see that getting back in line with the Amphenol average. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Mark. I\u2019ll let Craig talk about the margins in a second. But I can just tell you, our early impressions of the company are very, very positive. I mean, we said and I think I mentioned last quarter, that MTS, the Sensors business is run by a team that we know well. And in particular, the person leading that organization is just a phenomenal, phenomenal leader who has an extraordinary organization underneath him. And the way that they have embraced being part of Amphenol is just truly rewarding for all of us in the company. We\u2019ve known them for a long time. This was not a new acquaintance that we made through this process, but rather we\u2019ve known them all the way back to when they were part of a family-owned company that ultimately MTS acquired. Our customers have received this extremely well. We\u2019ve become more important to customers across the markets, whether that be industrial, military, commercial air and automotive. I continue to be just amazed by the uniqueness and the depth of the technology that we acquired in this business, force, vibration, sensors, pressure sensors, position, just a variety of products that really operate at the harshest of environments and with the highest of performance. In terms of being able to sell more complete solutions, I can tell you that there\u2019s already early activities, real collaborative activities ongoing across the company, with people within our interconnect businesses, working together, getting to know the MTS Sensors organization, creating the sort of fiber of the relationships that ultimately can lead long-term to really collaborative success in the various markets that we serve. So all early returns for MTS, including their absolute performance, which is coming out a little bit better than we had thought in the quarter. All early returns are favorable. And I\u2019ll let Craig maybe comment specifically on the margin. Craig Lampo : Yeah, Mark, thanks for the question on the margin. As you mentioned, I did, I have mentioned in the past that there, mid-teens profitability when we acquired them. As Adam mentioned, we were just really happy with the progress they\u2019ve made, and kind of all aspects honestly of the business. From a profitability perspective, we always say that profit ultimately is really just the byproduct of the value that you bring to kind of your customers, and there\u2019s no doubt that this company brings a lot of value to all their customers, and we believe that there\u2019s plenty of opportunity throughout the business to be able to increase that profitability in the business. I will tell you that even in the second quarter, I say, we have seen green shoots, I guess of progress in that area. The time it will take ultimately to get them to that company average or beyond is certainly, will be told in the future here on that, and we\u2019re not necessarily going to try to estimate that at this time vis-\u00e0-vis every acquisition is different. And the task that need to happen differentiating amount of time. But I would tell you that the \u2013 second quarter here, the first quarter that we\u2019ve had them. As part of Amphenol, we\u2019ve certainly seen some progress in that area, and certainly areas of opportunity in the future. And I would say that we\u2019re even more optimistic, and we were optimistic in early on that that they will be able to ultimately get to that target that we have for them to be at the company average, and hopefully beyond in the future. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is from William Stein from Truist. Elliot Smith : Hi. This is Elliot Smith on for Will. I wanted to ask about the mobile devices end market. I know it can be quite volatile quarter-to-quarter. But can you speak to what you are seeing now and potentially over the next several quarters in terms of the end market content trajectory and potential growth? Adam Norwitt : So thanks very much, Elliot. I think you correctly termed that it is a very volatile market on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are year-over-year \u2013 the year-over-year performance in the market was significantly impacted by the strength that we had a year-ago in the second quarter, which was really a catch up from the significant COVID impacts that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. This is not a market I\u2019d like to get out ahead of my skis on in terms of several quarters out and giving a prognosis. But what I can say is that our position in the mobile market is an extremely strong position, we continue to have a unique ability to react quickly to customers when they need us the most. And that includes sometimes when our competitors aren\u2019t able to support the customers, in particular, when they\u2019re launching new products. Our guidance for the third quarter being up about 25% or so on a quarter-to-quarter basis is a strong outlook. And I think not inconsistent, if you look over a long time period with a kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory. What it will be in the quarters thereafter, again, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of my skis and giving a prognosis on mobile devices over the long-term. But the content opportunity, as you say, there\u2019s no reason to think that the content opportunity with these devices as they become more complicated as they have different feature sets, as they support different types of communication standards in them. Those have usually been in the past strong drivers of content in mobile devices and we have no reason to believe that that would change in the future. Operator : Thank you. Now our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph Giordano : Can you guys hear me? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Hi, Joe. Joseph Giordano : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just curious on IT-Datacom, I mean, you guys came in so much stronger than your initial view last quarter. Just curious, how would you categorize that from like within market dynamics, just the overall spending in the industry was significantly better, where you guys picking up specific share anywhere? How would you categorize that outperformance relative to your initial view? Adam Norwitt : Joe, I guess, it\u2019s a combination of sort of all the above, and our team continues to do a phenomenal job in IT-Datacom, in particular, a phenomenal job enabling web service providers whose spending and we can call them web service providers like either you can call them cloud providers or whatever. And the fact is the service providers who are making meaningful and very meaningful investments in high speed data processing in order to enable the explosion of traffic that all of them are seeing. And our team has just done an amazing job of reacting to that increase in demand. And we did that over the course of the last year, when it was even more critical. And we talked about this several times last year that our growth in IT-Datacom over the course of 2020. I think growing close to 50%, for example, sequentially in the second quarter, and reacting to this the literal explosion of data traffic resulting from all the video meetings and remote work and remote school and all of that. We made a lot of good friends in that market by stepping up and really enabling our customers when they needed us the most. At the same time, if anything we\u2019ve seen an acceleration in new product development, as our customers look to really push the limits of the bandwidth of their systems. And that involves new interconnect solutions that ultimately can enable that high speed, it involves new power solutions that can help the efficiency and there\u2019s so many dynamics that are going on across IT-Datacom all of which converge on the need for higher performance interconnect products. And whether that\u2019s web service providers and video over the internet, whether that\u2019s even like cryptocurrency and the processor power that\u2019s being used in support of the crypto market. I mean, these are all things that are just driving extraordinary demand for high speed and high efficiency, high speed interconnect and high efficiency power interconnect. And I can just tell you, our team working in both of those areas, has done a bang-up job to react to this to scale our capacity quickly in the face of really unexpected levels of demand. And this quarter was another example of that we certainly did not expect a 20% sequential growth, I think, we came into the quarter thinking kind of mid-single-digits and that that requires you to perform on that it requires you to have enough people and machines and automation and tooling and factory floor space and ready source of materials. And I think our team just did a great job of reacting in the moment here. Operator : Thank you. Now, our next question is from Chris Snyder of UBS. Sir, your line is now open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So industrial and auto have seen a pretty massive inflection in end market outgrowth over the last year or so. It sounds like there\u2019s not been much or if any supply chain talents here. So is this outgrowth in collection, it\u2019s driven by share gains or just an acceleration in the electronics revolution, so to speak. And if so, would we expect a structurally higher level of end market outgrowth relative to what we were seeing in the years leading up to COVID? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, I mean, look I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to look in the future, but for sure, over the course of the last year, and we shouldn\u2019t forget Q2 of last year was almost the nuclear winter for the automotive industry. But over the last year, our team working in industrial, working in automotive has clearly done an outstanding job of supporting customers when they needed us the most, and in certain cases doing that because some competitors could not rise to the occasion. So I think that there has been for us some outperformance relative to the industry. I think as well, we clearly have seen an acceleration of the adoption of electronics across the automotive industry, across the many, many segments of the industrial market, this kind of electronification of everything, if you will. And, it\u2019s not just EVs and it\u2019s not just batteries for those EVs. We\u2019re really seeing so many examples of traditionally mechanical fuel based hydraulic, converting to an electronic control, electronic functionality. And each time that happens, that\u2019s a new inflection point whereby if we can step in with the right types of interconnect products, the right types of sensors, leading edge products, if we can do that in a timely fashion, we can have it available for the customers when they need it, when they\u2019re seeing also an increase in their end demand that positions us very well. And so, I think, all of the factors that you mentioned have all come together in a very positive fashion to ultimately lead to us having the growth that we realized this quarter, as well as the positive outlook that we see in the third quarter, and I would hope also beyond. What does that mean for the long-term? Typically, the adoption of electronics is a one-way ratchet. It\u2019s not that people adopt a new electronic system, and then one-day go back to a mechanical system. That\u2019s not really how the evolution of electronics operates. And so, I think, long-term, it gives me some encouragement to see that there has been an acceleration and that kind of step function adoption of electronics, you would hope would continue to create the opportunities for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. Now our next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open. David Kelley : Hi, good afternoon, Adam and Craig. I always ask the automotive question, but the organic growth really stands out. So you referenced electrification as a driver, we\u2019re seeing EV auto sales really start to inflect and actually reach some scale now. Is there any way to quantify the contribution for you and then even taken a step back just more broadly in autos. Just curious, if you\u2019re seeing any customers start to build some inventories? You reference the below dealer inventory levels, so with some planning for the medium-term, just curious if you\u2019re seeing that in the market? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, I mean, look, I think the organic growth was pretty special, David. So I don\u2019t blame you for asking another automotive question. Again, I always say you can teach the master class here on automotive. But, yeah, 117% organic growth albeit to a quarter that was a pretty rough quarter a year-ago, but still it was really a very, very special performance. And our automotive team is very proud and justifiably proud of what they were able to achieve. I relative to the contribution of EV, I can tell you that, if you can imagine that the growth of EV was substantially higher than the growth that I just mentioned of that 117%. And without giving a specific amount of the total of our EV business, it\u2019s bigger than it used to be, and it\u2019s meaningful. It\u2019s a meaningful business. It clearly is an area of success for the company. And it\u2019s one that we look forward to realizing the benefits for many years to come. Relative to inventory, I would actually say that what we\u2019ve seen more of in the automotive market than stockpiling of inventory is we\u2019ve seen customers not wanting to take our product, because they all of a sudden can\u2019t get the appropriate semiconductor to finish the vehicle. And so we\u2019ve seen more, what I would call, push out of deliveries, as opposed to customers just throwing a bunch of stuff in their warehouses, now could there be some buildup of component inventory in certain places, there could be and we may not see it perfectly. But what we have seen for sure, and that went through the course of the quarter, is customers saying, well, we\u2019re going to have to shut down our factory for a couple of weeks. And that\u2019s we don\u2019t need your stuff right now. And we\u2019ve had to react quickly to that and that\u2019s actually meant that for us. We ended up with may be a little bit more of our own finished goods, a little bit more of our own work in progress than we would have liked in the course of the quarter. And still with that, we were able to achieve that 117% organic growth. So I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a big build up, there could be pockets of it, but the more obvious thing that we saw with the quarter where these push outs from customers, who couldn\u2019t get matching components to make the car. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Joseph Spak : Thank you. I too I\u2019m going to follow up on automotive, sorry. So it doesn\u2019t sound like you think inventory is a big issue, it did sound like you maybe took a little bit of share, and obviously it is helping. And I know even when compared to global production, your geographic exposure probably helped you a little bit, because of the larger recovery in North America and Europe. I guess, what I\u2019m \u2013 the other factor, I\u2019m wondering about is, is there a material content per vehicle difference between, let\u2019s call it, high value vehicles like a full-size truck and the lower value vehicle, because that can obviously also help and as we started thinking about next year maybe some of the volume recoveries more in those lower volume vehicles? Adam Norwitt : Yeah, well, Joe, again, no problem to get another auto question. I should say that you and David could probably co-teach the master class together. But look one maybe thing I would mention, you alluded to regional in automotive, and actually we saw really strong performance across all of the regions where we operate. And I would tell you actually that our business now regionally is more balanced than ever before is roughly equal size between Asia and Europe, and just to tick lower in North America. So that\u2019s quite a transformation. If you think about it over a decade, when at one point, our business was kind of two-thirds in Europe, and maybe a fifth in North America and the rest in Asia. So we\u2019ve made really great progress in Asia. And I would also say that in Asia, we\u2019ve made great progress also in the electrification in EVs, where our teams just done a fabulous job. Relative to your question do luxury cars have more content, for example, than a lower end car? I think the answer to that is absolutely, yes. That\u2019s always been the case, I think that will always be the case. But what are the differences that we have seen, and that\u2019s not just the difference of this year or last year, but maybe over the last kind of half a decade or so. As we have seen that more and more automakers are equipping their lower end cars with a greater degree of electronic functionality than they did in the past. The traditional approach for automakers to just stop their high-end cars with every possible feature to test out electronics in those cars to put the newest thing there first, and then maybe it would trickle down to the low-end more fleet-type cars, or maybe it wouldn\u2019t. But I tell you, you get any car of any size now and it\u2019s going to have features in it that you never would have imagined before even in like the smallest kind of Fiat 500 or something like that. You\u2019re going to see just a real array of electronics functionality. So, for sure, $100,000 car is always going to have more content as a $30,000 car. But I don\u2019t know that the intensity of electronics in that $100,000 is so many multiples more than it is on that maybe $30,000 car, in the past that would have been quite a different intensity of the electronic value in the car. So what does that mean for long-term? Our companies selling more high value trucks and luxury cars today, and maybe they\u2019ll sell more low value cars in the future that that I don\u2019t have a good read on, but I think there\u2019s electronics opportunities across all these types of cars. Operator : Thank you. Now our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thank you, and good afternoon, Adam and Craig. I guess, I have a more quick one, just trying to get a better handle on the difference between orders and your revenue guide for the next quarter. I mean, when I look at the difference now it\u2019s about $400 million last quarter, I think when you guided the difference was about $300 million. So just kind of wondering, is that more of a supply concern and securing supply? Or are you getting orders with longer lead times from your customers just kind of getting trying to get a better handle of what you\u2019re trying to bake in there, and if it\u2019s conservative at all. And then, I think in conjunction with that, I think one thing that I wanted to understand is broadly across your businesses. If you\u2019re just kind of feeling that the supply constraints are getting tougher, or are they getting easier to navigate at this point? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks, Samik. Well, first, I guess, maybe we have a little bit different numbers in automotive then what you mentioned, I think our automotive business at a 20% of sales that works out more than $0.5 billion in the quarter. And with the guidance that I\u2019ve given, it wouldn\u2019t be so dissimilar in the third quarter. So I\u2019m not sure the numbers that you referred to. Relative to supply constraints, are they getting better, worse, staying the same? I don\u2019t know. I guess, it feels about the same. I wouldn\u2019t say that it feels that much worse. And there are a few things that maybe do feel a little bit worse, like freight. The cost of freight is not that great. So the price of a container from Asia to the U.S. and, it\u2019s not that that\u2019s a huge impact on us. But once in a while you do that or your customer does that. And those have gotten quite a bit more expensive over the recent times, even just the availability of that. There\u2019s also been a few sorts of funky things that have happened, like there were some floods in Germany, which are really tragic. And we feel for the people of Germany that suffered through these, just sudden catastrophic floods. And there\u2019s a \u2013 Germany has a pretty decent sized electronics supply chain of vendors and various things like that. And we\u2019ve seen a disruption or two there. I talked about the COVID-related restrictions that are happening a little bit in Southeast Asia. So I don\u2019t know that I would say it\u2019s getting easier. That\u2019s for sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Luke Junk from Baird. Sir, your line is now open. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I had a big picture question this afternoon. And it\u2019s about the competitive landscape in your auto business. As we move into what\u2019s increasingly an EV world, you\u2019ve made, if we look over the last 10, 20 years great inroads growing in auto in what has been a combustion world, of course, where there are a lot of incumbent players. In a world where there are no true incumbents with respect to EV powertrains, how has that changed the competitive landscape for Amphenol, both in terms of your view of the opportunity set, and ultimately, how aggressively you pursue that business? Adam Norwitt : Well, I mean, the last part of your question I\u2019ll answer first, which is I think we\u2019ve pursued this business very aggressively over a long time period. We shouldn\u2019t forget that the whole concept of a high-voltage system in a car is not new. In fact, our teams have been working on development of specific automotive capable high-voltage interconnect systems for, I don\u2019t know, the whole time I\u2019ve been CEO. And I\u2019ve been CEO for nearly 13 years now. So I think that\u2019s not a new development. I don\u2019t think EVs are a new thing, hybrids aren\u2019t a new thing. But they\u2019re growing. And I think they\u2019re reaching \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you want to call it an inflection point. Someone mentioned that term earlier. But for sure, the adoption of these vehicles is accelerating on a global basis, even if they still represent a relatively modest proportion of the overall vehicle market. I mean, the vast majority of cars sold today are still combustion engine cars. But to your point, we have I think in EVs a proposition maybe that we didn\u2019t have in traditional automotive, which is that we\u2019ve been making high-voltage connectors for a very, very long time. I mean, if you think about the legacy of Amphenol over the nearly 9 decades that our company has been in business, we were early on a leader in the innovation and development of power interconnect that\u2019s used in military, aerospace, industrial applications. And that came with unique proprietary technologies, in particular around the efficient and safe transmission of high-voltage power across an interconnect system that requires a very unique contact technology that we have developed over many, many years. And so, early on, and when I say early on, this is a dozen years ago or more when we were really working early on in these hybrid electric vehicles, we were already repackaging our high-voltage interconnect technologies from the military and industrial into a more of an automotive type interconnect interface and otherwise. And so, that gave us a very strong position. So it\u2019s not new to us to be making high-voltage products. And to the extent that there are more traditional incumbents who are pure automotive companies, who may not have had that rich legacy of high-power, high-voltage interconnect, we could, on occasion, have an advantage. Granted they have an advantage with the breadth that they work in that market. So it\u2019s not that this is a kind of a clear path to world domination in the EV market. I mean, we have a lot of competition and we respect them a great deal. But if anything, I think our outperformance in automotive over many years, and in particular, over the recent years, there has been a not insignificant component of that, which has been us realizing the benefits of our position in high-voltage products. Operator : Excuse me, participants. Thank you for holding and sorry about the technical issue. We now have Mr. Craig Lampo online. Adam Norwitt : Hello, operator, do we have any more questions, please? Operator : Thank you for that, Mr. Lampo. As of now, we don\u2019t have any questions on queue. I will turn it back on to Amphenol for any closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Okay. Well, thank you very much. And we apologize everybody. There appears to have been a communications issue with the provider here. And we apologize if anybody did not, was not able to have their questions answered. Of course, you can feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team, to Craig and Sherri. But let me just take this moment to thank all of you again for your time here in this summer and we\u2019re very proud again of the company\u2019s results over the course of this second quarter. And we look forward to finishing the second half, also in the third quarter strongly as we go into 2021. And I want to take this opportunity also to wish each of you that you have a little bit of rest as the summer continues and come back recharged when we talk to each other 90 days from now. Thank you all so much and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today\u2019s conference call, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2021 conference call. Our third quarter 2021 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we'll take some questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2.818 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67 and $0.65 respectively. Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. Sequentially, sales are up 6% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and organically. Orders for the quarter were $3.016 billion, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020. And down 3% sequentially resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07:1. Breaking down sales into our two segments. The interconnect segment, which comprised 96% of sales, was up 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Our cable segment which comprised 4% of our sales was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter of 2021 adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS, which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels. From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021, which was equal to the third quarter of 2020 and increased from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. In the cable segment, margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% of third quarter of 2020 and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. Our margins in the cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and sudden increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage amidst many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high-performance action oriented culture. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.67 an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was at record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect primarily due to the higher than typical increase in inventory levels, driven by the continuous of challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days respectively. While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range. Inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reason just mentioned as well as the impact of recent acquisitions, which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 38% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 from $0.145 per share effective for payments beginning in January of 2022. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 million shares of company\u2019s of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73. And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $3.9 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand at $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS test and simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation. And therefore, its expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance. In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash tax and other acquisition related costs upon the divestiture of the test and simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations. I will now turn the call over to Adam who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and like to extend my welcome to everybody here on the phone today. And I hope that all of you had an enjoyable and healthy summer and are staying dry here if you're in the Northeast today. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally I'll make some comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2021. And of course we'll have time at the end for questions. As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales, as well as an adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies reaching a new record $2.818 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13% with broad-based growth across most of our served markets, as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Orders in the quarter were robust, again, more than $3 billion, $3.016 billion. And this represented another strong book-to-bill at 1.07:1. That despite the many operational challenges that we've continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures. We were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter. And as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement. Our EPS \u2013 adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65. And that's just an excellent reflection once again of our organizations continued strong execution. The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in the third quarter. And we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year. Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. These results once again reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization, as we continued to perform well, amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets. We're very pleased that the company broadened balanced and market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Very importantly, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual and markets, while also at the same time, exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both important benefits, especially amidst such a dynamic market environment. Turning first to the military market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in ordinance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales of products that were used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. Sequentially, sales declined by about 3%. Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect a slight sequential sales increase. And for the full year of 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol position in the military market as defense customers around the world continue to adopt next generation technologies at an increasing pace. Our industry leading breadth of high technology, interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs. And this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were flat compared to prior year and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. As expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially. Looking into the fourth quarter, we're happy that to now expect the mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels. And for the full year 2021, this would imply a roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this challenging environment so far our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane platforms and next generation systems integrated into those aircraft. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and in turn expand their procurement of our components. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. This excellent growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including in particular, the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels. But for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance. I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. Our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of the strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter. And despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. This strong performance reflected our automotive teams, excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. This was another clear confirmation of our global teams long-term efforts at designing and high voltage and other interconnect and sensor products into these next generation platforms. On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter, a high single digit sequential moderation in sales. For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year driven by our expanded position in next generation electronics integrated into cars, including in particular those electric and hybrid drive trains. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year\u2019s reduced sales levels, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5% as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smart phones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. Sequentially, sales increased by a stronger than expected 36% driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a continued mid to high single digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is in fact, an impressive achievement given last year\u2019s robust demand. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. With our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms enabling a broad range of next generation mobile devices. We're positioned well for the long term. Turning to mobile networks market. This market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales. As mobile networks customers continue to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next generation networks. And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%. Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology in datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. And this is driven by increased demand from OEMs and in particular increased demand from web service providers. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better than expected 10% from second quarter levels. As we look into the fourth quarter, we do expect a slight decline from these elevated levels. And for the full year of 2021, we expect sales to increase in the low 20% range. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT data datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. In turn, our team remained highly focused on enabling this continuing revolution and IT datacom with industry leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 5% from prior and 10% organically as cable operator procurement moderated. On a sequential basis, sales decreased by a slightly better than expected 3%. For the fourth quarter, we now expect a further moderation in sales from these levels and for the full year 2021, we anticipate that sales will grow in the mid single digits. Despite this more challenging environment in the broadband market, we continue to look forward to supporting our service provider customers around the world. All of them are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and to businesses. Now turning to our outlook. There's no question that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with significant supply chain and inflationary challenges, as well as the ongoing pandemic given this and assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. This would represent year-over-year sales growth of 11% to 13% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 11%. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $10.540 billion to $10.600 billion and full adjusted diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.41. This outlook represents full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 23% and 28% to 29% respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. Most importantly, I'd like to take this opportunity to once again, thank the entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Sir, you may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot and good afternoon. Adam, there's been a fair amount of talk, a lot of talk maybe around just supply chain challenges, inventory build and everything else. Yes, love to get your perspective, what are you seeing from that basis across your customer base? Are you starting to see your order the demand start to moderate a bit of customers being less eager to expedite orders or anything you're seeing variation between the channel and OEM demand trends? Just anything you see from that basis would be helpful. Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks very much, Amit. I mean, no doubt about it. A lot of chatter, a lot of news, you can't pick up the paper without reading about supply chains. I think for the first 22 years of my so far 23 year career, I don't recall that the front page was plastered with things about the supply chain. And now it seems to be virtually every day that you read something about it. And no question throughout the quarter, there remained just a number of real significant challenges that our team fought through and really fought through. I think when you see the results in particular growing sequentially by 6% in the quarter which was above our expectations, amidst, what I would say we are continued serious supply chain impediments, some of which even worsen throughout the quarter, whether that's availability of logistics and freight, the cost of raw materials, the availability of raw materials, even talking about things like labor shortages, which are there are pockets of that around the world as well. And so no question that those are all dynamics that our team faced and across that entrepreneurial Amphenol organization, our team just made it happen. Now in terms of inventory builds and orders moderating, I mean, we've still had strong orders in the quarter. There's no doubt about it. And even though our book-to-bill was a bit lower 1.07 compared to the second quarter, most of the reasons why our book-to-bill was lower because our sales grew into the level of the bookings. Orders were down by maybe 3% from the second quarter. But sales were up by 6% thus the slightly lower, but still robust book-to-bill. In terms of inventory, I mean, you saw for sure that our inventory was up a little bit and I think many have seen a little bit elevated inventory, which is not surprising given both our growth as a company, very significant growth, but also the very significant supply chain impediments that are out there. To the extent that our customers have more inventory. We don't always have perfect visibility into that. I will say what we do have visibility to, which is in particular in distribution, we haven't seen really abnormal levels of inventory amongst our distributor for our products. In fact, I think what we've seen is continued strong sell-through of the products into customers around the world. And knowing that our distribution business is predominantly industrial and aerospace [indiscernible] business, we've seen continued really strong demand in particular across the industrial market. What \u2013 in terms of the customers and their willingness to pull product, we talked about last quarter in the automotive market, for example, that we probably could have shipped more if customers wanted it. And I think we continue to see some instances anecdotes where customers, because they don\u2019t have all the components that they need to make their finished product be it a car or a truck or otherwise. They in the end don\u2019t take our product as opposed to necessarily building the inventory of our product. They just tell us not to ship it. So a lot going on, but I think at the end of the day, amidst all these challenges, the performance of the company has shown very brightly. Operator : And our next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Adam, I was wondering if you could just maybe touch on IT datacom a little bit more. It\u2019s been a very good year for that market for you guys. And after what seems like better expected quarters each quarter, you seem to sort of look for it to slowdown. So I\u2019m just curious, like where are you seeing maybe concerns, where are you seeing more opportunities, whether markets or share trends or new products, et cetera. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean no doubt about it. It\u2019s been a very, very strong year and I would almost say a very strong couple of years for our team work in the IT datacom market. I mean not forgetting that last year, we grew in that market by 15%. And this year, continuing to exceed our expectations with sales in this quarter in particular are growing by 28% and 10% sequentially. So no question about it. And I think when I look into the fourth quarter, we\u2019re coming from very elevated levels of demand. And we\u2019re not guiding to like a catastrophic reduction. We\u2019re talking about a modest sequential decline in the fourth quarter, which I think given the overall environment, given the overall demand from our customers and in particular customers in web service where we\u2019ve seen just really strong growth and whether you call them cloud or web service providers and we\u2019ve seen outstanding growth in that business over the last couple of years. And once in a while, you could have a moderation. There could even be a little bit of seasonality that could come into that. So I don\u2019t think that this fourth quarter guide is at all a turnaround in that business. It would still by the way in the fourth quarter reflect very, very strong year-over-year growth in that IT datacom market. And in the end, I think would be a very, very strong year for that market, for our teamwork in that market. Operator : And our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Adam, you guys have done a tremendous job maintaining profitability through so many difficult cycles. As you look at the cycle here, and through 2021, how much would you say your ability to raise prices has offset some of these inflationary pressures? And as you look into 2022, it sounded from some of the comments, especially in cable, that there was room to raise pricing some more to catch up. If you could just characterize sort of 2021, 2022 from ability to sort of recapture some of that, potential inflationary elements and how you think about it into 2022. That\u2019d be great. Thank you. Craig Lampo : Hey Wamsi, this is Craig. I think that if we think about our profitability, we\u2019re certainly very proud of our achievement in the quarter. And certainly, this year given the significant challenging costs environment. And certainly at that cost environment has been increasingly, I\u2019d say gotten worse over the course of the year. And I think that we have done a good job of neutralizing that worsening environment, given the actions we\u2019ve been able to take during the year. And one of those actions clearly is being able to pass on some of that cost to our customers, to the degree that we can offset it in other ways. And so certainly the management team, I think has done a really good job of that. Different markets are more challenging than other markets and certainly things like distribution is easier to pass on pricing and other markets are a little bit more difficult, our channels are difficult to impress on pricing. But I think overall, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job and most of the markets are passing on some of the pricing. I wouldn\u2019t make the exception and you comment on cable. And certainly that, that market is a different type of market from a competitive environment, as well as the products are a little bit different more \u2013 they\u2019re certainly more cost sensitive and certainly more impacted by logistics costs, which we\u2019ve seen a significant increase of. And there\u2019s been quite an quick increase of those types of costs that absolutely have had an impact that we haven\u2019t necessarily been able to offset at this point and the team\u2019s doing certainly a good job of working through that. And we do think over some period of time, they\u2019ll be able to offset those cost pressures, but that\u2019s something that in that market, you can\u2019t really do or in overnight, other markets, like automotive aren\u2019t so easy, but certainly I think the team\u2019s done a good job of starting those conversations and there\u2019s other markets that are easier. So I think that we\u2019ve done a good job. I think that we\u2019ve been able to offset the majority certainly of the sequential increases that we\u2019ve seen during the year of the cost environment. And we\u2019re not guiding into 2022 at this point, but I do believe that the cost environment is not going to get any easier any time soon. So the team certainly has been tasked with and I think they\u2019re doing a good job of continuing those conversations with their customers. And all of the markets, some of which are easier and some of which are harder. And in terms of being able to ultimately pass on those cost increases to our customers and to be able to continue to leverage and increase our margins as we continue to grow. Adam Norwitt : I would just add Wamsi to that one important principle here, pricing is an art, it\u2019s not just you issue a price increase and off it goes. And the beauty of how we\u2019re organized is that we\u2019re not making those pricing decisions here at headquarters, rather we have 125 general managers around the world, and those general managers are best suited to make the right decision around pricing, because they know the strength of their own position. They know their competitive position. They know their technology position. And they also can go to a customer and say, look, I have tried everything else. And the only remaining thing I can do is raise the price to you. And then it\u2019s a genuine, it\u2019s a reasonable discussion. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s grounded in fact, and basis as opposed to in corporate policy. And I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve always been maybe a little bit more successful in moderating the impacts of these, because our general managers have every tool available to them. All of the functions, all of the inputs are part of their responsibility. And thus, they\u2019re able to go out and make it happen. And just because the cost of materials is up, or the cost of logistics is up, it does not give absolution to an Amphenol general manager for their performance, not in our company. I mean no matter what the cycle is, we have absolute standards for performance and they have to hit that and they\u2019ll figure it out. And if that means, having those tough discussions with customers, then that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do. Operator : And our next question is from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Joe Cardoso : Thank you. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So broader question, I guess, the setup and guidance for 3Q seems there very similar to what we are seeing now for 4Q. However Amphenol was able to outperform the high end of the guide in terms of both revenue and earnings in 3Q. I guess can you help investors understand why they shouldn\u2019t expect a similar level of outperformance this time around, for example, are there headwinds around supply and costs intensifying or were there any materials surprises you would point out in 3Q that are not sustainable into 4Q? Any color around the puts and takes there as would be appreciated. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean, look, we always give guidance with the information at hand just as we did 90 days ago, we\u2019re doing here today. And so I wouldn\u2019t point to some different dynamic nor would I say that one should expect that we\u2019re going to be by the same amount that we beat last quarter. Our team is always going to strive to maximize our results, amidst, whatever environment we\u2019re in. And as we\u2019ve talked at nauseam, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment and they\u2019re going to continue to push, till the last minute of the last hour of the last day of the year in supporting our customers and executing amidst this environment. And if that ends up that we \u2013 that that this guidance is exceeded and that will be what it will be, but right now we\u2019re giving guidance based on what we see in the marketplace. Operator : And our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. William Stein : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Adam, I wanted to ask about lead times and expedites. It doesn\u2019t really sound like you\u2019re significantly stretched from a lead time perspective. So maybe you can provide some context, I\u2019m aware in every end market, every company within the Amphenol umbrella has different characteristics and so, an average might not be meaningful, but however you can describe the current lead time situation relative to how might\u2019ve been, let\u2019s say a quarter ago and versus what would be sort of a middle of the cycle sort of dynamic. And then the degree to which expedite requests might have change. There are some companies in the supply chain talking about the level or number of expedited parts falling significantly in the last quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing that same dynamic. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Will. I mean relative to our lead times, I mean, it should not be surprising that maybe we have a little bit of extra lead times now than we would have had a year ago. It is a very constrained environment. Sometimes even just getting materials in from overseas, if you need to have to do that, whatever there\u2019s just a lot of sort of sand in the gears of the global supply chain and that can lead to extra lead times. Also I\u2019ve talked about our orders, maybe not even because of our own lead times, but just customers opening up the aperture of their order window a little bit longer and that has led to some of the higher levels of orders that we\u2019ve seen in addition to just overall robust demand. As it relates to expedite requests, I don\u2019t know that I can give you a good read on that more thoroughly or systematically across the company. I mean we continue to have some customers who really need product. I mean to the extent that we are using a material that is really constrained, and there are certain cases of that, I continued to see the odd expedite request here and there. I don\u2019t know that I have a good read on whether it\u2019s less or more the same. I mean I guess I would say it\u2019s kind of the same over the last 90 days. Nothing that I would take note of really. Operator : And our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to get an update on what the company has seen in China both from a demand and an operational perspective. There\u2019s been a number of headlines around companies having a more difficult time operating in China things like electricity, shortages, certain materials constraints. And I\u2019m hoping you could elaborate on what Amphenol seeing there. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Mark, and good afternoon to you. I think one thing that I would just point out from this last quarter is actually our growth on a year-over-year basis was very balanced across all the geographies. I mean almost extremely balanced on an organic basis virtually every region grew by that, that 13% organically. And that, that was really nice to see actually a bit surprising given the sort of dynamics, whether they be pandemic related, supply chain related, electricity related or otherwise. And our team in China continues to do a fabulous job of managing through whatever challenges come their way and that did include in the quarter some challenges related to the availability of electricity. But fortunately for us, our approach operationally around the world, and that is the same approach that we have in China is never and not to put all our eggs in one basket. People are sometimes surprised that we have so many facilities around the world, something like 200, 250 facilities, and that includes something like 50 facilities in China that are spread across the country. And so when there are pockets of challenges over the last year and a half, whether that be from COVID-related shutdown, supply chain challenges, or even the electricity issues that you\u2019ve heard about in China, that\u2019s not having a material impact across the company, but rather may create a single challenge for one or another operation. And the local management team just makes it happen. And that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the approach that we take. Operator : And our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. You may go ahead. Nik Todorov : Yes. Thanks and congrats on great results. I have a question on auto. Adam, if you look at your auto numbers, it seems like they again outperform relative to peers. And you \u2013 I think you\u2019ve talked about seeing upside in the quarter relative to expectations. So why in your view, you continue to see upside in the quarter. Maybe going back to the expedite, do you continue to see expedites in auto? I\u2019m just curious because your lead times are relatively maybe they\u2019d be a little bit extended, but they\u2019re still nothing compared to what symptoms they saw and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t \u2013 you\u2019re not the one that are constraining the auto production. So why do you think you continue to see upside things? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Nik. Look, this is a long story for us, which is that we\u2019ve been growing our automotive business for more than a decade through a consistent strategy of growing both organically and through acquisitions, into new electronics applications, new applications in the car. Throughout the course of that time, we expanded our product offering from simple connectors and cable assemblies to sensors and antennas, complex center assemblies and the like. And through it all, our strategy has not been to just take share out of incumbents, but rather to participate in the expansion of electronics in the automotive market. And that expansion of electronics has really accelerated throughout that time. As I highlighted in my prepared remarks, one area of expansion for electronics has been across the electrification of vehicles, both electric and hybrid vehicles, where we've leveraged our strong legacy and high voltage capabilities to really be a strong participant in that area. And that's been a great growth driver for us for many quarters. And that included in the quarter that just completed. Have we seen expedites in the automotive market? I would actually say we've seen this quarter and last quarter more of the opposite of expedites. We've seen that customers have pushed out demand because of supply shortages that they're seeing from other types of commodities. You mentioned semiconductors as one example, as opposed to expedites that of customers pulling in. And \u2013 but for those other supply chain shortages, I'm sure automotive business would have been even more robust than it was. Operator : Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I've got another auto question. This one may be a little bigger picture. A lot of the discussion around your business these days is around EVs and rightly so. But what I wanted to ask you about is knock on effects that you're seeing on some other factors, some of the industry have talked about a so-called Tesla halo, i.e., the fact that consumer expectations for tech in the vehicle are just simply much higher in an EV. And I'm wondering as you look across your business and the growth that you're seeing, both right now and over the few years, how does this accelerated proliferation of technology inside the vehicle plates, the company strengths and positioning relative to electrification? Adam Norwitt : Well, look, it's a great question. And it's a question that I wouldn't even confine to EVs. I mean, you point out the consumer expectations for technology in EVs, but I would just say consumer expectations for technology in vehicles [indiscernible] has expanded and has continued to accelerate over many years. I mean, I just look at, my kids, when we get in a car, you've got like a spaghetti of cables that people want to plug in to various parts of the car. And then you now have car companies coming and putting in things like wireless charging and outlets in different places as opposed to. We having one of these massive things that every kid has to plug their thing into a cigarette lighter. Now everybody has their little connectors all over the car and things like that. And whether it'd be navigation systems, communication systems, safety systems, passenger comfort systems we have seen. And I think we are living through a revolution of electronics in vehicles and that's all vehicles because we shouldn't forget like in the global automotive market, I don't know, hybrid and EVs. I'm not perfectly familiar with every one of these numbers, but I think they still represent less than 10%. And that's if you include hybrid of all total vehicle volumes, but I would say all vehicles are adopting more electronics because the car companies have realized not only that their customers want these things, but actually they can make more money on these things. These type of features are things that people will actually pay more for and thereby allow the car companies to make more profit from their products and look, it's great news for anybody working in the automotive electronics market. It's \u2013 and for our company where again, our strategy has not been to go take share out of others, but rather to work on the new things that are happening in the car. I think our company comes out of that very well positioned. Operator : And our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. I just have one question and I don't know if it's for Craig or Adam, but either one is fine and that is on your cable products, operating margins, of course, raw materials of copper, aluminum, and all that have gone up. It sounds like you've mentioned you are putting in price increases, which is fair and good to hear, but the operating margins of below 4%, that's pretty what's the right word, unprecedented in a opportunity to see upside from there, as opposed to things about overall concern. So, do you think we're kind of at the lowest level here, or do you think they're going to be at these while \u2013 level of suppression for a while, but if you can just kind of talk about the profitability of that segment, because it seems like while a small part of a company overall, it is materially challenged right now, but I think there could be potential there. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks Jim. Yes, there's no doubt that the profitability of the cable segment is at the lowest level it's been in certainly in my memory. And I think, but when we talk about it being unprecedented, I think we're also in an unprecedented environment from a cost perspective. And especially as it relates to things that impact that segment, which are things like logistics and things like certain commodity costs that have always had a more of a significant impact on that segment. We've talked about commodities and cost environment impacting that segment more. And when you're in a more unprecedented environment where the costs have just increased so quickly and so significantly. And then you're in a market where it's not as easy to overnight increase prices, even in an precedent cost environment due to the competitive dynamics and other factors within those \u2013 within that market, that it just becomes an unfortunate situation that it does have a more significant impact in the short-term here. There's no doubt that the team is working hard on pricing actions, and we're confident that there will be successful over some period of time. Don't forget this is 4% of the company right now. It's relatively small, but for the businesses that are you involved in dealing with this that's \u2013 this is impactful for them as it is for any other operations. So it's not that it's not meaningful, but it certainly has a lower impact on the overall company, but there's no doubt as the new management team is extremely focused on this. We are optimistic that over some not so long-term period of time and this shorter term, we'll be able to get these margins back up. Whether or not it's next quarter or the quarter after, I think time will tell, but we are optimistic that it will. We are on the lower end of the scale in terms of profitability in this market. And it will improve over those coming quarters. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So I have another one on auto. I mean, the company was up over 20% organic against the backdrop of high teens declines and auto production. So very, very substantial levels of outgrowth. I understand all powertrains are seeing content gains, but this outgrowth inflection we've seen over the last year kind of really lines up with ramping EV production. So I guess the question is, would you guys be able to provide maybe what percentage of auto revenues are coming from high voltage today? So we could try to kind of see how that's lining up against EV units? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, we give a lot of details across the company. And I think we haven't publicly talked about the specific numbers of what makes up, what different powertrains make up, what different sales of our automotive market. But what we have said very consistently, and I would say it again this quarter is that the growth in our EV business, whether that's an auto or also our industrial electrification business have been significant drivers of our out-performance. So, you can imagine that after a number of quarters of doing so that business represents a lot more today than it did many quarters ago. And it's a meaningful piece of the business. It has a real impact on the business and it continues to have great potential for the future. Operator : Our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead. David Kelley : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if we could dig a bit deeper into the industrial strength. You noted growth across a number of your end market exposures there. So how should we think about the end market dynamics in some nation? And again, realizing there's a lot of puts and takes there versus Amphenol is kind of content opportunity and some of your market share gains. And then if I may, how should we think about some of the moderation and to your end, is there a specific end market where you expect to see that? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, David. I mean, you said it the industrial market is for us a very, very diversified range of segments. Now, everything from medical to heavy vehicles, to oil and gas, things like marine, factory automation that the battery and heavy electric vehicles, alternative energy. I mean, even an area like building automation where we've seen a lot of strong growth. I mean, what I think really unique here in the third quarter was virtually every one of those segments grew in the quarter. So, you don't always see that usually there's some sort of counter cyclicality across one or another of those segments, and we thought really strong performance across all of them. And when I think about why the company has really done such an excellent job in industrial, I mean, I'd point to a few factors. Number one is, our strategy for many years has been to build out a range of products that make us more important to customers across the industrial world. And again, remembering that what ties those products together is that they're all harsh environments solutions. So whether they be discreet connectors of value add interconnect assemblies center, antennas, or the like. These are all products that have to be ruggedized. They have to be fit to an environment that maybe as an ultra clean environment in an operating theater, or maybe an ultra dirty environment in an oil and gas drilling setup, or in an alternative energy on an offshore windmill or something like that. So all of these have just really uniquely challenging environments around them and what we see in common across these customers and where a lot of our growth has come from. This is really the second factor is that customers across the industrial market are adopting electronics at an increasing pace. So the same discussion that we add in the auto market, just a few moments ago, we see that really broadly across the industrial market as customers adopt next generation electronic systems and put those systems into tougher and tougher environments. I would also say that the industrial market is a very fragmented market from a competitive perspective. And so while for sure we're taking advantage of new things in this market like we are in automotive. I think there's also the fact that we continue to gain position against competitors who either don't have the breadth of offering, don't have the geographical position to support customers on a global basis. Don't have the diverse and resilient footprint that has been able to support those customers during the pandemic or during all the other disruptions that have come along and thereby customers have come increasingly to us to solve their problems, and we've not disappointed them. And that creates a positive feedback loop. So it's a market that I think we're very excited about. I think our team working in this market is just doing a great job. If you look into the fourth quarter for sure, you can look at that fourth quarter kind of through the prism of saying, well, we're guiding it to be down slightly. But in fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's going to be an outstanding fourth quarter as well. So, I think the team just continues to excel, and we're very excited about the industrial market for many years to come. Operator : And our next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen. You may go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hey, good afternoon guys. Adam, you've articulated your position in overall views of operating in China many times on these calls. But I don't want to give you the chance to do it again, just in light of the ramp ups intentions. And is it more challenging for companies to do business? Like I understand how you guys are positioned there. It clearly works. You have to on the margins, think about things slightly different as to how you deploy capital or how you do incremental \u2013 grow incrementally in a region like that. Is how increasing escalation here impacted the way you do things? Adam Norwitt : Well, look, I mean, we're not blind to the world around us. So there's no doubt about it. I mean, the geopolitical tension that has been present for a number of years has certainly not gone away. And for one [ph] would fully advocate that countries like the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies should for sure get along. There's lots and lots of reasons why we shouldn't. By the way, firstly, I'm very optimistic that long term that is going to be the case. But as it relates to our position in any country, including China, I mean, I would just remind everybody, we have a very unique operating strategy. We rely on local managers in every country that we operate and we operate in more than 40 countries around the world. And in each of those places, we have local general managers who have the authority to run their business as they need to run it in that region to be most successful. And so our general managers in China are able to tailor make how they do business, obviously within the confines of ethics and law and everything that it means to be a global company. But they're able to meet their customers on a level playing field with their local competitors. But in fact, it's not a level playing field, because then they're able to bring the totality of Amphenol capabilities to bear in support of those customers. And that's where the advantages is. We bring the best of both worlds of both being a local partner, but also a global company who has global resources, global breadth and global capabilities. And that's why we've been successful in India. That's why we've been successful in China. That's why we've been successful in France, in Germany and the UK. And of course here in the U.S. It's a very unique operating model that is, that works really, really well in a world where everybody's getting along, but it also works really well in a world where people aren't necessarily getting along. In terms of how we deploy our capital, we're always careful about deploying capital in every country in the world. We're always going to incorporate all the sort of risks and opportunities into our calculus about what we're going to invest in and what we're not going to invest in. And ultimately those investment ideas are all coming up from below, not sort of dictated from above. But for sure, we're going to apply appropriate scrutiny to investments in every place in the world, using sort of the full picture of the environment into which we're investing. Operator : And our last question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thanks Adam. I just to follow on one more on China. Are you seeing any impact either direct or indirect from some of the power shortages that that have been going on and how's that impacting the business? Adam Norwitt : Thanks Joe very much. Look, I think we've seen a lot of challenges and I talked a little bit about this earlier. But \u2013 and those challenges have included in China, a few power shortages. But I think like I described, luckily for us, our approach is to not put all our eggs in one manufacturing basket. And so while we've had maybe an odd power shortage in one location or another. It hasn't had a meaningful impact on the company. And our local team is doing a fabulous job of mitigating any impact that there could be of such shortages. It gives everybody something else to think about in a time where there's a lot going on. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much. And I'd like to just extend my best wishes to everyone here on the phone. Thank you so much for taking the time with us. And we will talk to you after the holiday season. So I will be the first to wish everybody a happy holiday season and a happy and successful end of the year. And we'll talk to you in 2022. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded, if anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2021 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give you an overview of the business as well as current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call will be on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. The company closed the fourth quarter with record sales of $3.027 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.72 and $0.70, respectively. We are very proud that the fourth quarter represents the first time in Amphenol's history that we achieved quarterly sales in excess of $3 billion. Fourth quarter sales were up 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies and up 18% organically. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the significant sales increase was primarily driven by the robust growth in the IT, data communications, industrial, mobile networks, commercial air, automotive and broadband markets, including contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars and organically and 8% in local currencies. For the full year 2021, sales were a record $10.876 billion which were up 26% in U.S. dollars, 25% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to 2020. Orders for the quarter were $3.278 billion, which is up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.08:1. Breaking down fourth quarter sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment, which comprise 96% of our sales, was up 25% in U.S. dollars, while the Cable segment was up 22% in U.S. dollars. Breaking down full year sales into our two segments. The Interconnect segment was up 27% in U.S. dollars and the Cable segment was up 21% in U.S. dollars. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $593 million and $608 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021 and GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the Q4 of 2020 and by 70 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter 2021 GAAP operating income includes $15 million of acquisition-related costs related to the Halo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter. Excluding these costs, the fourth quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin was 20.1%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and by 20 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021.  The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with a slight margin dilution of acquisitions, and these impacts were partially offset by the normal operating leverage on higher sales levels as well as the lower negative cost impacts from the pandemic. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin was due to the continued challenging commodity and supply chain environment, which has not yet been fully offset by pricing and other actions. For the full year 2021, GAAP operating margin was 19.4% and adjusted operating margin was 20%. The 80 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the lower negative cost impacts resulting from the pandemic, and these benefits were partially offset by the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021 as well as the current margin dilutive effect of the acquisitions we made during the year. From a segment standpoint, operating margin in the Interconnect segment was 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021, and operating margin in the Cable segment was 2.4%. Our margins in the Cable segment continued to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and significant increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through all of these many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster high-performance, action-oriented culture. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.8%, which compared to 21.7% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively. The slightly lower adjusted tax rate in the quarter reflected the year-to-date true-up of a full year adjusted effective tax rate from the expected 24.5% to a slightly lower 24.3% a result -- as a result of a slightly more favorable mix of income for the full year. For the full year 2021, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.6% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.3%, which compared to 20.5% and 24.5% in 2020, respectively. In 2022, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.72 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26% compared to $0.57 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS was also a record $0.70, an increase of 23% compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $2.51, a 28% increase from $1.96 in 2020 and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.48 in 2021, an increase of 33% compared to 2020. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company faced in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $464 million or 106% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending -- our free cash flow was also a record $379 million or 87% of adjusted net income. For the full year, 2021 operating cash flow was $1.524 billion or 98% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2021 was $1.167 billion or 75% of adjusted net income. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80, 71, 56 days, respectively all of which were within our normal range, and we are especially pleased that our team's focus on all elements of working capital management, which resulted in a significant reduction of the company's inventory days from the third quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $81, bringing total repurchases during 2021 to 9.3 million shares or $662 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2021 was more than $1 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. For the quarter and full year 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $726 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. And at the end of 2021, our net leverage ratio was 1.4x. Lastly, as noted in the press release, effective January 1, 2022, we have aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. We will report results for these new segments as well as comparable historical financial data starting in the first quarter of 2022. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to also extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And hopefully, it's not too late for me to wish you and your family is all a happy new year. I also want to just express my wishes that everybody here on the call together with your family, your friends and your colleagues are all managing to stay safe and healthy, in particular, amidst the Omicron wave that's occurring in many areas of the country. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our fourth quarter and, in particular, our full year achievements. I'll discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then I'll make a few comments on our outlook in the first quarter. And of course, we'll have time for Q&A thereafter. With respect to the fourth quarter, we're truly proud to have finished the year with record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, both of which were significantly above the guidance that we gave just 90 days ago. Sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and in local currencies reaching a new record of $3.27 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, driven in particular by robust growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, industrial and automotive end markets. And I'll talk to each of those markets here in a moment. The company booked a record $3.278 billion in orders in the fourth quarter which represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.08:1. Despite the many operational challenges we and others continue to face, including ongoing cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other pressures, our adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached a very strong 20.1%. Adjusted diluted EPS was a new record $0.70 and represented a robust growth of 23% from prior year, an excellent demonstration of our organization's continued strong execution. And as Craig mentioned, we generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $464 million and $379 million, respectively, both of which are clear reflection of the quality of the company's earnings. Just at the end of this quarter, I'm extremely proud of our team. As these quarter's results once again reflect the discipline and the agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well amidst a very challenging environment. We're also very pleased that in the quarter, we announced on December 1, the acquisition of Halo Technology Limited for a purchase price of approximately $715 million. Halo is a leading provider of active and passive fiber optic interconnect components for the communications infrastructure markets with expected sales this year of approximately $250 million. Halo's product offerings are highly complementary to our existing high-speed and fiber optic Interconnect solutions and represent a significant long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol, in particular with customers in our IT datacom, mobile networks and broadband markets. We're especially excited that Halo significantly bolsters our position in active fiber optic Interconnect products, which is a technology with truly high-growth potential as customers around the world are upgrading their networks to support the acceleration of high-speed data traffic. Halo is an agile supplier of these important products to a wide variety of customers across these communications infrastructure markets, whose unique technology and service offering enables them to realize strong operating results. I'm just very excited to welcome the highly talented and entrepreneurial Halo team to the Amphenol family and look forward to great things from them in the future. We also announced on December 1, the closing of the sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business to Illinois Tool Works or ITW. We remain extremely pleased with the entirety of the MTS acquisition, which as you all recall, was announced last year in the fourth quarter, meaning 2020.  With the disposition of Test & Simulation to ITW, we have now acquired 1 of the leading sensor companies in the industry, further strengthening our broad offering of high-technology sensors. We're very proud of the performance of the MTS sensors team during their first 3 quarters as part of the Amphenol family, and we look forward to them driving outstanding value for many years to come. I remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. And in fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the full year of 2021. I can just say it was an extremely successful year for Amphenol despite the many operational and cost challenges that we faced. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically reaching a new sales record of $10.876 billion. I would just note that, in fact, over the past 2 years, both of which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we've grown our sales by more than 32% from our 2019 levels, which is a great confirmation of the value of the company's diversification and the agility of our management team in every environment. Our full year 2021 adjusted operating margins reached 20%, which was an increase of 80 basis points from last year from 2020 despite the multiple pressures on margins that we experienced around the world. And this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.48. We generated operating and free cash flow of $1.524 billion and $1.167 billion, respectively, again, excellent confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. We also put that cash to work with our acquisition program that created great value in 2021 with 7 new companies added to the Amphenol family. MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, LCAB, Unlimited Services, CableCon and Euromicron, have collectively expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family and thereby strengthening our organization. We're excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. In addition, as Craig noted, in 2021, we bought back over 9.3 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 38% representing a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1 billion for the year. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility in the overall environment in 2021, as we enter 2022, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now let me turn to the performance of the company across our served markets. And I would just note that we remain very pleased that the company's balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2021, and that market, industrial being really one of our most diversified markets across the segments within industrial. We believe that this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets while continuing to expose us to the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Now turning to the military market. Military represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales grew from prior year by 6% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales did moderate by about 4% driven by reduced sales related to airframe applications and ground vehicles. Sequentially, our sales increased slightly as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full year 2021, sales to the military market grew by 13% in U.S. dollars and 4% organically, reflecting our leading market position and strong execution across virtually all segments of the military market, together with the benefits of the MTS Sensors and Positronic acquisitions completed earlier in the year. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase slightly from these fourth quarter levels, and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the military market. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next-generation technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the fourth quarter and as well for the full year of 2021. Sales in the quarter grew 27% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as we benefited from the beginnings of a recovery in procurement to support growing aircraft production as well as from the contributions from our recent acquisitions. Sequentially we're very pleased that our sales grew a robust 15% from the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year, sales declined by 10%, reflecting the significant impact of the ongoing pandemic on travel and aircraft production. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels. Regardless of the challenges in the com air market in both 2020 and 2021, our team working in this market remains very committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes. As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and, in turn, their procurement of our products. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and sales in this market significantly exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter increasing by a very strong 42% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically from prior year. We experienced robust strength in essentially all segments of the industrial market with particular strength in battery and heavy electric vehicle, transportation, rail mass transit, factory automation, heavy equipment as well as oil and gas. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 2%, which was significantly better than our expectation for a sequential moderation as we saw broad-based strength. For the full year 2021, sales in the industrial market grew by a very strong 46% in U.S. dollars and 27% organically as we saw again broad-based growth across virtually all market segments of the global industrial market. Looking to the first quarter of 2022, we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these very strong fourth quarter sales levels. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology Interconnect Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically as well as through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year 2021. Sales in automotive were actually much stronger than we had anticipated coming into the quarter, with revenue growing by a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically versus prior year, and this was driven particularly by strength of our sales in the hybrid and electric vehicle applications as well as our sales to customers in Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by a very strong 10%, well above our prior expectations for a high single-digit decline as we saw strong demand from customers in anticipation of improving production volumes in the first quarter. For the full year 2021, our sales to the automotive market increased by a strong 47% in U.S. dollars and 41% organically, reflecting the continued recovery of the automotive market as well as our expanded position in next-generation electronics integrated into cars, including, in particular, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into the first quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation in sales from these very lofty levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has demonstrated an incredible degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from the reduced sales levels in 2020, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that struck the entire automotive industry during the course of this year. We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. The mobile devices market represented 14% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12% of our sales for the full year of 2021. Our sales to mobile device customers declined from prior year by 5% and in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as declines in products incorporated into smartphones more than offset the growth that we did realize in wearable devices, laptops and tablets. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 14%, driven by higher sales to smartphones and wearable devices. For the full year 2021, sales in the mobile devices market increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically as we benefited from growth in our products used in laptops and wearables, offset in part by a moderation of sales related to smartphones and tablets which, as you will recall, were particularly strong during 2020 with all of the work from home and study from home dynamics that were there early on in the pandemic. Looking into the first quarter, we anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain 1 of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continue to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and for the full year. And we're very pleased that sales in mobile networks increased from prior year by a very strong 36% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically. And this was with growth, particularly from our sales to mobile network operators in support of their next-generation 5G network buildouts. Sequentially, our sales increased by a higher-than-expected 7%. For the full year 2021, our sales to the mobile networks market grew by 12% from prior year and 7% organically. Looking into the first quarter of 2022, we do expect sales to moderate from these very strong levels. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our long-term efforts at expanding our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  As customers continue to ramp up their investments into these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers.  The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 21% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter in IT Datacom were much stronger than expected, rising by 53% in U.S. dollars and 49% organically from prior year as we benefited from broad-based demand for our industry-leading high-speed power and fiber optics solutions. While we saw strength really across server, networking and storage applications, we experienced especially robust growth from web service providers and other data center operators in the quarter. Sequentially, our sales grew by 10%, which was significantly higher than our expectations, which had been coming into the quarter of a slight decline. We do believe our sales growth benefited from some modest pull-in of demand from the first quarter as customers prepared for potential supply chain issues related to Chinese New Year. For the full year 2021, our sales to the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically as we continue to benefit from our strong technology solutions and leading position across a broad array of applications. Again, sales to web service providers were a significant contributor to our full year growth in 2021.  Looking ahead, we do expect a high single-digit moderation in the first quarter, reflecting the very robust demand in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we're excited by our strengthened technology position especially with the addition of Halo's active and passive fiber optic interconnect products. I remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our OEM and service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the continued dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the full year, sales increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically from prior year as we benefited from increased spending by cable operators as well as the contributions from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a better-than-expected 10%. For the full year 2021, sales to the broadband market grew by 9% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Looking ahead, we expect sales to increase in the low double digits from these levels as we benefit from the addition of Halo's product sales into the broadband market. We remain encouraged by the company's position with broadband customers and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to both homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current market environment, no doubt, remains highly uncertain with significant continuing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as the impact of the ongoing pandemic assuming that conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.690 billion to $2.750 billion as well as adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61. This guidance represents very strong sales growth over prior year of 13% to 16% as well as adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 17% compared to the first quarter of last year. Finally, I just want to note, as we described in our press release, effective January 1 of this year, we have aligned our business units into 3 newly formed divisions, Harsh Environment Solutions, Communication Solutions and Interconnect and Sensor Systems. This new alignment will allow us to further scale our business beyond the $10 billion sales level that we crossed last year. Very importantly, this alignment further strengthens our unique and strong Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship, while reinforcing the accountability of our 130 general managers around the world. We look forward to providing more detail -- financial detail about these reportable segments at the time of our April earnings release. I come away from this quarter still so confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the continued challenges in the marketplace and to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And most importantly, I'd just like to close by taking this opportunity to once again thank the entire Amphenol team. In particular, I'd like to extend my thanks to all of our factory workers around the world. While many of us have been able to work from home on occasion during these last two pandemic impacted years, I'm just so inspired by the dedication of our factory workers who never worked a single day at home and it was just a phenomenal thing to see. And the results that we saw in the fourth quarter really are a great credit to their and our entire Amphenol organization's dedication. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Adam, as I think about the demand vectors that you're seeing, there's obviously some worry out there that you might be over shipping versus end demand in some big rate. If I think about 24% growth in December, your guide is implying a very healthy 14%, 15% growth in March. I think your compare is actually difficult. I'd love to get any perspective you have in terms of the growth that you're seeing, if it's truly end demand or you think there's a bit of an inventory build happening at the customer level and then maybe as a way to think about this in terms of your growth vectors direct versus the channel, that would be helpful, too. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Amit, and happy New Year. Look, we don't have a perfect visibility into, as you know, our OEM customers and their warehouses and how much inventory they're holding. But there's no doubt about it that across the electronics industry, and I guess, across really all industries, customers have probably gotten a little more gun shy because of supply chain challenges. At the same time, I can tell you there's robust demand. And I think if you take a market like the automotive industry, as one example, try to go out and buy a car today, it's not an easy thing. I know Craig went out and recently bought a car, and he shared with me that there was nothing to buy. And the choices that one has when one is willing and ready to go out and buy something is just not there still today. And so whether there is a mismatch of components that ultimately is creating difficulty for our end customers to ship things and that can create some challenges across their supply chain. That may very well be. But the end demand by end consumers for things like cars, for things like semiconductors, for things like high-speed data this end demand still seems relatively robust. As it relates to the channel, as you know, very well, distribution represents for us. I think this year, it was about 17 or so percent of our sales, which was a little tick up from years past, and it was 15%, 16%. And we saw very strong demand from distribution through the course of the year. And I wouldn't say that we've seen any inventory build. To the contrary, I would say that probably inventories are a little bit lighter inside distribution, reflecting the strength of the pull-through of demand. What does that mean here going into the first quarter? No doubt about it. There remains a lot of volatility. There remain a lot of supply chain challenges. But I'm sure that whatever comes along, our team is going to be very agile and nimble to jump on any opportunities to ship products like we were in the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matthew Sheerin : Yes, thank you. And good afternoon. Adam, I just wanted to talk about the upside that you saw across several end markets at a time when a lot of your peers are even missing numbers or talking about big revenue opportunities that they missed as a result. And I'm wondering whether Amphenol's unique operating model when you've got many operating units running on their own, does that put you at an advantage in a market like this? And then just as a follow-up, regarding your inventory reduction, are you expecting to build in some markets because of their supply chain issues? Adam Norwitt : Well, Matt, thank you very much. I mean this is a question that, as you know, is very close to my heart. I mean the simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe that our unique operating model creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace because of the agility the reactivity and the flexibility that it instills at every level of the company. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have taken this step effective January 1 of creating the three operating divisions of the company. And the purpose of this is to ensure the long-term scalability of that unique operating model, making sure that every one of our 130 general managers around the world has reports to somebody who has the bandwidth to support them in every way that we need to drive collaboration, to stimulate them to exceed beyond levels that they ever thought they could do and that is really the magic of the Amphenol operating model. When I joined the company 23 years ago, we were just some general managers reporting to our then CEO, Martin Loffler. And it was -- when we were about to reach $2 billion in sales that we created the first concept of a grouping of those general managers, again, to ensure the appropriate span of control, the appropriate attention and the stimulation of all of the value that comes from inside the company. And that group model, we eventually became seven operating groups. And as we have evolved, it became very clear that to continue fostering that unique operating model, we needed to create more operating groups, and I can't have 12 of them reporting to me, and that's why we create now this concept of the divisions. But at the end of the day, all of our jobs is to enable those 130 general managers around the world because that is ultimately what makes this company special. And why we're able to succeed in really good times and bad and in particular, in volatile times like today. In terms of inventory, I mean I think we're very proud of the work of our team and actually reducing our inventory in the fourth quarter, even with a 7% sequential increase in sales and bringing our inventory days basically to a normal level at the end of the year in a time period where there's so much supply chain chaos. And you can imagine in the first quarter that maybe days would go up with the sequential sales that we have guided. But this is a phenomenal reflection of the fact that these 130 general managers, they're not just responsible for sales. They're not just responsible for gross margin. They're responsible for the entirety of their businesses. Every line item of the P&L, every line item of the cash flow, every line item of the balance sheet, and that allows them to really perform in challenging times like today. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'm more -- I'm looking back and you've typically also provided some color on the full year expectations in the past. And you -- maybe if you can comment on the thinking behind not providing a full year guide? And if you can share how you're thinking about the sustainability of the growth rate that you have in 1Q through the remainder of the year and any thoughts on margins. Just to give us some guide points about how to think about the year? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, very simply put, we remain in a once in a centric global pandemic. I know we here live in Connecticut, where we've just gone through the Omicron wave, that Omicron wave is probably going to other places around the world, including places in which we manufacture products, and it doesn't seem prudent at this point to try to get out ahead of our skis on guessing a pandemic is going to strike and could potentially impact our customers anywhere in the world. And in such an environment, we don't think it's prudent to give guidance beyond the quarter that we've given, and that includes guidance on margins, on sales by market and all the other aspects Operator : The next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. William Stein : Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the very good results and outlook. I have a question about the new segments and operating structure that you highlighted. Adam, you -- several years ago, you sort of forecasted this to some degree you said that at some point you might need to add a new layer of management. So now we're seeing it. But the question I have is about how this compares to the current organization and, in particular, the current end markets. Will we still have the same end market disclosure at least on the earnings call? And will those in fact, roll up to segments so that we can use want to forecast the other? Or are these sort of orthogonal cuts at revenue? And maybe along with that, from a management perspective, remind us, did the end markets have business leaders one per end market? Or is that just -- is the end market discussion more for our understanding and analysis and not the way the company is managed internally. Sorry for the compound question, but thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, number one, you have a memory like a steel trap as always. And #2, I think you essentially answered your question in certain ways here. Look, we organized our company not by market. And so our 130 general managers are each responsible for a certain distinct type of product across the extraordinary array of products that we see in the interconnect, as we define broadly interconnect products from connectors to value-add cable assemblies, printed circuit assemblies to sensors, to antennas and just the tens and tens and tens of thousands of different types of products that we make. And ultimately, because our general managers are responsible for manufacturing and design and quality and everything, it is really a product focus that each of them have. And as you know, we've talked for many years that one of our strategies that has been so successful is the way that we diversify the company is we design products maybe initially for a customer in a certain market. But then we work very aggressively and collaboratively across the company to proliferate that product across all markets that we can see. So an example is high-speed products. Originally high-speed products were developed for IT applications, for things like core routers and the like. But as high-speed data starts to proliferate into other areas, for example, a fighter jet. Now our team in high speed would work collaboratively with the team who is maybe more focused in the defense market to make sure that we're creating the broadest product offering for those customers.  And so what that ends up meaning is that many of our general managers work across multiple markets. Some of them are focused, some are not, depending on the type of product. And at the end of the day, the divisions that we now will report as reportable segments, they will each sell into multiple of our markets and the markets won't map to the divisions as it were. But we'll provide disclosure on what markets are in which division, but you're going to end up finding that most of our markets are serviced by all three of those divisions. Craig Lampo : Yes. And we'll continue to guide by end market as we have done historically. We will not be guiding by division, but we will be giving similar to we give today, financial information, revenue income information at the segment level. And so -- but nothing will change from a guidance perspective in terms of how we talk about guidance. Adam Norwitt : And we're not going to change the transparency that we give to all of you with all of our end markets. Operator : The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping you could talk a bit about how to think through conversion margins at the EBIT level going forward. Very understandably, you mentioned a few headwinds in terms of M&A and supply chain that impacted the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. So I'm curious if you should think it's possible you have better than typical conversion margins this year as you have more opportunity to offset some of those challenges and some maybe above the historical conversion margin levels for 2022? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Mark. No, no doubt. I mean I just wanted to start with just saying that we really are actually proud of kind of what we achieved here and for the full year 2021 and for the fourth quarter being at 20.1% and 20% for the full year amidst a really challenging year from a cost and supply chain perspective. The team really did a, I think, outstanding job of kind of navigating that as the year really continued to progressively get worse in regards to just the underlying costs that the organization was seeing and to be able to kind of navigate that through pricing and other actions. I think that the team did a pretty outstanding job of doing that, which has ultimately resulted in the results we have today. As we look into the first quarter, kind of implied in our guidance, I know we don't per se talk about or guide to specific EBIT numbers. But our implied guidance would reflect actually some level of progress made in the first quarter in regards to pricing and other actions so that -- and where you could see that really is kind of the sequential conversion, typically on a lower revenue level, especially going from Q4 to Q1, where we have high single-digit, 10% sequential reduction in revenue, we would see typically kind of high 20s, even 30% kind of negative conversions. And in this implied guide, there's closer to kind of mid 20s sequential conversion. That's even including some negative impact from a conversion perspective related to Halo in regards to because they're around our company average, but that necessarily bring with the normal conversion level. So I think from that perspective, we are seeing some positive momentum as we move into the first quarter. And I don't think I'll talk past the first quarter at this point. Obviously, the team continues to work hard at improving the bottom line and kind of we'll see what happens with the underlying environment as well. But I am confident as we saw in 2021 that the team has done a good job, and we'll continue to do, I think, a very good job of navigating this very difficult environment. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Adam, Craig, you both mentioned commodity and logistics costs several times. And you noted that you're taking ongoing price actions. When do you expect these actions to fully offset? I guess, Craig mentioned partly in 1Q, you are making progress. But if these costs stayed relatively fixed, let's say, given the price action that you've taken across your portfolio, when should we think that you would be able to mitigate the entire amount?  And secondarily, would you say that these pricing actions that you've taken are broad-based across the entire portfolio? Are there areas like auto, which typically take longer to have price discussion and price increases filtered through sort of behind the curve? And maybe if you could just characterize Adam, like what percent of the portfolio maybe have seen price increases? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Thanks, Wamsi. I think in regards to when our pricing actions could fully offset, I mean, this is kind of a theoretical question because it's difficult to say ultimately what's going to happen to the underlying environment. I think to assume that the underlying environment is going to stay exactly where it is today is a little bit unrealistic. So whether or not it gets better or gets worse. But I could tell you that, again, as I mentioned a minute ago that the team is doing I think a good job, and we are starting to see progress here in the first quarter. So I'm not really sure I can tell you exactly when that would be. But I would tell you that we are confident that based on some of the progress we're starting to make here in the first quarter that we're starting to make some headway on it given the current environment. But we're sitting here again in continuing pandemic, continuing into economic environment that's a bit uncertain. So for me to kind of try to predict when we're going to completely offset the current cost environment is just not something that I guess they're prepared to do. Adam Norwitt : And then, Wamsi, relative to our pricing strategy and every customer, every market, every region, every circumstance is different. Pricing is an art, it's not a science. You can bet that every one of our 130 general managers has this at the forefront of their mind. We also know that we -- there are some markets where it's easier to raise price, for example, in distribution, you just sort of announced a price list increase. And there are others where it's more challenging and where you have maybe longer-term contracts or where there's just not -- people are not accustomed to the concept. And so there's a real process of educating customers of being transparent with them and ultimately bringing them around to the understanding that what you're talking to them about is reasonable and especially that it's reasonable in light of your company's steadfast support for them, which is something where I think we stand on very solid ground. We were there for our customers through the pandemic. We were there for them when maybe others were not through the supply chain crisis. And so that -- all things being equal, should position us well to be able to ask nicely of our customers that, that would -- that they should share in that. Also our markets have a lot of different time cycles to them. Some of them are very short-cycle markets where there's really no price change. Others are longer cycle markets. To give you a percent of all where we've been able to achieve pricing, I couldn't even do it. We don't have 1 computer system that can sort of push a button and split that out. But I think we're having increasing success, Craig alluded to that as well. It's a hard job, it's a job that is ultimately the responsibility of our general managers who are best positioned to know what costs are going up and then who themselves sit in front of the customers and have those very difficult negotiations. I think we're going to continue to make good progress over the course of this year, when ultimately we fully offset it, as Craig said, is a theoretical question, that's not so easy for us to answer. Operator : The next question is from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. You may go ahead. Nikolay Todorov : Thanks. I appreciate it. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry, another pricing question maybe for Craig. Craig, is there a way to break for us the headwind from supply chain versus M&A in 2021 as because 2021 was pretty busy for you from an M&A perspective for you? Craig Lampo : Yes. I mean I would say that if you look at our kind of overall conversion for 2021, it was probably actually pretty close to what our target is on an organic basis. That's -- we had some benefit from some pandemic costs offset by some supply chain-related costs. And then kind of the difference that is related to our acquisitions, which did bring with them at least currently a lower operating margin, which over time, we believe that we should be able to get up to the company average. So I think that's the way to think about it. I think that again, we're very proud of the ability to really actually Adam alluded to our 2-year increase in revenue over kind of through a pandemic in the supply chain, we call crisis and of over 32%. And the reality is, actually, our EPS, our earnings actually increased by that -- roughly that same amount a little bit even higher than that slightly.  So I think that typically, we want to have a slightly higher EPS increase. And I think that given the fact that we've done a really good job of kind of offsetting some of these costs, I think, ultimately, we were able to really continue to increase our earnings over that 2-year period at a rate that's slightly under that we would have hoped from an organic perspective, but actually very, I think, respectable and very actually I'm very proud of considering all the costs that existed over the last couple of years here. Operator : The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess I was just wondering, respectfully, looking at the last few quarters, the company has sort of look for a moderation in industrial and IT datacom and it's continued to perform a lot better than you guys were thinking and now you're sort of calling for the same thing again. Just stepping back and looking at the past versus going forward, is there anything different in your thinking now that you're seeing in the markets or just still trying to be conservative and any other risks you would point out that maybe we should appreciate? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Steven. Good afternoon to you. And no disrespect at all taken. I think it's a very good question. Look, we come into every quarter in this very uncertain and relatively volatile environment and try to give you and our entire investor base the best assessment that we can give on the basis of what we're hearing from our customers and on the basis of how -- what we're seeing in the supply chain and our operations and all of that. And I think we have outperformed in industrial and IT datacom. And we were really pleasantly surprised last quarter. I mean this is a very significant outperformance that we achieved here in the fourth quarter. I think maybe a little bit less outperformance, but still very strong in the third quarter. Are we going to outperform what we've guided in the first quarter in IT datacom and industrial? I'm not going to say that right now, but you can imagine our team is a very hungry team, who really takes a real make-it-happen attitude and tries to do everything we can. And ultimately, their goal is not just to maximize revenues so that we can report higher revenues, but their goal is to make sure that we're there for our customers when they need us. And in particular, we're there for our customers when others are not there for them because we believe that these two years have really created an opportunity for us to solidify our position with customers in a way that we actually weren't able to do prior to this real crisis over these last two years.  And so whenever we hear from a customer that they need something desperately because others are not able to get it to them. That's where our 130 general managers spring into action with even more vigor and energy than they have before. And because we see that as something that's able to create a long-term platform of sustainable strength with our customers that will create dividends for many years to come. And so what does that ultimately mean here for the first quarter. We're trying to give the best guidance that we can in light of what we see today in what is still a highly uncertain environment. But there's no doubt about it that the Amphenol team is going to fight hard for every possible opportunity to deliver whatever upside is available to us. Operator : The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. I had a bigger picture question this afternoon, Adam. If Amphenol becomes a larger company with sales, of course, exceeding $10 billion for the first time this year, does it alter your approach to M&A at all, either in terms of the companies that you're targeting or your ability to integrate deals of all sizes? And I suppose the new segment structure could also play into this specifically, you've done two fairly large deals now in an 8-month window in the form of MTS and Halo. Does it say something about the future direction of the company? Or am I just reading too much into your recent deals? Adam Norwitt : No. Luke, it's a great question. I think when we talk about scaling the company, we really think about that in every aspect. Most importantly, we think about making sure that we preserve, secure and evolve that unique operating culture and that we can scale the company amidst that operating culture. That's really step one. But every other aspect of what we do also needs to scale and that includes our M&A program. And I find it really interesting. Over the course of my -- coming close to quarter of a century that I've been with this company 23 years, I started in Amphenol as an M&A intern. So I've been deeply involved in our M&A program all the way back to 1998. And we have said consistently from that time that we would expect that over the long term, acquisitions would roughly represent about 1/3 of our growth -- and that's been the case when we were a less than $900 million revenue company when I joined, all the way to today when we were close to an $11 billion revenue company. And what is interesting, I've referred to these last two years through the cycle, and Craig referred to that as well, we grew by roughly 32% through that cycle, and our organic growth was just over 20% during that time, which tells you that even in a pandemic and even with the size and scale of the company as it is, we've been able to still have acquisitions represent 1/3 of the company's growth. And how do you do that? Well, the arithmetic is pretty straightforward. As the company grows, either you have to make more acquisitions of the same size or you have to make acquisitions a bigger size. And the fact is, I think we've done all of the above. And so when we look at what we have done here with the MTS acquisition, our first-ever public company. When we look at the acquisition at the end of the year of Halo, these are not insignificant sized acquisitions yet we didn't defocus ourselves from making also the really unique enabling tuck-in acquisitions, companies like Positronic and LCAP and Euromicron and CableCon and the like and unlimited services. So we will continue to make acquisitions of all sizes. Now with the new division alignment, it actually opens even further the aperture of the types of deals that we may be able to execute upon because part of what we're doing is creating the bandwidth in our leadership team such that they can devote more time to things like driving collaboration, working with key customers and also making acquisitions. And with the size of these divisions, it would make just as easy as we bring in a $50 million company with the general manager, and we say you're now just part of Amphenol, nothing changes. We can do that with a $1 billion company one day if we find the appropriate company. And so the range of acquisitions, the scale -- the range of the scale of acquisitions that we can make, I think, is really limitless. The opportunity and the resources that we have to devote to executing on those and also making sure that they're successful once we bring them in is also really expanded by this new alignment. And so we see no reason to think amidst this, what is still a very highly fragmented market that we participate in, that M&A can't continue to be a driver like it has been for already more than two decades so far. Operator : The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the previous commentary on M&A strategy. So as does the range of acquisitions widen and maybe the average size pushes higher to kind of achieve that 1/3 growth coming from M&A target. Is there any impact on the multiples that the company is willing to pay or maybe has to pay to go after these larger acquisitions? And are there any maybe increased challenges or difficulty integrating these larger businesses into the broader Amphenol? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, simply put, I don't think it does have an impact on the multiple. I mean, I will just tell you that you take the MTS acquisition, as an example, and we announced just last quarter that we closed on the disposition of the Test & Simulation business. The net multiple that we ended up paying for 1 of the most precious assets in the industry of some of the most highest technology sensors that there is, was not a double-digit multiple when all was said and done. And I think that is a real testament to our ability to navigate a very challenging and very complex acquisition process, our first ever public company, our first ever concurrent disposition of an asset. And in the end, we get a phenomenal organization with some of the best technology in the industry, amazing people, and we do that in a first single-digit multiple. So I think that is a confirmation of the fact that big does not necessarily equal more expensive. And in terms of the integration, we are never going to relax on the very simple principles that we have always applied to acquisitions, large and small. We look for three things when we look for acquisitions. We look for great people with great products and great position. And it's that first criteria, the great people that is for us the true litmus test of whether we will or will not buy a company. And if it does not have those great people, we walk away every day of the week. And by having those great people, that means that there are people that we can rely upon, and we bring them into our organization, especially as its newly aligned and we let them go do their thing. And all we do is we open doors for them for new opportunities that can only come by being part of a company as broad as global and as strong as Amphenol. And so we think if anything else, if anything, as we have grown, as we've scaled the company, it's added momentum to really what has been a flywheel effect of our acquisition program over many years. Operator : The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thanks. I wanted to focus on your automotive business for a second. You outperformed production by an incredible 40% this year. And I was wondering if you could maybe distill that down into how much you think of that came from mix and some of the broader trends in automotive versus share gains? And maybe recenter us for what a -- obviously, that's not sustainable at that level, but like what's a more reasonable go-forward not in any given period, but over time, sort of outgrowth over the coming years given the trends you see in that segment? Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Joe, and I hadn't actually done the math because we don't follow so much what is production and what is not production. I mean we care about the applications that these next-generation technology applications. But no doubt about it, our team did a phenomenal job this year and in particular, did a phenomenal job in capitalizing on new applications. And I would just point to something like the electrification trend where we just had fabulous growth in electrified applications really outperforming and taking more than our fair share of the opportunities in that space. And that's always been our long-term strategy in automotive. We're not trying to take business out of the pockets of those who have it already. That's not a great approach in automotive. But rather we look for the sort of technological innovations and those new adoptions of electronics, and then we aggressively pursue those with our agile entrepreneurial team. And I think that, that's been really successful here in this year. If I look over the course of kind of the last, call it, 13 years since I've been CEO, which really goes back to the low watermark of our automotive business. I mean we've consistently outperformed in automotive by a very significant margin, kind of year in and year out. And what does that mean in terms of a go-forward outperformance I've never put numbers on this, but we would certainly expect that our team would be able to continue to outperform overall units and what that translates into for content versus share versus new applications. I'll let you -- who is a much bigger expert in this market than me kind of sets out those numbers. But we clearly believe that we can continue to outperform. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead. James Suva : Thank you very much. As we wrap it up, a lot of my questions have been answered. I just want to ask 1 about the new segment reporting and kind of your ERP system. Your company has been very well known as being very lean and mean and good controls and folding in everything. So I was just wondering, I assume this doesn't mean like a new ERP system, it doesn't mean a lot more layers of management earlier in the call, you mentioned layers of management or somebody mentioned that. I'm not sure that's what you meant as opposed to just more oversight in communication. But can you talk to us about ERP system because you've done a lot of M&A.  Now you're talking about new reporting and sometimes people wonder about risk there. But I kind of view it as just providing us more information and not more cost and then not a new ERP system. If you could clarify that would be great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Jim, it's a fabulous question, and we do appreciate it. The answer is a very hard no. I mean we run 130 ERP systems around the company. Each of our general managers is responsible for their own ERP systems. Craig has a fabulous and very simple off-the-shelf consolidation software that works over the web and the fact that we now align those businesses into divisions does not change our computer system whatsoever. And yes, I mean, I think it was -- I believe, Will, who asked the question and alluded to the concept of a layer. I mean we have appointed three new presidents of these divisions, which is technically a layer but it's not a layer of bureaucracy, like you would see in many organizations. I mean in terms of the cost of doing this, it's nothing at all. I mean that's a very marginal incremental investment because the staff at this division is effectively a head of the division with the financial controller to buy his or her side. So it's -- this is not building infrastructure and building layers and bureaucracy. Far from it, it's just creating the bandwidth across our leadership team across what is now 12 group general managers in those three divisions, whereby the 130 general managers can be enabled. We can drive them. We can set aggressive goals, work with them on solving problems when they're small enough to solve and capitalize on opportunities when they're small enough and early enough to capitalize and to capture. And that's been the Amphenol style ever since I was a General Manager just reported to the CEO. And -- but as we've grown, you cannot just have 130 people reporting to one that doesn't work. You lose the benefit of being part of a broader Amphenol and then become just a holding company. And that's not what we are. We're not at all a holding company. In fact, there is a close interaction, close collaboration, synthesis across those 130 entrepreneurial general managers. We have a term for it. We call it a collaborative entrepreneur, and that's really when we say an Amphenolian that's really what we mean. So -- this is not at all creating new computer systems, new layers, new costs, rather, it's enabling and ensuring the scalability of our unique entrepreneurial structure for many, many years to come as we pass $10 billion here in sales. Operator : The next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead. David Kelley : Good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Thanks for squeezing me in. I was hoping to get some color on recent gross margin trends in light of some of the unique moving parts, inflation, supply chain, you've also done several acquisitions. And then longer term, you've been at 32% historically. Is that the right way to think about core gross margins for the core business? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, David. Gross margin is always kind of sometimes a difficult thing to specifically look at with our business. I mean, over time, maybe it's the trending of it is more applicable. But certainly, in any quarters, it's kind of difficult just because of the -- our markets to bring them with them different gross margins and also different operating expense levels. And so that's why we really just don't look at gross margins or measure ourselves based on the gross margin level. We really look at kind of an operating margin level. I think what you kind of need to look at is ultimately that operating margin, and that's trending over time. And certainly over the last 10 years, we've had a certainly a strong performance and growth of that operating margin level, and that's kind of what you kind of need to focus on. I think 10, 20, 50 basis points, even 100 basis point movement in our gross margin isn't necessarily unexpected, given strength in maybe a mobile device market or industrial market, which brings very different gross margins or a Sensor business tends to have higher gross margins and higher SG&A. So I really just wouldn't so much focus. We do tend to get these questions quite a bit, but it's really the operating margins that ultimately, we measure ourselves on. We drive our performance on. And ultimately, I think you should probably focus more on. Operator : And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. You may go ahead. Joseph Giordano : Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. We kind of picked through most. I just wanted to touch on the orders. I mean I think everyone understands that there's a pretty good underlying demand across a lot of these markets. But there does seem to be not just with your results, but others like a scrambling to order stuff in this fourth quarter. Like as you think about the underlying demand and what the orders look like right now, like entering January, do you feel like book-to-bill goes below 1, like at some point over the next couple of quarters? I know we're not doing full year guidance, but just can you kind of compare orders to underlying demand? Adam Norwitt : Yes. I think, Joe, we're -- it's hard for us to give a prognosis on what our book-to-bill is going to be. We had a very strong book-to-bill in the year. We finished with a strong book-to-bill. It's clear that our customers want to give us orders. What that book-to-bill will be going forward is actually really hard to predict.  Operator, I think if that's all of our questions. I'd like to just extend my appreciation to everybody on the phone here for spending your precious time with us I wish you all the best as you start the year, and most importantly, I just hope that all of you are able to stay safe and healthy, and we look forward to hearing from you again in just 90 days. Thanks so much, and Happy New Year again. Craig Lampo : Thank you, everybody. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2022 conference call. Our first quarter results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current strategies, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as previously announced, effective January 1, 2022, we aligned our businesses into three new reportable segments. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, we are reporting results for these new segments as well as the relevant comparable historical financial data. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.95 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.68 and $0.67, respectively. First quarter sales were up 24% in US dollars, 25% in local currencies and 17% organically compared to the first quarter of 2021. The significant sales increase was driven by double digit organic growth in the IT data communications, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. Sequentially, sales were down by just 2% in US dollars and in local currencies and down 4% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders for the quarter were a record $3.441 billion, which is up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and up 5% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.17:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $590 million in the first quarter and operating margin was a strong 20% in the first quarter of 2022, which increased by 40 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margins declined by only 10 basis points, which is significantly better than we typically see in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase in operating margin was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment, together with the slight margin dilution of acquisitions completed over the past year. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal conversion on the lower sales volumes, slightly offset by the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which became effective in the quarter. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the strength of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high performance, action oriented management team. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68 in the first quarter, an increase of 28% compared to $0.53 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, an increase of 29% compared to the $0.52 in the first quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges the company continued to face during the quarter. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 23.9% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Bringing down first quarter results into our three new segments. Relative to the first quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $728 million and increased 16% in US dollars and organically. Operating margins in the quarter for the segment was 25.2%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.320 billion and increased 28% in US dollars and 21% organically. Operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 21.4%. Sales in the Interconnect & Sensor Systems segment were $904 million and increased 25% in US dollars and 13% organically and operating margin in the quarter for the segment was 17.7%. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $351 million or 83% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $274 million or 65% of adjusted net income. Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would normally expect even in a typically weaker first quarter, primarily due to a higher than normal increase in inventory levels, driven by the continued challenging supply chain environment. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 74 and 57 days, respectively, both within a normal range. Inventory days were 88, which are slightly elevated due to the normal Q1 seasonality as well as the challenging supply chain reasons just mentioned. Our management teams are focused on reducing these inventory levels, although given the challenging environment, this may take a couple of quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $78. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2022 was more than $320 million. Total debt at March 31st was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.6 billion. And total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. First quarter 2022 GAAP EBITDA was $699 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2020, our net leverage ratio is 1.3 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and it's my pleasure also to welcome everybody here for our first quarter earnings call. And first and foremost, I hope that everybody here today, together with your family, friends and colleagues are managing to stay safe and healthy as the world comes to some degree of normalcy. Again, I also wanted to just offer our thoughts to the people of Ukraine, who are obviously going through this very difficult time period with the unfortunate war. While we don't have operations in the Ukraine, we do have many employees of Ukrainian descent and our hearts are clearly with them together with their families and friends. As Craig mentioned, we wanted to highlight or I'm going to highlight some of our first quarter achievements. I'll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'm going to comment on our outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll then have time for questions at the end. As Craig mentioned, we drove results in the first quarter that were substantially beyond our original expectations, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales as well as adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 24% in US dollars and 25% in local currencies, reaching $2.952 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by 17% with growth across nearly all of our end markets and that was driven particularly by double digit growth in the IT datacom, commercial air, industrial, automotive and broadband markets, and I'll talk about each of those in a few moments. The company booked a record $3.441 billion in orders in the first quarter, and this represented another very strong book-to-bill this time 1.17:1. And despite continuing to face substantial inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, our operating margins reached 20.0% in the quarter, which was a 40 basis point increase from last year's levels. We're very encouraged by the strong profitability performance for the company, and we see that as a clear sign that our local management teams are successfully managing through this challenging cost environment. Diluted EPS in the quarter grew a robust 29% from prior year to $0.67, again, an excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. The company also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $351 million and $274 million, and that's despite all of the challenges that Craig alluded to. And again, another clear reflection of the high quality of the company's earnings. I'm just very proud of our team this quarter. These results once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our end markets. I would just comment that we continue to be very pleased that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. And in particular, amidst these very dynamic times, this market diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol. Now starting with our military market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by 7% from prior year and were up 1% organically with growth in space and avionics applications somewhat offset by moderations in our sales on to UAVs, naval and military vehicles. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 2%, which was just a hair below our expectations coming into the quarter. And looking now into the second quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's position in the defense market, a market that has renewed importance given the current geopolitical environment. As militaries around the world continue to accelerate their adoption of next generation technologies, our industry leading breadth of high technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major military programs. This gives us great confidence for our long term performance. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in commercial air increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 28% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew by a better-than-expected 8% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, while we do expect a sequential moderation of sales compared to these first quarter levels, we anticipate another quarter of year-over-year growth in commercial air. After two very challenging years in the air travel industry, we're encouraged by the strengthening of our ComAir business. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms as well as the next generation systems that are integrated into those planes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter, and we drove another quarter of excellent performance in the industrial market. Sales grew 31% in US dollars and 20% organically, and this was driven by robust growth across most of the segments within the industrial market. But we did see particular strength in battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, factory automation and oil and gas, as well as the benefits of several of the acquisitions that we've done over the last year. On a sequential basis, sales were down just 1% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into this quarter. Looking into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to increase moderately from current levels. So this first quarter confirmed once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 17% in US dollars and organically with our growth, driven once again by the strength of our sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, sales increased by 5% from the fourth quarter which is actually much better than our expectations of a high single digit decline. And this just reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential decline in sales as customers manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working across the automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment all while remaining laser focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicle platforms. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of that team's excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 7% from prior year, with strength in tablets, smartphones, wearables as well as laptops. Sequentially, our sales decline was less than we had expected, declining 27% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we now anticipate a low double digit sequential sales decline from these levels, driven by typical seasonality, as well as by some impact from the recent COVID-related shutdowns that have been occurring and continue to occur in China. There's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2022 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter and sales in this market grew from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as strength from products sold directly to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions more than offset a moderation of our sales to equipment OEMs. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were flat to the levels that we achieved in the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we expect a modest decline from these first quarter levels. Nevertheless, we're encouraged to see continued strength in our sales to the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. We look forward, especially to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected in IT datacom, rising by a very robust 41% in US dollars and 35% organically from prior year as our teams capitalized on broad based strength across server and networking applications. And in particular, we saw continued robust growth of our sales to web service provider and data center operator customers. We were pleased that sales moderated by just 2% sequentially in the first quarter, which was better than our expectations coming into Q1. Looking to the second quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single digits from these first quarter levels as customer demand continues to grow in IT datacom. We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in this important market. Our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of our leading position for many years to come. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market also grew by a very strong 47% from prior year and 12% organically, as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 30% from the fourth quarter. And we're pleased, in particular, to start to see some progress in pricing actions across this market. In the second quarter, we expect sales to the broadband market to increase modestly from these levels. And we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high speed data applications to both homes and businesses, our products have become even more critical. Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter. The current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges being in many ways exacerbated by both the war in Ukraine, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic, which is causing shutdowns in certain geographies, most notably in China. Assuming conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming, of course, constant exchange rates, for the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. These expectations would represent strong sales growth of 9% to 11% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11% versus the second quarter of last year. I just have to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges that are still present in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our organization remains committed to delivering long term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued safety and health of each of our employees around the world. And I'd just like to take this opportunity at the end here to thank all of those employees, more than 90,000 of them around the world, the entire Amphenol team, for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : My question is really around -- and I'm hoping, Adam, you would just elaborate on what are the impacts you're seeing out of the China lockdown maybe on two fronts. So one is, how are you thinking about that impacting your supply, your demand environment coming out of China? And secondly, do you think this is really resulting in customers perhaps deciding to hold on to more inventory for longer versus trying to get back to just-in-time models if that's the discussion as being happen with your customers? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, relative to our own supply and demand, there's no doubt about it that our team is navigating lots of things in China. And I just have to take a moment to really reflect on how extraordinary they have managed through the first quarter, because some of these disruptions, they already have started well into the first quarter. And the fact that our team was able to drive the results that they did across the board and including in China is a real testament to the reactivity, the agility, the fortitude of our team there because these lockdowns are really quite something. We have employees who are sort of locked in their apartment in Shanghai for four or five weeks. We have factories that have had to operate in bubbles and things like this. And it's just extraordinary how the team has managed through this. But no doubt about it. I mean we see some impact. It's not a massive impact here in the quarter, but there is some impact here in the quarter. And I specifically talked about the impact that we see in mobile devices which is the one market that has the highest exposure to China. So it shouldn't be surprising that, that's one where there's maybe a little more magnitude of impact, both with customers and their demand and the supply chain and our own abilities to reach really full levels of production. But our team is doing a fabulous job and I think that they will manage through this. And I'm very confident that China as a country is going to manage through this. No question in my mind. Relative to customers holding more inventory, I think that whole concept of just in time has in many ways over the last two years been a little bit replaced by to find a cliche, just in case. And no doubt, we have customers who are looking at lots of ways to balance risk in their supply chain. I think their first choice is not just to put inventory on the shelves, but rather to look to their supplier partners, companies like us and say, what can we do to create diversification in the supply base, such that they don't have all their eggs in one basket. And no doubt, we've done a lot of work over these couple of years through the pandemic, through the supply chain crisis, through the logistics crisis, whatever that may be, to demonstrate to our customers and ultimately to deliver to our customers a kind of multiplicity of options of supply that thereby minimize their risk. But beyond that, are customers kind of opening up their order window a little more, I think we would say, yes, are customers putting a little more inventory on the shelf. There, I can only speak with anecdotal evidence, because we don't have great visibility into the warehouses and the inventory levels of our OEM or service provider customers. The one where we do have visibility, which is our distribution channel, I would actually say that inventory levels there are even a little low in many of the relationships that we have and certainly not at levels that one would think are reflective of some sort of risk aversion. So I think customers are doing a lot of things here. Is the odd customer carrying a little bit more inventory, it wouldn't surprise me if that were the case. Operator : The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Thank you very much for taking the question, which is about the M&A landscape. I'm curious to what extent you're seeing any increased willingness of companies to be acquired, financial markets are at good absolute levels, but you've seen some pullback recently in valuations. So curious if more companies are perhaps willing to be open to an acquisition? And could you also speak to Amphenol's willingness to do larger acquisitions? You've done a few larger ones of late, including Halo and MTS and I'm wondering, do you think you need to time digesting those, or would you be willing to do a larger acquisition if the opportunity presented itself? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, I don't know that we've seen any meaningful difference in the M&A environment. I would tell you the M&A environment is very robust. Our pipeline is as strong as ever. As you know, over the last two and half years, we closed on a large number of deals, including last year, just the extraordinary progress that we made in our M&A program with very significant deals like MTS and at the end of the year, Halo, as well as the number of wonderful tuck-in companies, tuck-in deals that then ultimately strengthen our position across a wide array of our end markets. And I think that we continue to see among companies that we talk to, I don\u2019t know if it's a general willingness -- increased willingness, but our reputation is a wonderful home for their companies, that continues to strengthen over time. And so there's no doubt about it that our phone continues to ring. We continue to to create that sort of organic pipeline of acquisitions. And not a week goes by where Craig and I don't hear of some new company that we had never heard of. At the same time, we have very high standards. And so to the point that if companies are kind of coming out of the wood work, we're not just saying yes to every one of these. We hold very, very high standards around our acquisition program. And that includes looking for great people with great products who have complementary market position. And that is never going to be something that we compromise and nor do we ever compromise on valuation because at the end of the day, whether the stock market is higher or the stock market is low, we pay fair value for great companies. And we pay a value that\u2019s really based on what they have delivered and not what the company can become as part of Amphenol. In terms of our willingness to do larger deals, I would just let our history speak almost for itself here. I mean, for sure, we have the wherewithal to do an enormous number of deals, and that includes deals large and small. I would say that the evolution of our organization, one of the benefits of that is really also opening up the bandwidth across the company so that we have capacity to either do more deals or bigger deals, both of which we kind of arithmetically need to do if we want acquisitions to continue to represent roughly a third of our growth over the long term, which is what we continue to target. So I think the M&A landscape remains a very positive driver for Amphenol. And I think the strategy of complementing our superior organic growth with adding excellent companies is something that has created enormous value for the company past and we'll continue to do so going forward. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Manmohan on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to ask like the way we were thinking and where some of the investors you were talking to, like we were expecting you to have a higher than -- higher headwinds in terms of margins compared to your peers, but you have -- but the results were a little contrary to that with better operating margins than peers, both for current quarter as well as for the next quarter. So is there like the expectations were there due to the decentralized way of functioning the centralized hedging activity was lesser. So what exactly is things that we are missing here? Is this entirely due to better success with price increases or some other dynamics here at work? Craig Lampo : I mean, we talked about this a little bit coming into the quarter in January. We certainly saw some pressures from the cost environment as everybody has. And I think we did a great job in 2021 really protecting against that through pricing and then certainly other actions as well. And we talked about in the fourth quarter where our margins were a bit lower than we did expect coming into the first quarter. Some improvement in profitability as we kind of reflected in our guidance and our implied guidance that our profitability improved from pricing actions starting to take hold, and that's exactly what we saw. I think the team has done a fabulous job of ensuring that they were taking the actions they needed to. There's no doubt we're in an inflationary environment. And there's a lot of difficult conversations that we're having with customers on a frequent basis. This isn't something that's happening just on annually anymore. This is something that's happening on probably a monthly basis or maybe even sometimes more frequent than that as we continue to see costs rise. And I think the team has done a great job with that. We don't do any hedging. We don't talk -- hedging is something that we typically don't do other than maybe FX hedging or things of that nature. But certainly, as it relates to commodity costs, we don't do any of that. So that certainly has no impact on our margins. But certainly, the pricing actions we've taken with our customers are starting to take hold here in the first quarter. We're expecting that to continue into the second quarter in our implied guidance of our margins continuing to improve a bit here into the second quarter. And I'm certainly real proud of the team. I mean the inflationary environment has gotten worse here in the first quarter and we certainly don't expect it to get any better in the second quarter. So the ability of our team to continue to protect them not only protect the margins, but starting to expand the margins a bit and starting to basically offset -- more than offset some of the cost environment is certainly great to see and we're going to continue to work hard to do the same thing as the inflationary environment continues. Operator : Next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : I was wondering if you could drill down a little more into the IT datacom segment. As I mentioned before, it keeps surprising for the upside for you guys. I'm curious like when you -- what you're seeing during the quarter from both a market standpoint and then a content standpoint, whether we're missing the boat maybe on market shares or just better content on certain interconnect products? Or is it all related to spending coming in better than you think? Any color there would be helpful. Adam Norwitt : And Steve, you're never missing any boats. So I wouldn't say that. Look, we're just -- our IT datacom business and the operations within Amphenol who are serving that end market have just done a phenomenal job over the last two years on several fronts. Number one, it's developing the products that our customers need. And I think the innovation in this market is so critical because our customers are under enormous pressure, enormous pressure to satisfy this kind of unquenchable thirst among consumers for bandwidth, and at the other side, the kind of unquenchable thirst for power that these data centers create. And so where we've seen the real innovations is happening around high speed interconnect across the board, as well as in the power interconnect that goes to drive the efficiency of these systems in a way that ultimately these data centers don't become such [positive] of energy. And I think on both of those fronts, we just continue to see this immutable march forward and drive for customers to really push the limits of technology, and that's something where our engineers are just really excelling. Whether it's designing the latest high speed interconnects such that we can stretch the ability of copper interconnect far beyond what people ever thought was possible and thereby saving both cost as well as power consumption and the design resources of our customers to designing really complex power interconnects that ultimately reduce the power consumption of these data centers and make them more efficient. There's a lot of work going on there. At the same time, coupled with those great products, has been our consistent, and I will say, really consistent through this whole cycle of the pandemic, ability to satisfy the needs of our customers even when those needs change dramatically in a moment's notice. And that responsiveness and the fact that we never let our customers down, while others were consistently letting them down, has meant that our customers come to us more and more and give to us maybe a disproportionate share of their needs because they know that we're there for them when they need us the most. I remember so clearly, in the second quarter of 2020 going all the way back to kind of the beginning of the pandemic, when everybody started going on to video calls and video meetings and the bandwidth just kind of exploded and people were watching over-the-top video at home, Netflix and other things like that. And our customers came to us with not just marginal increases in demand but multiples of increase of demand, and we just figured out a way to make it happen. And that's the entrepreneurial reactivity of Amphenol that we talk about so often. And I think the customers in IT datacom have been real beneficiaries of that. And we've been recognized by our customers, not just with more share but with more supplier awards than I can remember in my entire career, over this time period, recognition from those customers, both OEMs and service providers that Amphenol really differentiated ourselves in terms of our reactivity and our reactions. What's that market going to be going forward? I think the demand for bandwidth does not seem to abate. Are we always going to grow by 35% organically in the quarter? I don't know that I would go out and commit to that. But I think our team has done a great job positioning us to outperform for a long time to come. Operator : Next question is from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Nick Todorov : Adam, I think you mentioned that you're starting to see some progress on pricing in the broadband market. I know that has been one of the most difficult ones to get the pricing through. Can you please help us unpack there a little bit? What is causing that change? And what are you able to do in terms of offsetting the impact of inflation that you're seeing there and maybe generally across the business? Adam Norwitt : I did make that mention, and we think some portion of our organic growth, certainly not the totality, but some portion is a credit to our teams, long term and very challenging efforts on pricing. I mean the thing about our traditional broadband business, as you know, is it has a very high material content but it hasn't always had a very rational competitive landscape. And so I think what we're starting to see now is the severity of the inflation has really woken up the other participants in the market that there needs to be some reasonable sharing of that inflation with customers, and we've always been at the forefront of that. I've said for many, many years that we don't let the sun set on a pricing action from our peers in order to match that and to keep up with these inflationary pressures. And I think we've taken maybe even more of a leadership position over the course of the last year or so. And we're pleased to see some signs of maybe a little bit more discipline in that market that didn't traditionally have as much discipline. And it is a market where the inflation has a disproportionate impact because of the higher material content, the raw material content, things like plastics and metals and the like. And so we're hopeful, it's certainly not a kind of fully told story here but we're encouraged to start to see a little bit more progress in pricing in that market. Operator : Next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. James Suva : While it's very sad about the world conflict that's happening in Russia and Europe and such. Taking a step back, I wonder, are you seeing and having discussions with defense companies that are maybe doing, say, electronic radars, surveillance, smart warfare, defense items, a material pickup, because with the supply chain issues, it'd be tough to simply put in an order and expect it pretty quickly. So I'm wondering if this is kind of a sector that all of a sudden unexpectedly and for sad situations start to see a pretty sharp increase in demand for the defense. Adam Norwitt : And I would use the same adjectives as you that it is a sad situation what is happening in Ukraine, tragic in many respects. But I would also tell you that we're proud of the role that our company has played, both in supporting refugees coming from the Ukraine and some of the neighboring countries where we have operations. Not only supporting them monetarily but also providing jobs to some. I mean, this has been a real initiative by our team to support these people who have really had their livelihoods crushed. And at the same time, I think we've all witnessed the power of defense and that some of these new technologies that we have talked about for so many years have real importance in people's lives to keep a country safe in the face of what I think many would consider unreasonable aggression. So I wouldn't want to comment on specific conversations that we have in the defense industry. You can imagine that that's not something that we would want to do. But I think we're encouraged for the long term to see that many countries are waking up to the fact that maybe the defense budgets should be calibrated a little bit better to the level of threat that may very well exist in the world in order to keep the peace loving people of the world more secure. And that can translate into overall spending and it can translate long term into an acceleration of adoption of technologies. I've talked for a long time about the kind of difference in the defense industry between the more tactical defense spending and the more strategic defense spending. And I think, Jim, you've covered us probably as long as anyone and you've heard that theme before. And I think what we're seeing here is, no doubt about it, a shift of market and relatively rapid shift in the focus of countries, especially those countries in NATO towards an emphasis of strategic defense. And whenever you start talking about strategic defense, you immediately start to talk about technology. You talk about radar, you talk about missile defense. You talk about all of the things that electronics can do to protect people in their homes and in their sovereign nations. And I think Amphenol has played a leading role over the years in being an enabler of those kind of next-generation electronic defense systems. And so to the extent that this tragic and unfortunate conflict does drive an even greater focus among NATO countries. We certainly sit as the leader in the military interconnect market in a position to really help those countries to help the companies that are supporting that initiative in really adopting next-generation technology to protect all of the citizens of these sovereign countries. Operator : Next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Appreciate the new segment disclosures. It seems like the operating margins here are ranging from 17% to 26% based on the segment. Can you talk about what is driving the dispersion there? Because in your 10-K, you do report most of these -- all three of these segments more or less cover all of your end markets. And you gave some color about the products too, but would love to hear from you, Adam. But maybe what is it that's driving that delta in margins? And as you think about M&A, is there a propensity to lean towards one versus another segment? Craig Lampo : I'll take this one, at least the first part of it. Yes, certainly, you're right. We have -- there's a range in margins of our segments. I mean I don't think that's so surprising. I mean we have 130 businesses. And you can't imagine that some of them are above the company average and some of them are certainly below the company average. And our businesses are typically based on product technologies that have application across many different markets. I mean we're very diversified from a market perspective. And one of the things we try to do for all of our businesses to apply our products amongst those -- proliferate our products amongst all the markets in which they have the -- they can add value. And that, I think, has been the strength of the company and certainly has driven growth over the years. So that's the same as our segments. We didn't -- our segments aren't a market focused segments. Our segments are product focused segments for the most part that does serve many different markets. So certainly, there's no correlation from a market perspective. I guess mention is that there is -- in our communication solutions market, there is the broadband and mobile device markets are typically -- or the vast majority of those markets are served by that segment. But other than those, the rest of the six segments effectively are broad based amongst all of our segments. And as it relates to margin, as I mentioned, that some operations are above and some of it are below. I don't think there's really much to draw from in terms of the the profitability from -- again, from a market or necessarily from a specific business perspective. I think that when I think about the segments, clearly, over time, we spend a lot of time on the businesses that have the lower profitability, including certainly acquisitions. The Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment has a couple more acquisitions, recent acquisitions in it, specifically MTS, which did drive actually the year-over-year reduction kind of in the margin in that particular business. So as you can imagine, we're working, as we talked about with those businesses to drive up the profitability over time. But I think that we don't have margin or conversion margin targets by segment, but we certainly do an overall company level, that hasn't changed and we talked about the 25% conversion margin. As you can imagine, the higher profitability businesses are going to convert possibly a little bit higher than the lower profitability businesses. But ultimately, our goal is to drive profitability up in all of our businesses and ultimately, all of our segments over time. But I wouldn't necessarily point out anything specific that's driving that significant margin differences other than that's kind of how the businesses ultimately were segmented for management reporting purposes. Adam Norwitt : And relative to your question on M&A, Wamsi, no question, we have a propensity to look for acquisitions across every one of our markets and across all of our 3 now segments as we call them. We're not at all going to kind of direct our resources strategically towards one or another. They all have -- it's an equal opportunity resource for all of them. And to the extent that we find strong acquisitions with the criteria that I alluded to earlier, we're very aggressive and happy to make those acquisitions regardless of which segment it's in. Operator : The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : I have maybe what's a part backward and forward-looking question. And specifically, Adam, I'm wondering if there's any color on bookings or orders in your auto business specifically you could share after obviously a very big increase in that business in 2021 and here in the first quarter as well. I looked back a couple of months ago to the 10-K, you included some language on the overall business is stating that the increase in the company's backlog was with the significant sales increase given the significant sales increase in auto specifically. How should we think about that backlog and orders relative to that end market? Adam Norwitt : I mean it's interesting. When we look across all of our end markets in terms of our book-to-bill, we had pretty strong books-to-bill across really all of our end markets with the exception of mobile devices where it's always kind of one-to-one, and I think broadband was also relatively flat book-to-bill. But all the other markets had pretty robust books to bill. And I would say maybe automotive was even a little below the average, but still a strong, more than one book-to-bill. And I don't know that I would draw any conclusions about automotive and the past performance or the trajectory based on those bookings. I think what I would just highlight again is that our performance in automotive has been really consistently outperforming the end market, whatever the end market is. Lots of people take lots of different cuts at what is end market performance units or whatever it is. But for sure our growth in this quarter where we achieved 17% growth that was on the heels of last quarter where we grew 18%, the quarter before, 31%. The quarter before that was even this kind of crazy number of more than 100%. And I just think that it's a reflection of the dynamics that I have talked about earlier and before, which is the higher content that we see on next-generation platforms. In particular, we've seen a market increase in the adoption of electrification, electrified drivetrains, and our team has done a fabulous job to position themselves in that area. And we're doing that really across the globe, really broadly from a geographical perspective. And then all the other new electronic systems that are coming into cars where we're not necessarily taking share from out of one pocket, but we are maybe getting a little more than our fair share of these new things because of our reactivity to the customers and the appropriateness and the breadth of the technology that we can offer from the interconnect products, connectors, value-add interconnect products, sensors and antennas. And so I think our position in automotive, while certainly we're not the biggest in the automotive interconnect space far from it, but I think our performance has really been differentiated because of our ability to really capture a little bit more than our fair share of these new things. Operator : The next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : First, you may have quantified it, if you had, I apologize for asking, but the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns in China that you're seeing. If you've already answered that, perhaps you can talk about linearity of bookings and whether you've seen any perturbations from what's going on in either Ukraine or China and any erosion into April. Adam Norwitt : I don't think we put an exact number on the COVID shutdowns, and we don't plan to I think we -- it's not like a massive impact. It's also hard to count it. I mean every day it's changing a little bit, but there's certainly some impact, And I think I mentioned earlier, we see it most in the mobile devices, but we see it in a few other markets as well, like automotive and IT datacom and industrial. In terms of the linearity of bookings, our first quarter, we saw pretty good strength through the quarter. I mean, February is a short month of sort of Chinese New Year, but we finished the quarter really strong and bookings in March were really strong indeed. And April, we're still three days away from the end, so I couldn't even give you a number if I wanted to, but we'll see how it goes here in April. I mean would I expect a 1.17:1 book-to-bill here in the second quarter? I don't think I would expect that. I didn't expect it coming into the first quarter and we had very strong bookings. But I don't expect that here in the second quarter, but we'll see. I think customers still have quite a propensity to give us business new and existing, and that's translating into very robust orders for quite a number of quarters here. Operator : The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris Snyder : I wanted to follow up on the prior commentary around customers more so valuing diversification in their supply chain, which certainly screens positive for a global leader like Amphenol. But my question is where is this dynamic filling up and where would you expect to show up? Is it just the rate of share gains maybe helping with some of these pricing negotiations? Or could you even help facilitate M&A for maybe some of your smaller competitors who might be on the opposite side of that equation? Adam Norwitt : Look, it's hard to sort of pinpoint it because at the end of the day, why does the customer give us an order in any given moment? I mean, there's an enormous number of factors that go into that all along the spectrum, from the technology that we offer, the reliability of our delivery to that customer, our quality, our support, the breadth of our relationship, obviously, the price that\u2019s something that no customer wants to ever forget about. And so as you build over a long term a sustainable advantage with customers, it's all about continuing to just add to each of those factors further reason for customers to place an order to you and not to your competitor. And I think over the last two years -- look, over a long time, that's always our focus. How do we have a little bit better product? How do we have a little bit better quality? How do we have a little bit better credibility of delivery? How do we have a more competitive cost by going to low-cost countries and the like? But what has changed over these two years is there's a new factor that customers are considering and that is risk. And I will tell you that over many years, I've been -- now I'm in my 24th year in this company and my 14th year as CEO, I think customers underaccounted for risk in many cases because it was just easy to say, well, here's the price and the quality is good and it's the right product. And we don't really need to think about all these kind of black swan events that may or may not happen. And by the way, that was true through earthquakes and tsunamis, that was true through volcanos in Iceland and floods in Thailand and all these things. But something about the last two years has caused them really to wake up to think about the real risk of their supply chain. And when they do that and they look at the landscape of competitors, they look at a small company and they see risk. They look at a centralized company, and they see risk. But when they look at Amphenol and they look at our decentralized, very fragmented, very global, we have more than, what, something like 250 factories around the world, which is a lot more than most companies of our size. There, they see not risk, but actually opportunity. And I think that, that change has been just another factor that didn't exist in the past. And where does it manifest? I mean I think it does manifest to some degree in our outperformance and then the continuation of our outperformance. As it relates to M&A, I think there is actually also an advantage because if you're a small company, and you've been through this kind of rubicon of challenges that we've all faced over these couple of years, being part of a bigger company that gives you more options of where you can make stuff and where you can source stuff and where you can sell stuff, so that starts to be a pretty compelling thing to think about, if you really truly care about the company that you as an entrepreneur have built. And so I think that can also have an advantage. I think there's advantages that sort of go throughout the business. And it's, again, why we're so religious about our adherence to the culture of Amphenol, that unique entrepreneurial culture, which has served us in good times and bad. And I think the value of it has been more enhanced over these last couple of years than really ever before. Operator : Next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : I was hoping to drill down on industrials. You posted another really strong quarter there. And just given your broad exposure, can you walk us through how you're thinking about the industrials market growth visibility? And what feels like a strong CapEx cycle but also an uncertain near-term global macro. And then just curious as your thoughts on the potential magnitude of content outgrowth given what, again, feels like I would argue unprecedented pace of technology transformation currently undergoing in industrials? Adam Norwitt : No doubt about it. Our team working and industrial market has just been consistently outstanding in their performance. I mean, since the kind of acute phase of COVID in Q1 of 2020, at least in Asia, we've posted consistently strong double-digit year-over-year growth every quarter since then. So we just did our eighth straight quarter in industrial of strong double-digit growth, and it's really a testament to their efforts. And as you pointed out, it's a very broad market. It's everything from advanced medical equipment to next-generation agricultural equipment, to high-speed rail, to semiconductor manufacturing equipment, to heavy equipment, to electrification of heavy vehicles and battery technology, battery storage, where we see just a lot of opportunities to enable a real myriad of customers who are developing next-generation energy storage systems and they want our sensors, they want our connectors. They want everything. I mean these applications are really all over the place. And they all go on somewhat different cycles, I should say. But at the end of the day, they have one thing in common, which is it is the adoption of electronics into harsh environments, into areas where those electronics otherwise should not really be able to operate. And that is a legacy that we have of many, many decades of building up the capability of packaging interconnect and sensors for harsh environments, which now means putting highly computerized autonomous driving systems on tractors, and now means putting next-generation sensor technologies and alternative energy devices and monitoring of wind mills and things like this. I mean, I could go on and on and on. And amidst the uncertain global macro, you have the certainty of the continued onward and upward march of the adoption of electronics. So I'm not going to say that we're going to grow every quarter here in perpetuity by these outstanding amounts. No, I mean, I wouldn't expect that we're going to grow by 31% every quarter going forward. But I do believe that the opportunity to outperform here remains very strong and that the breadth of our industrial product technologies is really second to none, and I think that positions us well for the future. Operator : Next question is from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Maybe just to go back to one of the other questions about in the end markets and sort of being pretty well split across all the new segments. Is the implication also that the growth you've laid out for the entire company organic and second quarter, like is that also evenly split by the new reporting segments? Is there any sort of color in terms of how we should think about the segment performance would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : I mean we're not guiding necessarily to growth by segment. I think we gave a lot of details by each of our end markets. But as you saw this quarter, I mean, the growth was pretty balanced across those segments. Now we had really broad growth across the company. So I wouldn't necessarily say that what we would expect by each segment going into here in the second quarter. Operator : Our last question comes from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joe Giordano : Just wanted to -- on auto, obviously, the performance has been really good for a long time relative to peers, relative to the market, however you want to cut it. I'm just curious like if you were to break down the outperformance in like large buckets as to what's driving it. Maybe I can leave it open ended there. But I'm also curious as to how much maybe is -- with production being constrained here and focused on SUVs, high-end EVs, like kind of the things that are probably best for you, how much of that is driving some of this as well? Adam Norwitt : I mean I don't know that there's a significant impact, Joe, from kind of the hot potato of people crossing semiconductors back and forth and deciding where they should put their -- which vehicles they should put them in and thereby which they should sell and prioritize. I mean, look, if our customers are building higher content cars, is that a good thing? Yes, I guess that would certainly be a good thing. But that should be a good thing for everybody in the market. And I think would that drive specifically our outperformance? I don't know that, that would necessarily be the case. I think really what we see, and I'll just reiterate it again, is we see just an acceleration of the adoption of next-generation systems across all vehicles, and that includes the electrified drivetrains that we mentioned, but not exclusively that. It's next-generation infotainment, next-generation communication, it's next-generation comfort, passenger comfort, it's next-generation connectivity in the cars, it's everything from sensors that keep the HVAC systems running better and being safer for the people inside. I mean, you think about like going through a respiratory-borne illness pandemic and all of a sudden, car companies want to have better HVAC filtration and sensing inside their cars. And that's a great new application that may not have existed kind of in the past. And so I think that's the bigger driver here than just that some car companies are making more tactical decisions about which models to produce based on constrained availability of certain components. Well, thank you very much to everybody. I think that's our last question. And I do want to take this opportunity, once again, to thank you all for spending a few of your precious time -- a few of your precious minutes with us today and wish you all the best, and we look forward to seeing everybody again either over the course of this quarter or at the latest 90 days from now. Thanks so much, everybody. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the second quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Our second quarter 2022 results were released this morning, and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions.  As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all data discussed during this call is on a continuing operations basis, including prior year comparative information.  The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.137 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.76 and $0.75, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, 8% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $3.449 billion, which was up 11% compared to the second quarter of 2021, and relatively flat sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1. Both GAAP and adjusted operating income were $649 million in the second quarter of this year, and GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 20.7% in the second quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 280 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021, and 70 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, GAAP operating margin for the prior year quarter included $55 million of acquisition-related costs as a result of the MTS acquisition.  On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volume as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions, which we believe have offset a meaningful amount of the inflation-related cost increases.  On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected operating leverage on the higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. Given the dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of operational and supply chain challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team.  Breaking down second quarter results by segment. Relative to the second quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $790 million and increased by 14% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment was $1.378 billion, an increase by 24% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically. Segment operating margin was 22%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $968 million, an increase by 15% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.3%.  The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 23 -- was 23.3%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 17.5% and 24.5% in the second quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.76 in the second quarter, an increase of 29% compared to $0.59 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.75, an increase of 23% compared to $0.61 in the second quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the significant cost, supply chain and other operational challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter, including certain COVID-related shutdowns in China. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was a record $543 million or 117% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $452 million or 97% of adjusted net income.  Given the continued supply chain challenges, we were pleased to see cash flow yield recover back to normal levels in the second quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 72 and 58 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And inventory days were 86, which was slightly elevated due to the challenging supply chain environment that continued in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the second quarter of 2022 was $305 million. Total debt at June 30 was $4.9 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2022 EBITDA was $759 million. And at the end of the second quarter, our net leverage ratio was 1.2x.  I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Richard Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I hope that all of you on the call here today are enjoying the summer so far, and most importantly, your family, your friends and your colleagues are all still managing to stay safe and healthy. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. And then I'm going to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And then finally, we'll, of course, have time for questions.  As Craig just went over, our results in the second quarter were much better than expected. We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 18% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of $3.137 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 18%, supported by robust growth across nearly all of our end markets as well as contributions from our acquisition program, which was partially offset by the strengthening U.S. dollar.  Company booked record orders of nearly $3.450 billion, and that represented a continued positive book-to-bill of 1.1:1. We're especially pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter with operating margins reaching 20.7%, and that's 70 basis point increase from both prior year and prior quarter, and we achieved these operating results despite facing a wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges as well as the COVID shutdowns in China that Craig mentioned. Adjusted diluted EPS grew a strong 23% from prior year to a new record of $0.75, another excellent reflection of our continued strong execution. And then finally, we're very pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $543 million and $452 million respectively.  I just want to say how proud I am of our team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of Amphenol's entrepreneurial organization, who has continued to perform very well amidst a highly dynamic and challenging environment. We're very pleased to have announced in the quarter that we closed on the acquisition of NPI Solutions based in Morgan Hill, California, and with annual sales of approximately $65 million. NPI is a manufacturer of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on customers in the semiconductor equipment and test and measurement markets. The addition of NPI expands our already broad position in value-add interconnect for these important and high potential markets. As we welcome this outstanding new team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring those companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just note once again how pleased we are that our end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. No doubt about it, during these very dynamic times, that market diversification continues to create great value for the company.  The military market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 2% from prior year but were flat organically, with moderations in our sales into naval and military vehicle applications, offset by growth in space, avionics and UAVs. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels, and we continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position across the military market.  As militaries around the world continue to adopt a wide array of next-generation defense technologies, our industry-leading breadth of high-technology interconnect and sensor products positions the company strongly across all major defense programs. This gives us great confidence for our long-term performance.  The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales increased by a very strong 32% from prior year and 36% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. Sequentially, our sales grew 11% from the first quarter, which was actually much better than the expectations that we had coming into the quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, while we do expect a seasonal low double-digit sequential decline in sales, we anticipate continued and substantial growth from prior year. We're very encouraged to have driven another quarter of strength in the commercial air market, which is quite a welcome development after 2 extremely challenging years in the air travel industry. As personal and business travel continues to recover, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those planes. I'm particularly proud of our team working in commercial air, who really have persevered throughout the downturn, and we are now once again realizing the fruits of their long-term labors. Industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the second quarter. Sales in the quarter grew 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most of our industrial end markets, including especially the battery and electric heavy vehicle applications, oil and gas, medical and rail mass transit. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8% from the first quarter.  Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to roughly remain at these very robust second quarter levels. I have to say that our results this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market.  To that end, the addition of NPI Solutions further strengthens our position in the important semiconductor and test and measurement equipment interconnect markets. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this long-term strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew 23% in U.S. dollars and 29% organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, with particular strength once again in sales into electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications.  Sequentially, our sales increased by 6%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter when we had anticipated a modest sequential decline. For the third quarter, we now expect a moderate sequential decline in sales as customers continue to manage through a wide array of supply chain challenges in the global automotive market. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the important and dynamic automotive market. They continue to manage through a difficult supply chain environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts.  The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales increased by 7% in the second quarter as strength in smartphones and laptops were somewhat offset by a moderation of sales of products incorporated into tablets. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 6% versus the first quarter. Looking now into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by more than 20% compared to the second quarter levels on typical seasonal strength. I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. In particular, amidst the COVID-related disruptions in China that occurred early in the quarter, our outstanding and agile team once again delivered strong results. Most importantly, they continue to design our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And they remain, as always, poised to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically as strength from products sold to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions, more than offset a moderation of our sales to wireless equipment manufacturers.  Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter grew by a slight 1%, but that was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect to grow moderately from the second quarter levels. We're encouraged by the company's continued strength in our sales into the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world.  The information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were stronger than expected, rising by a very robust 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically from prior year. Our team really just executed well in fulfilling broad-based strength across server and networking applications, including with web service providers. Sequentially, our sales increased by 11% in the second quarter, which was better than our expectations.  Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these very strong second quarter levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Both our OEM and web service provider customers continue to drive their equipment and networks to ever higher levels of performance really in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 57% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically as broadband spending levels increased and as we benefited from our recent acquisitions. Our growth in broadband was particularly strong in North America. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a much better-than-expected 14% from the first quarter. As we head into the third quarter, we do expect sales to the broadband market to decline moderately from these levels. But we look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. As our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to even more homes and businesses, these products have become even more critical.  Now turning to the company's outlook. There's no doubt that the current market environment remains highly uncertain with ongoing supply chain and inflationary challenges as well as some continued disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming those conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the third quarter, We Expect Sales In The Range Of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent strong sales growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 12% to 15% compared to the third quarter of 2021.  I just want to say that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding Amphenol management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the marketplace and to continue to grow our market position while expanding the company's profitability. In addition, our entire organization remains fully committed to delivering long-term sustainable value, all while prioritizing the continued well-being of each of our employees around the world. And finally, and most importantly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank that entire Amphenol team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first caller is Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to better understand the guidance. I think 3Q revenue is typically up sequentially, and the company guided it down just a touch at the midpoint of guidance. I'm hoping to better understand are you seeing any slowdown in customer demand perhaps because of some of the macroeconomic conditions? Or is this more about sales coming off of a very high base and still being at a very good overall level? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Mark. I mean, look, this is a very unique year. There's no doubt about it. There's a lot of things going on. I talked about the uncertainty that is in the market. And I won't go through each of the end markets. I think I just went pretty fulsomely through our expectations. I think we have a really strong outlook here given the real strength that we saw in the second quarter, given the continued momentum that we have across the company. We see growth in a number of our end markets. And a number of our end markets, we view as having, at this point at least, the potential that they may moderate slightly. But I feel that this is a very strong guidance from a top line perspective. We have great momentum, both order momentum as well as continued strong positions with our customers. And I think that, overall, given the environment, given all what is happening in the global economy, I think this is a very strong guidance. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Congrats on a great quarter from my end as well. I guess, Adam, the question is for you. I'd love to get your perspective, there seems to be a lot of concern around the macro headwinds impacting end demand. You have talked a little bit about that as well. You tend to have a very broad perspective. You talk to a lot of customers. Are you seeing signs of softness of customers holding back orders and demand at this point given what you see in the macro side? Just anything you can talk about from your discussion with customers and anything you're seeing different in the channel versus OEM would be really helpful. Richard Norwitt : Thanks so much, Amit. Look, I think we read the papers and what's the news like everybody does. But what we really listen to is our customers. And I think you saw in the second quarter, our customers gave us still very robust orders, and we executed on the orders that we had. And thereby, we were able to deliver the upside that we did here in the second quarter. I think if I look across the end markets, if any market has some customers who are saying maybe there's a little bit of a breathing -- a little -- taking a breath, for example, and we have very strong demand in the IT datacom market. I talked about the fact that IT datacom, we expect to see a little moderation in the third quarter. And I think that's a bit of a reflection of some customers taking some breathing, so to speak, after really, really strong demand.  But have we seen broadly across areas like industrial, automotive, aerospace, impacts of the macroeconomic? I mean we really haven't at this stage. I will say this, the Amphenol team, we're not in the business, and we don't view it as our business, to try to guess where the economy is going.  Can there be one day a recession? I mean there's lots of people who are much more expert than I am who are probably going to make prognosis about that, and we won't get in the business of doing so. But what we are doing always inside our company is making sure that we're prepared either way. And I've used that term before in this forum of driving with one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. And that's just the Amphenolian way. We are going to have our foot heavy on the accelerator, capitalizing on this great backlog that we have, capitalizing on the wonderful position we've built with customers, capitalizing on the new technologies that we're enabling next-generation applications with our customers.  But we're always going to have a foot covering the brake in case we see something different coming our way. And then our general managers, 130 of them around the world, will quickly take action to adjust our resources to react to whatever dislocations can come in the marketplace and, thereby, to both preserve the financial strength of the company while ensuring that we can continue to grow our market position in any economic environment. And that's where we stand today. Is there going to be, because of the Fed or because of whatever geopolitics or because of whatever reason, some macroeconomic slowdown or some shock? We don't know. And in all honesty, we don't try to spend a lot of time wondering about that. We talk to our customers. And when we see something change, we'll react with the type of speed that everybody has been accustomed to from the Amphenolian organization. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, I was wondering if you might be able to comment on what you're seeing on the ground in China. Clearly, in the second quarter, there were lockdowns for a couple of months and then a recovery from there. But just from a demand perspective, can you maybe share any color on how those months transpired from a demand, and if you're seeing any real snapback in demand, especially in light of the view that there are some stimulus programs underway? And maybe if you can share some context on what you've seen in the past from such initiatives, how that might have benefited Amphenol? Richard Norwitt : Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. I mean, look, first and foremost, I just have to credit our team in China, I mean, in particular, those who work in and around Shanghai. Now as you know, Wamsi, we have facilities all over. We don't concentrate them in one or another city. And I have to say that, that manufacturing strategy that we have of having it be quite fragmented has been a very, very big asset for the company as these COVID lockdowns have occurred because it never happens that we're impacted in our totality or in any material sense.  But we do have several operations that operate around Shanghai. And some of our team members there, I mean, we had several of our general managers who were locked in their apartment for the better part of 3 months. And we had to operate factories in bubbles and things like that. And it was just an extraordinary, extraordinary effort and drive and, ultimately, success by our team. And I'm just so grateful to each and every one of them for making the sacrifices that they did and continuing to have the commitment to the company and to our customers. That was clearly reflected in this quarter. All that being said, I think that, ultimately, the impact of those shutdowns on our business in the second quarter was very modest, if anything, because our team was able to execute through the shutdowns. And then to the extent that any catch-up was necessary, they were able to do that over the course of the quarter as some of the more severe shutdowns abated.  We have seen strong demand, especially in areas like automotive, in the mobile market, some of the other communications markets in China and also in industrial, where we have a very strong position. And in particular, we see strength in China in anything that's being electrified. And that's been a great progress for the company. And I think we have seen some pickup in demand coming out of those shutdowns in certain of the areas.  With respect to the stimulus, I can tell you that I still remember my very first quarter as CEO, and this is taking us all back in time now because I've been CEO since January of 2009, but that was a really tough time period. Everybody will recall, I became CEO in January of 2009 at the depth of the beginning of the financial crisis. And that was when China decided to build the 3G network, and it was effectively a stimulus program that accomplished also the goal of expanding the ability of people to have mobile broadband.  And I think as they talk about stimuli today in today's economy, a lot of that also does revolve around new technologies, things like electrification of vehicles, of heavy vehicles, the build-out of other infrastructure. And so to the extent that those kind of stimulus do, in fact, come, our position across all those end markets is a very strong one. And I would expect our local team to be well poised to take advantage. Operator : And our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matthew Sheerin : Adam, I wanted to just ask -- get a little bit more color on that really strong margin expansion that you saw, 70 basis points quarter-on-quarter. You talked about pricing. You also talked about leverage. Where do we stand on pricing right now in terms of continuing to increase ASPs as your input costs go up? Or should we just expect sort of the normal margin contribution that you typically see in the business? Craig Lampo : Matt, this is Craig. Thanks for the question. Yes. No, it's a great question. I mean we're really proud of the achievement we had here in the second quarter. 20.7%, really strong operating margins. And obviously, we capitalized on the strong demand environment, but the team really did an outstanding job really navigating, I think, the environment around cost and inflation, supply chain, all of these things that clearly have put pressure on margins.  And we talked about coming into the year how we started -- have been starting to see some impact of the pricing actions that we have been taking. We had strong margins in the first quarter. We talked about coming into the second quarter here, expecting some additional traction related to pricing.  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think, at this point, coming into the second quarter, we really have, we believe, had a meaningful progress on really offsetting a good portion of the inflation and supply chain and other costs that we've seen over the past year. We do expect actually some additional progress here in the third quarter. And I think our guidance does reflect that on -- our guidance at the revenue line and being a little bit lower sequentially and our EPS being kind of basically flat, which would represent an implied continued progress on margin, which is partially due to continued pricing actions that we continue to take.  Well, where we are in that journey in terms of will we be at the end of it at the end of the third quarter? I don't necessarily know that I would say that. But I'm not sure what's going to happen with inflation. I mean that continues to be a big question mark. I mean, the cost environment continues to be very dynamic. So I think as we have done, as we will continue to do, our general managers have done an outstanding job just raising prices commensurate with the cost environment, and we'll continue to do that. And I'm really proud of the team for the progress we've already made. Operator : Next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : Could you talk a little bit more about the wireless device markets? I know you mentioned it's looking seasonal. It sounded like it's on the low end of seasonal, so from an end market standpoint. And also, can you touch on how you're looking at content this year versus maybe last year, where maybe you're doing better or different types of technologies that you're leveraging into new phones or in tablets, et cetera? Richard Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. Yes. Look, I think we've guided it to be up at least 20% here in the third quarter. The mobile devices market, it's a very hard market to predict, as you know, with any certainty 1 quarter out, let alone a month out or sometimes even a week out. There's no doubt about it, it's our most volatile of markets. And I think that's a strong guidance given the inherent volatility in the market.  I think, relative to our content, this continues to be a market where there's a lot of different devices, where every one of those devices is a bit of a jump ball, and we win -- we try to win more than we lose of the content on these devices. And I think, over time, we've successfully broadened the range of products that we sell into mobile devices to be not just antennas and interconnect but also a wide range of mechanisms and the like.  And we've also broadened the range of products that we sell into. So today, when we think about mobile devices, you talk not just about smartphones and mobile computing devices like laptops and tablets but wearables and hearables and all these various things and lots of just new devices that are technically mobile devices. And it's unbelievable, actually, the continued spread of these devices. And hopefully, we can have next year a kind of a normal consumer electronics show. And we can go to something and just see the extraordinary array of things that are there. It's actually just a really exciting market.  And so I think from a content perspective, I'd say that our team continues to accomplish their goal of maximizing their content while never being able to win everything on every platform. And I think we remain in a very strong position. And the team remains just so agile and reactive to the inherent volatility that's in that market, which gives me confidence that whatever comes along, if there's an uptick in demand or vice versa, that our organization who works in mobile devices is going to be prepared for it. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess I wanted to dig into the industrial segment a bit, Adam, if you can. I know you have a collection of different end markets in there, and you had strong growth. If you can just dig into sort of the different end markets there and if you're seeing sort of broad-based strength? Or are there any pockets where you still sort of see a recovery where it might be below sort of prepandemic levels? And just curious now that this segment is tracking more than 25% of your revenue mix on a more consistent basis, is there any change in thinking relative to sort of acquisitions, particularly if it adds exposure to the industrial -- broader industrial market further? Richard Norwitt : Thank you very much, Samik. Look, industrial has been a really strong market for us here for quite some time period. I'm just so proud of our team in industrial. If I look back, I mean, this is, I think, something like our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in industrial, and that has included some really wonderful acquisitions that we've made, both on interconnect and sensors and antennas. And today, the breadth of where we sell industrial products per se is broader than it's ever been before.  I mean if you think about where kind of industrial is, it can be everything from a high-speed train to an offshore oil platform to an alternative energy, solar farm or wind mill. It can be in heavy equipment. It can be in building architecture and HVAC systems. It can be sensing for a wide variety of things. I mean, you can imagine where you can put like a sensor and an antenna and a connector to like to check the weather, you can put these things on tall buildings all the way down to tiny bird houses. I mean you name it, there's going to be so many different places where industrial products can go.  And all along, what ties them together is this unique, harsh environment packaging of the products, be they interconnect, be they sensors, be they antennas. We think it's a great place to make acquisitions. And the fact that industrial is today something like 26-or-so percent of our sales doesn't at all give us pause because it's also our broadest, most diversified market of all of our end markets in terms of the applications and the variability of those applications. So far from it. I mean, we just completed the acquisition of NPI this last quarter.  NPI sells harsh environment, complex interconnect assemblies that are used in a very specific part of the industrial market in particular, which is the semiconductor capital equipment and the test and measurement equipment market. This is a great space to be for the long term. I mean just look at some of the legislative priorities in our country and in many others and the trends for many years into the future, that seems like a very good place to be, but so does electrification of heavy equipment. So does something like alternative energy, and all with that is entailed. And so we're very committed to the industrial market. If we see great acquisitions that come along that expand both our product technology and our position across some of these segments, we're not going to shy away from them. Operator : Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Another question, broader business but more of a company-specific standpoint. So although you're not seeing in the business, yet there are, of course, these broader signs of rising economic risks overall, other callers have highlighted. What I'm wondering, Adam, is if you could comment on your conversations with your general managers right now given the backdrop, and specifically, any contingency planning they might be doing at present for their businesses to find growth and protect earnings in what could be a more challenging environment from here? In other words, the brake side of the gas and brake dynamic that you spoke to earlier? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, thank you very much. I mean, look, we have a lot of conversations with our management team, including directly with our general managers and all of the people in the organization. And you can bet, we are always talking about this concept of one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. I mean even just this morning, we have always a discussion with our whole team at the time of our earnings. That's, by the way, why we do this call in the afternoon. It's because we have all of our management team together a date in the morning, and that's a better time for people around the globe. And you can bet that we're always reinforcing that idea that we have a strong momentum right now. Our customers want a lot of product from us. Let's execute on that. But let's keep the windshield clear so that you see ahead of you if there is a problem. And if a problem comes, I can tell you, nobody is faster to react than the Amphenolian general managers. I mean, I use this analogy like a racecar. You have a foot on the gas and a foot on the brake and you've got your eyes staring out the windshield just in case something pops along. And when that thing comes, whatever it may be, it's not for us to guess what it is, it's not for us to do something differently because of our guesswork. It's to be ready regardless. And I can tell you that all of our 130 general managers, this is second nature to the Amphenolian culture. And all of them are prepared for whatever may come along.  But at the same time, we are not sitting here saying, hey, the Fed is raising interest rates, the world is going to end. That's just not how we run the company. We don't sit back and just reflect on macro things and just say to them, well, the macro says this, so we better do that. We listen to our customers, and then we take action. And that's what our team is going to do. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Nikolay Todorov : And congrats from me as well on the strong results. Adam, a question on bookings and maybe bookings linearity. If I look at your bookings, they're stronger than your peers. I wonder if you can comment if you're seeing broad-based trend or maybe there are certain markets that are driving such a strong bookings at this point? And any color there would be helpful. Richard Norwitt : Yes. Well, look, I think our peers are doing very well, too, I think relative to our bookings. Actually, bookings across the quarter were fairly linear. It wasn't that we saw a big spike early and it tailed off later, vice versa. Actually, orders were pretty consistent across the 3 months of the quarter, which was encouraging to see actually. And relative to our end markets and the booking trends of the end markets without going sort of one by one, again, I would say that we had good strength across virtually all of our markets, especially our kind of what I refer to as our longer-cycle markets where we saw still great bookings, military, commercial air, industrial, automotive.  We saw really strong bookings in broadband as well. And I think that's a great reflection of some of the planning of broadband customers right now. We're really working on expanding the capacity and also the breadth of the networks. There's a lot going on around opening up the opportunities in rural America, for example, with broadband access. And our team is really on the front lines of supporting our customers in those initiatives.  I think the one market where, again, bookings were still strong but where maybe we started to see towards the end of the quarter a slight moderation is IT datacom. And I talked about that earlier. I think we are seeing some -- maybe in the third quarter, a little bit of digestion of the strong consumption that some of our customers have had there. We hear a little bit about touches of inventory in that space as well, which is not surprising given the extremely strong demand that we've seen in that space, but nothing of any cataclysmic variety here. I mean the IT datacom market remains very, very strong. But as we've said in our guidance, we would anticipate in the third quarter to see a little bit of a moderation there.  So overall, I think there's really strong bookings. And I got to give a call out to our salespeople around the world, they do the toughest job there is there. And it's just amazing how they continue to support customers and ultimately generate the bookings that we've seen. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. James Suva : Adam, on your prepared comments, you mentioned the auto sector, how it outperformed this quarter, which is great. But then you mentioned that you expect it to decline, I think you said moderately for the Q3 outlook. Has something changed there? Because the supply constraints have kind of been ongoing for a long time and you think that maybe we've stabilized or gotten a little bit better with those. But I'm just kind of wondering about the outperformance was fantastic, but kind of why kind of a little bit of a downtick for the outlook. Richard Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Jim. I mean one thing I would just clarify, we -- I talked about the fact that we see in the second quarter some moderation on a sequential basis, that would still reflect very strong year-over-year growth in the auto market on a year-over-year basis. I think it'd be still very strong double-digit organic growth at the levels that we've guided to. So I don't think that represents at all a slowdown in our momentum in automotive. There's some seasonality sometimes that we'll see in the automotive market. I think there are still supply chain constraints that customers are seeing. I think there were some announcements in recent days from some of the OEMs that I think reflected that. And you add all that together and it ultimately results in the outlook that we have. And if there's better opportunities, you can bet that our team is going to try to exceed that outlook. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : Congrats on the great results and outlook. And I want to address one aspect of the P&L. There was at least one question about it already. But the conversion margins were very strong in the quarter, which is pretty surprising given we'd expect some headwinds from FX and input cost inflation, which continues. And I understand that Amphenol's kind of constantly in the process of responding to these market dynamics. But did the company somehow get more ahead of these changes in the current quarter than it typically does? Or maybe the converse of that is, if you haven't and we see FX and material input costs stabilize, shouldn't we expect a somewhat elevated level of contribution margin in the next couple of quarters? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Will. I appreciate the question. Listen, as I mentioned before, we're certainly super proud of the results here in the second quarter in regards to the profitability. In regards to -- I'll parse this question now into a couple of different pieces. In regards to FX, although clearly there's translation impacts on both the top and bottom line in regards to currency, it typically doesn't have a meaningful impact on our margins. So certainly, there could be some small impacts here or there, but nothing that would call out as being a meaningful impact. So I would say, currency hasn't really impacted -- doesn't really impact our conversion as you think about it in any meaningful way.  As it relates to our pricing and input cost inflation, we've been -- we certainly had pressure. Last year, as you remember, Q1 of '21, that was kind of stepped down a bit, certainly a larger negative conversion in the first quarter of '21. And as the year progressed, as we kind of were chasing that with pricing, we were able to neutralize the incremental worsening of the inflationary environment, but I wouldn't tell you that we ever kind of got back to neutral from a Q1 '21 perspective. And I think what we're seeing is that we're seeing in the first half of this year a bit of a catch-up from the first half of last year. And that's why when I said I think that at this point we've been able to kind of offset a meaningful amount of that inflation, I mean a meaningful amount kind of that's happened over the last 12 months.  So the conversion, the strong sequential conversion you see here in the second quarter is really kind of catch up, I would say, for pricing -- for inflation that we've seen over the course of the last year, and that will continue to hopefully catch up on as we expect to here in the third quarter. So it's kind of been a journey, and pricing typically is behind cost a bit. And that's what we've seen here into '21 and coming in here into '22. But I think at this point, pricing is starting to catch up to cost, and that's really reflective of the strong conversions that you see.  Now we're not guiding here in the fourth quarter and full year. I mean we don't know what inflation is going to do and all that. But you can guarantee that our general managers are close to their costs, and they're continuing to have conversations with the customers. And if the environment continues to either level out or, ultimately, the inflation continues to increase, we're going to take the appropriate action, both on the cost and on the top line. Operator : And our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. David Kelley : You noted touches of inventory build in IT datacom. Just curious if you're seeing any signs of build in any of the pockets of industrials land. Or is the demand appetite there still strong enough to absorb the incremental order strength you're seeing? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, David. Honestly, if I look at industrial, it's very hard to get great visibility because the range of customers is just so broad. Where we do have some visibility, and obviously some portion of our industrial business is through distribution. And there, I would tell you that inventory levels are not really excessive. In fact, we've continued to see good strength, good pull-through from our distributors and healthy inventory levels across our distributors who have a little bit higher percent of industrial than they would, for example, of like IT datacom or mobile networks or automotive.  And so from that perspective, I would say we see it as healthy. But I can't tell you that we have perfect visibility to the thousands and thousands of customers that we ultimately sell to across the industrial market. What we do see in industrial is just really continued strong demand as well as in many pockets, the inability of some of our competitors to satisfy that demand and, thus, our ability to get a little bit more than our fair share of the business.  And so I think our team working in industrial across all those segments, and we talked about those earlier, I think they've done a great job of executing when demand is really strong, and we continue to do so. And that doesn't really give me a feeling that there is a lot of inventory buildup or excessive inventory buildup given that customers continue to want to take product from us.  What we're always on the lookout for is order cancellations or pushouts and things like this. We just haven't seen that in any real meaningful way, if at all. And so I think right now, we feel very good about the prospects and continued momentum in industrial. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Adam, you've used the racecar analogy a couple of times and how you keep an ear to the customer to react. So I'm curious if you could just give us a little bit of color about what some of your customers and your industrial, machinery, auto and markets you're saying about the energy issues in Europe. One of the things we've sort of started to hear ironically is that they may try to sort of produce as much as they can or as much as the supply chain will allow them to near term in advance of maybe some potentially larger issues in the winter. Are you seeing any evidence of that? Or what are they telling you? Richard Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Joe. Look, we're very sensitive to the -- all the geopolitical issues around, that includes the potential energy issues that are coming in Europe. And no doubt about it, we're putting a lot of real-time thought into what that means for ourselves and also what it means for our customers and for the end demand. We have not heard a lot of direct evidence of the behavior that you're talking about.  I mean we've heard people sort of third hand, fourth hand, like you've just said here. But I can't tell you that we've had a big flood of customers coming up and saying, \"Hey, we're going to try to produce everything while it's still warm outside.\" Could that happen? Would it surprise me? I guess it wouldn't totally surprise me. And I think there's going to be a lot of creative efforts that people are going to have to take here as we head into the winter months in Europe to offset what may very well be a very challenging energy availability and cost situation.  And I know that if I look at what our teams are doing today while it's still hot outside, there's a lot of efforts ongoing to prepare ourselves and to make sure that we are not caught kind of cold, so to speak, this winter in Europe. And that's in Germany, that's in Eastern Europe, that's to some extent in France and, to some extent, in even the U.K., Scandinavia, where maybe there will be availability, but it might be very, very expensive.  And so what are we doing right now? And you can do a lot of things actually, it turns out. Maybe there were some projects that you had to increase insulation and the ceiling of your buildings. Maybe you had some things on the shelf to put in heat exchangers in factories and things like that. Maybe you had already started construction of solar panels on certain rooftops in certain countries. All things that we've been doing and have been doing and maybe would even accelerate a little bit as we come into this year. So there's a whole host of solutions to this. Inside our company, those are going to be very, very site-specific under the purview of our general managers. It's not that we're going to make some big, dramatic kind of corporate decision about how are we going to offset the potential risk of energy availability in Europe. But you can bet that there's a lot of activities going on.  And so I can extrapolate from that, that probably our customers are doing the same. And does that mean putting inventory in place? Or does that mean taking a lot of the steps internally that one can take to insulate oneself literally and metaphorically, from the challenges? I guess that customers are going to be looking at all those options. Operator : Next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen. Joseph Giordano : So I just want to touch again on price. I mean, so you had -- obviously very strong in the quarter, driving the leverage there. And next quarter guide is for down revenues a little bit sequentially but up margins. So I guess that keeps reading out. Just curious as to like the runway of the ability to keep driving price. And if we start seeing orders start to kind of like normalize or maybe directionally moderate a bit, lead times start to normalize, like historically, when you look back, how long have you been able to drive price positive? And like what are the conditions that make that harder to do? Richard Norwitt : Joe, look, I think Craig talked a lot about this already. And what I would just add is this, I mean, we are being very thoughtful about pricing with our customers. This is a tough environment for everybody. And our first and foremost thing that we do when there's inflation is we try to offset it with cost. And I mean that's our duty as a partner to our customers around the world. And only one we can't do that do we then have to pass it on in price, and we do that in a very reasonable fashion.  So what the runway, to use your term, is I mean, it just depends on how the environment goes. We're not going to take advantage of our customers. We're not trying -- we're certainly not in the business of doing excessive measures on price. We're strong supporters of our customers, but we're also making sure that we're protecting our company and protecting the company's bottom line and taking reasonable measures, and we'll continue to do that to the extent that that's what the environment requires. Operator : And our last question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Christopher Snyder : So the business is nearly 50% bigger than it was back in 2019 before the pandemic. Just given the suddenness and magnitude of the acceleration coming out of COVID, has this led to any capacity constraints for you guys as you try to realize all of the demand that is out there in the market? Richard Norwitt : Thanks so much, Chris. And look, it's a great question to squeeze in. I mean you pointed out, I mean we are, over just a very short time period, nearly 50% bigger. And it's just an outstanding testament to the organization that they've been able to flex the company in such a difficult environment. I mean let's not forget, we're 50% bigger, which, in a normal environment, would be a challenge to increase our capacity, to expand our footprint, to hire the people, to put in place whatever equipment is necessary, to do all of that.  But to do it in a pandemic, to do it in a supply chain crisis, to do it in an inflationary environment, I think, is just the best testament to the Amphenolian entrepreneurs around the world that have made this company special. So do we see capacity constraints today? I think we've battled through them all. I mean have there been challenges over the course of these couple of years? Like you cannot imagine. I mean, really, like you cannot imagine personal, professional for everybody through the pandemic. I mean it's not for the faint of heart, but it is right down the pipe for what Amphenol general managers do every day.  I mean, every single day, every one of those 130 general managers, they're fighting so many different challenges, so many different barriers that pop in front of them. And they're not bemoaning it. They're not hiring consultants to help them manage it. They're not going to some corporate bureaucracy to sort of find the answer. They're looking at their own window and they're making it happen with their teams. And then when they need help, they come to us. We collaborate across the company. We deal with it. We work the problem.  And I think the result speaks, in my mind, for itself. Through those challenges, through all the tribulations here of these recent years to expand the company by 50% -- or close to 50% is something that I think our team is really justified to be proud of. And I appreciate you bringing that up here at the end.  Well, I think that is our last question. And so with that, I'd really like to wish everybody a great finish to the summer. I hope all of you get a little bit of chance to spend some time with your family and, hopefully, enjoying some of this wonderful weather that we've been having here in Connecticut. And we look forward, Craig and I, to speaking with all of you here in just another 90 days. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thanks, everybody. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Until that, you remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2022 conference call. Our third quarter 2020 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year -- during this call is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $3.29 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. Third quarter sales were up 17% in U.S. dollars, 21% in local currencies and 18% organically compared to the third quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were up by 5% in U.S. dollars, 7% in local currencies and 6% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.151 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.96:1. Year-to-date, our book-to-bill remains strong at 1.07 to 1, and the company continues to have a robust order backlog. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $681 million and $693 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.7% and 21%, respectively, in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and was flat sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the third quarter included $12 million of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of '21 and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the significantly higher sales volumes as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the increase in operating margin reflected strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes. Given the continuing dynamic overall cost and supply chain environment, we are very proud of the company's operating performance. Our team's ability to effectively manage through the myriad of challenges around the world is a direct result of the company's entrepreneurial culture, which continues to foster a high-performance, action-oriented management team. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of '21. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $794 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically and segment operating margin was 26.1%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.518 billion, an increase by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.5%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $983 million and increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 23% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 23.1%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 22.2% and 24.5% in the third quarter of '21, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was a record $0.80 in the third quarter, an increase of 19% compared to $0.67 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $0.80, an increase of 23% compared to $0.65 in the third quarter of 2021. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continues to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was a record $576 million or 116% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $457 million or 92% of adjusted net income. Given our continued strong top line growth, we are pleased to see cash flow yield remain at these strong levels in the third quarter. From a working capital standpoint, days sales outstanding and payable days were 71 and 56 days, respectively, both within our normal range. And despite the continued challenging supply chain environment, our inventory days were 83 days, which came down in the third quarter and were also within our normal range. We are very pleased with our organization's strong management of working capital. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.21 from the previous $0.20 per share, effective for payments beginning in January 2023. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $72. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the third quarter of 2022 was $289 million. Total debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, and net debt was $3.5 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion, which included a cash, cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Third quarter 2022 EBITDA was $806 million, and at the end of the third quarter of '22, our net leverage ratio is 1.1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense and currency impacts. Due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense has increased primarily as a result of our floating Greek commercial paper, which had a balance of $904 million and represented approximately 19% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. Due to the significant increase in interest rates over the last several months, we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $38 million, which is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance. Based on current debt balances as well as current and near-term projected rate increases, we expect quarterly 2023 interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Regarding currency and the significant continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter, we expect currency to have a negative sequential sales impact of approximately one percentage point and a year-over-year negative impact of five percentage points, assuming current rates. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I certainly hope that all of you are having an enjoyable fall. Here we are in beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, with the leaves turning a wonderful autumn hue. I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements. I'll then spend a little time to discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. And then finally, I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022. And of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. Turning to the third quarter. Our results in the third quarter were much stronger than expected and exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew a very strong 17% in U.S. dollars and 21% in local currencies, reaching a new record of just under $3.3 billion.  On an organic basis, sales increased by 18%, with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. The company booked orders of $3.151 billion, representing a book-to-bill, as Craig mentioned, of 0.96 to 1. I would say that despite this slightly negative book-to-bill, the company's order backlog remains very robust. We are pleased to deliver strong profitability in the quarter, with adjusted operating margins reaching 21.0%, a 70 basis point increase from prior year and a 30 basis point increase from prior quarter. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of operational, inflationary and supply chain challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 23% to a new record of $0.80, and just really an excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution here in 2022. Finally, the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $576 million and $457 million, respectively, here in the third quarter. I just want to say how proud I am of our entire organization around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of Amphenol's entrepreneurial team as we continue to perform well amidst what is no doubt a very dynamic and challenging environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Integrated Cable Assembly Holdings, or ICA, in September, based in North America and with annual sales of approximately $90 million. ICA manufactures a broad array of cable assemblies for a diversified range of applications, particularly in the industrial market. This acquisition further expands our offering of high-technology value-added interconnect products in the industrial market. As we welcome this outstanding new team to the company, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. Importantly, and I've mentioned this many times before, our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while also exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. And these are both very important benefits, in particular, in today's dynamic market environment. I would also just mention that in the third quarter, each of our eight end markets grew organically and some of them in double digits organically. So starting with the military market. That market represented 9% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market grew 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically, which was a bit lower than our expectation heading into the quarter. On an organic basis, growth in space-related, ground vehicles and avionics applications was offset by moderations of sales of products used in communications, rotorcraft and engine applications. Sequentially, sales declined by just about 1%. As we look into the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit sequential sales increase in the military market. And for the full year 2022, we now expect a low single-digit increase in sales from last year's levels. We continue to be very pleased with the strength of the company's broad position in the defense electronics market. As militaries around the world increase their adoption of a wide array of next-generation technologies in the face of what is no question an increasingly volatile geopolitical landscape, our team managing our leading range of interconnect and sensor products continues to position the company strongly for the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew a very strong 36% versus prior year and 42% organically, driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Compared to the second quarter, our sales declined just a slight 1%, which was actually better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline in sales versus the third quarter levels. But for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase a very strong 30% compared to prior year. Our team is justifiably proud to have now realized four consecutive quarters of strong growth in the commercial air market, a clear sign of their resilience and of the continued recovery in the global air travel industry. Going forward, we look forward to benefiting from the company's strong interconnect and sensor technology positions across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems being integrated into those airplanes. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales increased by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Our growth was broad-based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including battery and heavy electric vehicles, factory automation, alternative energy, heavy equipment, medical, oil and gas, and building automation. Sequentially, our sales actually increased by 2% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest sequential sales decline. And for the full year 2022, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales from prior year. Our results in the industrial market this quarter confirm once again that our outstanding global team working in this important market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of the exciting industrial electronics market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us well to capitalize on the many technology revolutions happening across the industrial market. To that end, the addition of ICA further strengthens our position across a number of exciting segments within this important end market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 37% organically, driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications and particularly strong growth once again in sales to electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by approximately 20% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next-generation electronics and electrical systems being integrated into cars. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage well through a challenging overall environment, all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. Our continued outperformance is a direct result of their excellent efforts. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter, and our sales to customers in this market increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. And this was driven by strong growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones, wearables and laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 43%, driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve.  As we have seen periodically in the past, we do believe that some small portion of this robust demand in the third quarter may have been pulled forward from the fourth quarter. Accordingly, we expect a low double-digit sequential decline in sales from these strong third quarter levels. For the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from our strong 2021.  I'm very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market, as they continue to execute strongly in the face of an ever dynamic demand for our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms that are integrated into a wide range of next-generation mobile devices. And no question that this team remains poised as always, to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise here in 2022 or beyond. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 19% versus prior year and 15% organically as growth in our sales to mobile service providers was only partially offset by a moderation of sales to equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 9%, which was better than our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit sequential sales reduction after our very strong third quarter. And for the full year 2022, sales are expected to grow in the high single digits. We're encouraged by our strengthening performance in the mobile networks market. As operators continue to ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment in networks around the world. The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the third quarter rose from prior year by 16% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was driven by increased demand for products in servers and networking applications, and that was only partially offset by some declines in storage-related products. Sequentially, our sales did decline by 3%, albeit better than our expectation coming into the quarter. We believe that this begins to reflect some of the expected inventory corrections that we've discussed in the past by our IT datacom customers. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect a low double-digit decline in sales from these third quarter levels as customers continue to moderate their demand and adjust their inventory levels. For the full year 2022, however, we expect very strong high-teens sales growth compared to prior year.  We remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done just an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers, who continue to drive their equipment and networks towards ever higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the third quarter. Sales in this market increased by a very robust 65% in U.S. dollars and 46% organic, as we experienced strong demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 2%, which was better than our expectation coming into the third quarter. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase moderately from these strong third quarter levels. And for the full year 2022, we expect sales to increase by more than 50% from prior year, and that includes both robust organic growth as well as the benefit of acquisitions. We look forward to continuing to support our broadband service provider customers around the world with our expanded range of high-technology products. These products have become even more critical as our customers increase the bandwidth and capacity of their networks to support the expansion of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And this is in certain cases, and furtherance of government-funded programs to expand broadband. Now turning to our outlook. There is no doubt that the current economic environment remains highly uncertain and increasingly dynamic. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.09 billion to $3.15 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 4% to 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Our fourth quarter guidance represents also an expectation for full year sales of $12.474 billion to $12.534 billion and full year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.95 to $2.97. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS growth of 15% and 19% to 20%, respectively. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow our market position while driving strong profitability. In addition, I just have to say that the entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity here to thank each and every 1 of our Amphenolian team members around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Thank you very much for taking question. In terms of the comments about a more challenging and dynamic environment that the company is expecting, is that more observing that there's the potential for business conditions to deteriorate given macroeconomic factors or is that consistent with the recent moderation in incoming orders that Amphenol has already seen in the third quarter and perhaps has continued or even accelerated in the fourth quarter to date? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Mark. Look, I think that we've talked before, first about orders that positive book-to-bills don't always grow to the sky. And so it was not surprising. It wasn't certainly surprising to us that our orders moderated a bit in the quarter, and we had a slightly negative book-to-bill. We still have built tremendous backlog over the recent quarters. At the same time, I think it's fairly clear that we are in a world where, economically, there are more cross currents. And those crosscurrents can always have an impact on markets that we serve. And I think some of our customers, in particular, in places like IT datacom, who are a little bit reacting to, as I talked about, the inventory position, that would be an example of a place where maybe customers have put a little more conservatism in their balance sheet. I think we saw also in industrial with our guidance, we've had very, very strong performance in industrial and maybe there's a little bit -- a few signs of some hesitation across a few customers in that area. But it's not like we're seeing anything that anybody else isn't seeing here. We're not projecting anything, but I think the world is volatile. Just look how it's reflected in the interest rate environment, the currency markets that Craig discussed earlier, and as always, in a market like that, it's not our job at Amphenol to try to guess whether there is going to be a recession 1 day or otherwise. But it is our job, and it's our track record to always be prepared regardless. And I've talked about this in the past. You've heard me say the term that we drive with 1 foot on the gas and 1 foot on the brake. And I can tell you, we're driving hard in both respects, doing everything we can to make sure that we're there for our customers, satisfying their demand, and we did that in a big way here in the third quarter, shipping nearly $3.3 billion in sales. But for those areas where we have seen real-time feedback from customers that they may need a little bit less of our product, you can bet that those 130 Amphenol general managers, the ones who may see some softening of demand, that they're rapidly adjusting their resources. They're rapidly taking all the steps that an Amphenol General Manager does take to be prepared to preserve the company's financial strength in that environment. So we're never going to try to guess when that recession is coming. We'll let lots of people, who are much more experts at that than we are, to do that. But we will always be prepared and there's no question that we are today. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you for taking questions. I guess, Adam, I had a sort of a similar question, but more relative to your sort of performance here. When I go back and look at the last four quarters or so, every time you've reported a revenue number, you've guided sequentially the next quarter to be slightly slower, slightly lower in terms of revenue. And nevertheless, you've sort of executed above that number. And particularly through this year, you've continued to sort of ramp revenue sequentially as well. What's changing now when we look into December, we're seeing a similar trend in terms of you trying to probably bake in some of the macro in terms of the guidance for the December quarter, again, being sequentially lower in terms of revenue than September? But what's changing probably relative to the first 3 quarters of the year when we've seen sort of the execution being very different or maybe the industry conservatism that you baked in hasn't really come through? Maybe help me understand that. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. No, thank you very much, Samik. Listen, we always come out of the quarter and we try to give our best estimate of what the next quarter is going to be on behalf of everybody here. And it's a credit to our team that we've been able to outperform that, and you can bet that we're always going to try to outperform that. But it's not -- I mean, we do our best job here of doing that. And we shouldn't -- you shouldn't just say, well, Amphenol is conservative and they're naturally going to beat it. I mean there's no doubt that the world, as we see it from a macro and market standpoint, it is more dynamic. There are pockets -- more pockets of uncertainty. There are macro dynamics that are going on now. But all that being said, the underlying electronics revolution that has for us, always been a great platform for our outperformance. This continues to go unabated. Our position, our technology position continues to be broader than ever before. We've made 20 acquisitions since the beginning of 2019, each of which have added to our company in new capabilities, in new breadth, new access to customers in new geographies. So our company is well positioned to capitalize if there are opportunities for upside. And we'll certainly seek to take advantage of any of those that do come, but in the context that it is a world today that is clearly more uncertain than it was before. And I don't have to, I think, tell everybody here on the phone that you can get that by looking just at the front page of the Wall Street Journal on a daily basis. Are we always going to try to outperform what we are, but I'm not going to tell you that this quarter is the same as every other quarter that we're always going to outperform, and we're going to beat our guidance by as much as we did last quarter. We're going to work really hard to do that all the time, and we're going to navigate whatever environment comes our way. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So margins have realized a pretty nice sequential improvement both over the last 2 quarters. I know at least part of that is price cost catch-up. What is the expectation on price cost into Q4 and early 2023 to the extent you have visibility on price in the backlog and where inventory costs are running at? And kind of with that, does the guided drop in Q4 operating margins really just reflect the volume deleverage into the fourth quarter? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the question. No, we're really proud actually of the performance, both obviously here in the second quarter from a profitability, but certainly in the third quarter here, reaching 21%, matching our previous record that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 and clearly, a very different cost environment. I mean, since the fourth quarter of '18, we've kind of had a pandemic. We've had supply chain challenges. We had a lot of inflation. We have energy costs. I mean you name it. And regardless of all that, I think we've been able to navigate that very well and just capitalize also on the strong demand environment and ultimately, be able to get our margins back up to kind of this level, I think, is just a testament to the overall management team. I would say that as we finished the third quarter, and I kind of said that similar to last quarter, I think we have offset a meaningful amount of kind of this inflation and supply chain-related cost pressures. I -- we certainly -- the management team has done a great job with that in managing kind of all elements of costs while continuing to kind of adjust price commensurate to the cost inflation. When we can't offset these with other actions, clearly, that's our priority to be able to do that within the bounds and the walls of the -- of our facilities, but we can't always do that. So you have to raise prices sometimes to your customers. And I think we've done a good job of all of that. In addition, I would tell you that I'm really proud that our team has continued to manage our cost structure even in these periods of robust growth. As you can see in our operating expenses and others that we've been able to really leverage that as we continue to grow and not necessarily just add resources and add costs with that robust growth. And I think that also puts us in a very strong position regardless of what the demand environment might be, whether it be robust or not robust. As we look into the fourth quarter, I would say that the incremental or the decrementals that we see kind of coming into the fourth quarter is based on our guidance is generally normal. I'd say it's within the range of our decrementals. It isn't anything more than that. So I wouldn't read anything into kind of those decrementals at all. I think the -- we still expect strong profitability given the revenue levels here in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our guidance. Obviously, interest expense is having a little bit of pressure from an I perspective into the fourth quarter sequentially. But ultimately, operating margins, I think, continue to be very strong. I'm not going to necessarily kind of guide here to '23 in terms of operating margins, but what I could tell you is I do feel good about, again, as I said before, the overall performance of the team in being able to ultimately drive our incrementals at that 25% plus kind of operating leverage that we talk about and then ultimately, also being able to protect the bottom line, if the case may be that demand does drop in certain areas. And -- but ultimately, I feel pretty good about the profitability and certainly very proud of the team and their ability to achieve these record levels again. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Gavin Kennedy : Hi. This is Gavin Kennedy on for David Kelley. Your growth in the auto end market continues to be robust. Can you tell us how you're thinking about auto demand in the next 12 months? And are you seeing any signs of customers changing their buying habits? And then any insight into the inventory dynamics here would be great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Gavin. Look, we're really proud of the automotive performance here. I mean, if you just look over several quarters, we've had real strong double-digit organic growth in automotive now for eight quarters in a row, which is really excellent and clearly outperforming. I think that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen strong growth being driven by, in particular, everything related to electrification, but not exclusively that.  We've also seen robust growth and everything related to passenger connectivity, to safety, new electronic systems in cars, all this sort of extraordinary array of content that's being put into this generation and next generation of cars that has created a great opportunity for Amphenol. Both together with our interconnect products, our sensors, our antennas and that entire array of what we broadly refer to as interconnect products. In terms of the behavior of the customers and the outlook over the next 12 months, I mean it's hard for me to give kind of an outlook for the next 12 months. I think others have a better sense of what -- whatever the industry outlook will be, what inventories are both at dealerships and in the supply chain. But -- and for us, what's more important is the content that we see with customers, which continues to grow. In terms of inventories, I couldn't tell you that we have a perfect sense of what the inventories are with our customers, either at the end customers or at the OEM or in the supply chain. But we haven't seen real indications of abnormalities. And so orders continue to be at a good level. We continue to have strong performance and customers seem to want really a lot of our products as we saw in the third quarter. And as would be implied in our guidance also in the fourth quarter, which would make the full year of 2022 just a really exceptional year in automotive on the back of a year in 2021, which was itself also quite strong. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess -- my question is around the calendar '22 performance, the midpoint achieved in December. You would end up being about 15% top line growth, give or take organically. And I think 1 of the peers, Adam, everyone has a lot of this growth is driven by inventory build that looks like to reverse in a more pronounced manner into '23. I know you don't track this quantitatively, but maybe qualitatively, you can talk about, when you think about the growth you've achieved in '23, how does that you think in end market and share gain driven versus inventory build that might start to reverse and if you've seen any of that happen? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Amit. Listen, I think we've talked about inventory in the IT datacom market, and that's already having some impact here in the third and the fourth quarter. If I look at the overall interconnect market, taking really broadly our position, I mean, it's clear that we are outperforming and not just outperforming the sort of GDP or end market, but outperforming our peers.  And so when you think about the question of inventory, unless you are giving your customers a specific reason, a specific reason to build more inventory of your products then your outperformance should certainly not be a reflection of that inventory. And so I don't know what inventories we have in our -- amongst our customers. We have a sense of it in distribution. And there, I will tell you that it's relatively healthy. Nobody is ringing alarm bells in our distribution channel about inventory levels.  But if you look at our outperformance, unless we had created specifically problems that customers were trying to remedy by building buffer stock over problems, that would certainly not be a result of inventory. And I would tell you that over the course of the last 4 quarters, if not more, we have been solving problems for customers, not creating them. And so I personally think, in a qualitative fashion, as you said as the question qualitatively, that it doesn't fit with me that our outperformance would be and all related to an inventory build. Now is the overall market having some piece of inventory build, that may very well be, but I think that when you look at our overall performance at roughly 15%, as you say, organic growth expectation for the year compared to an industry and industry peers, who are quite a bit below that, you would probably come away thinking to quite a bit of that to share gains. But that's not a scientific assessment, because you didn't for one, I couldn't give you one. But I think qualitatively, I feel like we've made a lot of progress as a company. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I had a question on the auto queue, but I'll save that for off-line. I was wondering if you could talk about the acquisition a little bit more in terms of how it fits in with all the other cable assembly acquisitions you've done. And specifically, this one how you expect to grow it and where the margins are versus where you would like to see them. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve. I'm glad you asked about ICA. It's really a great company. And you mentioned all the cables, some of the acquisitions we've done. I mean, if I think back since 2019, we've done 20 acquisitions since that time, about five of those acquisitions were kind of diversified cable assembly acquisitions. I think we've made like three center acquisitions. We've made four fiber optics acquisitions. We've made six acquisitions of just connector companies. We've had one MilAero value-add company, one automotive, and that sort of makes up the 20. And each of those really helps us to broaden our position with customers, expanding our capability and making sure that we can cover every corner of the electronics industry on a worldwide basis. And ICA really goes towards all of those. ICA is a North America-based company, which I think is a very opportune thing right now. They have factories across the U.S. as well as in Mexico, servicing a real diversified range of applications across primarily the industrial market. Everything from electrified industrial vehicles to types of things that are used in factories, factory automation, to instrumentation, and I could go on and on and on because it's a very fragmented and diversified customer base. And what they bring us really is a real local presence close to customers where sometimes value-add interconnect proximity can be a real asset actually. Because if you're in an area where there's a lot of companies building things, designing things, and you can be their sort of neighbor and supporter and partner, that allows you to get in very early in the design cycle. And then if you have the breadth of Amphenol, if you have the access to low-cost manufacturing, low-cost sourcing of Amphenol, all of a sudden, you can turn that early involvement into a perpetuity and a strong long-term partnership. And that's something that we at Amphenol have been very successful in, in the past whenever we bought companies that maybe have a really nice proximity to a certain customer base, but a customer base who themselves is also globalizing. Not to mention the last thing, I'll say about ICA is, it's just great people. I mean, our company is made up of individuals, general managers around the world, who are entrepreneurs. And every time we bring in a company like an ICA, I'm just really amazed by the strength and the character and the entrepreneurship of the individuals that have joined as part of Amphenol. And I think at ICA, that's certainly the case. And we look forward to growing with customers where they're a little stronger than we were, to bring them into new customers, to helping them on connector technology, where we have a lot more to offer to give them a more total solution to customers and on and on. I mean there's so many levers of value that you have in these acquisitions, and we fully intend to take advantage of as many of them as possible with the team at ICA. Operator : The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Yeah. Thanks for taking question. Maybe a bit of a bigger picture structural question. Adam, just wondering, is there anything inherent in the new segment structure of the company that could help with the margin? I'm thinking versus past cycles. If we do, in fact, go into a broader macro downturn, especially anything anecdotally, I think it would be helpful to illustrate the dynamic. I'm thinking enabling shared resources, identifying growth opportunities or things similar to that. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Luke. Look, I talked about this early in the year when we announced the evolution of our organization into the three divisions, which are now our reportable segments with three division presidents. And for us, it's all about the scalability of that unique entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol, whereby today, we have 130 general managers around the world. And what's really important in times of crisis, and also in good times, by the way, is those 130, they don't just operate in a vacuum. They don't -- yes, every day, you have a general manager, who's running his or her business, reacting in real time to what customers are telling them, reacting in real time to what's happening in the environment, whether it be the supply chain or how technology is evolving or whatever.  But also, they're working closely with our group general managers, who -- now we have 12 of those group general managers, who then work today with those division presidents to make sure that we're stimulating collaboration in real time to make sure that we're sharing best practices and information in real time, to make sure that we're cooperating with customers in real time, to bring to those customers the full suite of products. So in a time like this, the fact that now instead of just having one CEO doing that last year, that today, we have three division presidents, who are doing that on a much more active basis. They have three times as much time in their day by definition, as I have in my day, it means that we can have an even richer real-time reactivity to changes and dynamics that come in the marketplace. And that means opportunities, our ability to capitalize on them, our ability to migrate resources quickly towards those opportunities, it also means when there are challenges, how do we quickly react? How do we give support to those who sometimes have to do really tough things. Cutting cost is not a hard thing. It requires an enormous amount of moral support and time and discussion. And that kind of iteration and that interaction is just much more rich today with our three divisions than it was when it was just me with the seven groups that we had going into the end of this year. And so it's part of scaling the company, which has always been, as you know, one of my greatest priorities is to preserve the culture of Amphenol and then to ensure its scalability. Well, part of that scalability is making sure that when the next downturn comes along, we're just as prepared for it, and we have just the same ability to react positively as we've done in the past. And I think we've demonstrated for more than two decades that in difficult times, Amphenolians rise to the occasion immediately and deliver superior results. Whether that was in the bursting of the Internet bubble 20 years ago plus, whether that was in the global financial crisis, whether that was during the pandemic. In each of those times, the fact that our margins were down by just 300 basis points was a distinct and clear reflection of that culture, manifesting itself in that reactivity. And so the perpetuation of that culture, the scaling of that culture is really what this is all about. And so no doubt about it. I think in the big picture, that new divisions that -- those segments, as we talk about them publicly, that will clearly support the company to continue to do what we've always been known for. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yeah. Thank you so much. I was wondering, Adam, if you could elaborate maybe a little bit on the pull forward comment you made on mobile devices. You had expected, obviously, to grow sequentially at a much slower rate. You did report very strong sequential growth. Maybe talk about the cadence of orders and why do you think that happened in the quarter? And if I could, if you could just maybe give us some sense of what you're seeing in China since you have such a good view into the region? If you'd characterize it maybe as things being stable or getting worse or getting better, that would be great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Sure. Thanks so much, Wamsi. Well, it's two questions, but I will say they're a little bit related, and let me say why. Look, if you look at our mobile devices market, it's been, as always, 1 of our most volatile markets. And I think if you go back over the last decade, we've had at least two fourth quarters, which were down in the kind of mid- to high teens on a sequential basis. So our outlook for this quarter being down sequentially low double digits, it's not a foreign concept to us that once in a while, you'll have a fourth quarter that will be down. I mean what we always think about in mobile devices, the one sure thing, and that's in a market where there are very few sure things is that the second half typically is quite significantly above the first half. And here, our guidance would imply that in the second half, we're still up north of 30% in the second half compared to the first half. So very robust and relatively normal kind of feel between the first and the second semester of 2022.  I did mention that the -- we saw -- at the end of the quarter, really, a very strong demand in mobile devices pulls from customers. And why was that? You could come up with a number of different theories. I mean my own theory is that if you think about mobile devices, which are still today primarily manufactured in China, there was not only just holidays in China, but there were some other events going on over the last -- over the first few weeks of October in China. And it wouldn't surprise me if maybe some customers were preparing for both those holidays as well as the various political meetings that happened in the country, and that may have led to a little bit of pull forward, as I alluded to, and that is also reflected in this guidance. I mean, look, relative to China, I think it's a tale of two cities here. One is, if you read the papers and if you watch everything, obviously, at the highest levels of the government, there's a lot of tension. And you would be blind not to recognize that there's a lot of political tension. There's various policies being enacted by the U.S. and there's various things that are happening in China that are all interpreted in that way, that there is some tension. At the same time, on the street, on the ground, it is pretty stable and kind of business as usual. We haven't seen funny things happening that 1 would sort of fear over the last few years. Our operations are running really great, and we continue to make great progress with local customers who need our technologies. And I think it comes back to something I've talked about in the past, which is that we operate globally as a local company everywhere that we operate. If you think about it, we're in 40 or more countries around the world. And each of our operations of those countries is run by general managers, who are from that place. And they run their business as if it was a local business, albeit with the backdrop of support, the resources and the capabilities and the breadth of a global Amphenol. And nowhere is that more true than in China, where our entrepreneurial management team there has just done a phenomenal, phenomenal job of making sure that customers know that they get local support, from local teams, local engineers, local quality engineers. This is not ex patriots. This is not us taking American technology and porting it over there to support. It is all locally developed and locally supported. And thus, in their times of need, our customers come to us when we can solve their problems. And that's what they do in the world over. And so while the headlines in the papers are what they are, I can tell you that on the ground, our team continues to operate very effectively and successfully across China. The one last thing I'll say, I'm sure in your question about China is embedded a question maybe about how COVID is going there. I'm just so proud of how our team has navigated the restrictions that were associated with zero COVID over the course of this year. Those were much more acute towards the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter, in particular in Shanghai, where our team just did a fabulous job. But there are still occasionally some little restrictions that are popping up. And our team has a fabulous playbook for it. And we don't have all our eggs in one basket anywhere in the world, and that includes in China. And so we have a very diversified and broad set of facilities around the country, such that we're not susceptible to a total impact if 1 place has a shutdown or another. So I would say it's very stable. I certainly hope that the world's governments can all get along. That's something that I personally hope for all of our sakes, but for Amphenol's position in China, we remain very robust, and we're very confident of the future. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. I have a question about strategy for either Adam or Craig. With interest rates higher and Craig gave some good details about interest expense that we should model for Q4 and going forward. I didn't know if that included any additional Fed raise next month or not. But the bigger strategy question is, does this make it so your use of capital you are looking to pay down debt a little bit more or higher returns on capital versus how you look at M&A or stock buybacks a little more, you start to balance things a little bit differently with higher interest rates, but just let us know about strategically if it impacts things at all in your decision tree. Thank you. Craig Lampo : Thanks, Jim. Yeah, I would say that our overall kind of capital deployment strategy, we certainly have talked about many times in the past. And certainly, over the last number of years, it's been in the lower interest rate environment, but we've had a similar capital deployment strategy over many different interest rate environments over the years. And it really has been consistent, and it's really resulted in what we believe to be a great return of investment to our shareholders. And in the strategy, kind of advise strategy before has been flexible and how it's executed over time depending on the economic and market conditions is in balance in regards to ensuring that we're deploying capital towards our M&A strategy, which really we believe provides the best return in our return of capital to shareholders, and that's both our dividend program and the return of repurchase program -- share repurchase program. And I would say, given that kind of strong free cash flow generation that we've had over the years that I can say with confidence is that really the rising interest rate environment really won't impact our overall capital deployment strategy. And I would say in any real meaningful way. I mean we continue to look to deploy that half of our free cash flow towards M&A over time, in that other half towards that return of capital to shareholders. And if opportunities that are more significant in acquisitions, we're certainly going to adjust that towards those acquisitions in a fast and flexible manner. And I think that we do generate a lot of free cash flow, and we certainly expect to continue to do so. So I wouldn't say that really the interest rate environment is going to change that. I think debt paydown is certainly something that we would do if some of those other levers just certainly M&A and otherwise, just isn't available to us. And we have been able to kind of maintain and in certain cases, pay down debt over time anyways, even giving all those different actions that we take. So I wouldn't say that the current environment has really changed the way we think about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thanks so much. Adam, I was wondering if you could comment just broadly given the macro and all this uncertainty, whether you're seeing any widening of the acquisition funnel or maybe any loosening of evaluations as sellers might get more skittish or it doesn't remain to, I guess, the world it was or valuation that was. And if I could sneak in just a quick housekeeping. Would the book-to-bill have still been negative without FX movements? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. So I think just your little housekeeping question, I think -- I don't think it would have changed the book-to-bill with FX. Look, relative to M&A and the funnel, and we have a great pipeline of acquisitions. As I mentioned, over -- since the beginning of 2019, we've closed 20 deals through quite a cycle, I will say. I mean if you think about the cycle in which we've done that, this has been quite a cycle. And I think the compelling story of joining the Amphenol organization being part of something that is really special. It's something that we continue to tell to companies around the world, and we continue to find good reception to that. Does it become a kind of a buyer's market, for example, are sellers a little more skittish and were willing to sell. I'd be a little careful about in kind of overestimating the impact of the macro on the decision-making of sellers, many of whom are making the one decision in their life to do this. So in my experience, sellers are not kind of looking at what the S&P 500 is doing. They are looking at what the 10-year treasury is doing or looking at what FX rates are doing in that moment. When they think about selling, should they sell, should they not sell, and at what value. Can it impact on the margin, the current environment, what others are willing to pay for deals, and we're a very financially strong company. Maybe that could. I would hope that there's good reason among the universe of buyers around valuations. But we don't normally see just because macro shifts, a dramatic change in the M&A landscape. We have a fabulous funnel. We have a fabulous track record. We have a fabulous organizational culture that's really attractive to companies. I think all of those things will serve us well and will ensure that over the long term, we'll continue to find great companies become part of Amphenol. And I'll continue to be completely unable to predict when that's going to happen. But we're happy to have gotten one deal done here this quarter, and I'm confident over the long term we'll have some more. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from William Stein with Truist. You may go ahead. William Stein : Thank you for taking my question. Adam, I don't normally ask about -- I guess it doesn't normally get a ton of attention, the broadband end market, but the growth has been very strong and for a while now. I wonder if you can comment as to longer-term trends here. We've heard some other component suppliers talk about this end market looking strong for more than just a couple of quarters. We hear about cable MSOs and carriers making pretty significant spending commitments. And I wonder if you're seeing that dynamic and whether that's reflected in really substantial backlog there or if that might be overstating things. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks for the question. And look, I'm really happy to talk about the broadband market. It's always been a core for Amphenol even if there's been a few challenging years as the sort of operators in broadband were merging and buying each other and waiting for certain technologies to come. And with all that consolidation and that kind of waiting period, there was a relatively flat kind of investment in the broadband market. And what I think we've seen this year with the real spike up of our performance in this space and can only be termed out. If you look at where we are today on a run rate basis, we're more than 50% higher than we were a year ago. And over the last kind of three-four years, it was running at a relatively stable pace on a quarterly basis, broadband, and now it's at quite a higher level. And I think it's a reflection of really one thing, the extraordinary expansion of data traffic in the world and the necessity of operators to work to support that. I mean, think about all the things that we do on a given day. And there's rarely a minute that goes by where you're not somehow using some data somewhere and creating traffic. I'm going to give a little shout out, because I have a new baby niece, who my little brother had his first child just a few days ago, and I have spent more time on face time, looking at this beautiful young thing, whose name is Chloe. I have spent more time looking at this beautiful thing on real-time video over the last six days, then I think I have face timed ever in my life. I mean it's extraordinary. And the fact that you can sit in Connecticut and you can look on an iPad, and you can be looking at a baby that was born not very few minutes before that. And you can be experiencing that with the richness. Sure, you're not there, you don't smell the baby. You don't see everything around it. But you can actually see the thing that is there in all of her beauty. I mean, that is a sign to me of a world that demands a lot of broadband. And so what is that going to be in the future? Is there some momentum in the spending? I think there is some momentum here. There's also a lot of government funding. Let's not forget, I mean, a lot of this infrastructure bill here in the U.S. and there are other countries doing the same, has focused on the fact that there's a whole subset of the world who doesn't get to do what I just described, because they live in areas that don't have access to rural broadband. I mean, broadband is a utility. It's a necessity. It's in many ways a human right. And I think governments of the world have woken up to the fact that if you don't provide that access to people regardless of if they live 10 miles from the nearest paved road in the middle of Kansas or if they live in Manhattan, then you're not really enabling people to live a full life. And that -- we're really proud of what we do in the broadband space. And we've always stuck it out even when the spending wasn't growing. And I'm just so happy for our team and proud of our team that they are there today to enable the growth and the investments that are happening with our customers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano with Cowen. You may go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hey, thanks again here. Good afternoon, everyone. I know we all appreciate like the beauty of Amphenol is like when 1 part of your business is doing well. So 1 part is doing weaker, one is doing stronger and it kind of balances the other out. But if we were to like normalize for the size of the relative end markets you have, is there -- can you kind of like which parts are the -- have the most impact on your margins if you were to normalize for size? Like if there was something to be down, which would be the last one you'd want to be down, if you were to kind of think about it that way? Craig Lampo : Joe, thanks for the question. I actually wouldn't really call out any market that really has significantly lower margins. I mean some have lower gross margins, but then lower SG&A, and we talked about the structure being a little bit different depending on the market. But from an operating margin perspective, honestly, I wouldn't say that there's much of a significant difference. I mean, you see that there's some differences in our operations. Our segments have a little bit of a difference. But from a market perspective, I really wouldn't call that out. I mean broadband, which is really some -- it used to be more the cable business, and it really isn't only the cable business anymore, because some of the acquisitions we've done in that space that's really broadened our portfolio out in that market. And it's actually somewhat of the reason why we've seen some of this big growth historically was lower margin, but I wouldn't even call that out as some of this big growth has been -- having lower margins associated with it. So long-winded answer to your question is, I really wouldn't call out any particular markets. Operator : And our last question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Thanks, Adam and Craig for all the details so far. My final question here is just on the aerospace market, where you've had some nice momentum over the last few quarters, still below where you were pre pandemic, but it looks like you've got really strong backlog. So could you talk about the momentum you're seeing there, Adam, and the content opportunity going forward? Adam Norwitt : For sure, Matt, and thanks so much. It's a great last question. Look, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, just how proud I am of our team working in this market. It is not easy. Let me tell you, it is not easy to be servicing a space, an end market and to have that end market drop by as much as it did in the case of broadband. And let alone to do it well, some of your fellow colleagues are in spaces that aren't dropping by that much. So you don't even have the misery less company kind of dynamic. And what is the playbook for Amphenol in times like that. It's not to run and hide, it's not to just cower and sort of drown in sorrows. You take quick action. You make sure that your resources that you have deployed are befitting the demand that you have from your customers. And then you go out and you build new basis of business and you take the opportunity of the crisis. And that's really important that you take the opportunity from that crisis to diversify your business even further, to support the customers who still need you in those difficult times. Because then when it comes back, you have a much broader, more stable, more robust and high potential business to run. And that's what our team, who works in commercial air has done. And so yes, we're not quite back to the kind of pre-pandemic levels, but the world is also not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. I mean certainly, there's more travel and airports are more crowded here. But Craig and I went to Asia recently and I can tell you, there's a lot less flights crossing the Pacific than they ever were before. So the sort of widebody, long-haul kind of part of the business travel that was a real big driver of aircraft demand, that is still yet to be fully recovered. But our team has just done a fabulous job of being there for our customers, making sure that we have the right resources and using the opportunity of the crisis such that when things do normalize and they're on the path to doing that, we'll be in a better position today than we were prior to the crisis. What we also see in aerospace and one of the areas where I'll tell you our team spends quite a bit of time because they had a little bit of extra time given the downturn with the major traditional jetliner manufacturers, is this whole world of kind of new aviation, electrified aviation, different kinds of small startups all over the place doing really innovative and exciting things. And our team is working on just dozens and dozens of programs with countless of these companies, large and small, who are trying to really change the face of aviation in a world where everybody wants to reduce the amount of carbon that's being put in the atmosphere. And we have so much going on around Amphenol that's in support of this decarbonization. And I'll tell you that our team in Comair has really stepped up there and has just a really pervasive presence designing new products that really suit the unique applications of some of these next-generation systems that may eventually make it such that we can get on a plane, and we won't be just belching carbon in the atmosphere as we're moving across the country. And I personally am really hopeful for that for me and for our next generation. And I'm really proud of what the company is doing in that respect. Operator : Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, operator, thank you so much. And in particular, thank you to everybody who is on the call here today. Thanks for your great questions. And I wish that everybody enjoys a wonderful fall, and we will be back together with you here in 90 days. And by then, amazingly, it will be 2023. So have a wonderful rest of the year, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

Following the presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone Happy New Year and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Our fourth quarter 2022 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, all prior year comparative data discussed during this year is on a continuing operations basis. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3.239 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82 and $0.78, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 7% in U.S. dollars 11% local currencies and 8% organically, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sequentially, sales were down by 2% in U.S. dollars, 1% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full-year 2022, sales were a record $12.623 billion, which were up 16% U.S. dollars 19% in local currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2021. Orders in the quarter were $2.884 billion, which was down 12%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and 8% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.89:1. This was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets. For the full-year, orders were $12.925 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.02:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $666 million and $676 million, respectively, in fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP and adjusted operating margin were 20.6% and 20.9% respectively in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 100 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points, sequentially. GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter included approximately $10 million of acquisition related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 80 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter of \u201921 and decreased by 10 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of ongoing pricing actions. On a sequential basis, the slight decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. For the year 2022, GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and adjusted operating margin was 20.7%, when compared to 2021, adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, which was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of pricing actions. Given the overall cost and supply chain headwinds we experienced in 2022, we are very proud that our adjusted operating margin equals our previous full-year record operating margin set in 2018. Breaking down fourth quarter and full- year results by segment, in the harsh environment solutions segment, sales were $795 million and $3.107 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically. Segment operating margin was 25.7% and 25.8% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022 respectively. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.436 billion and $5.652 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter segment sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and organically, compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.2% and 22% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $1.008 billion and $3.863 billion in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. Compared to the prior year fourth quarter, segment sales increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. Compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically. Segment operating margin was 19.2% and 18.5% in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2022. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 19.2% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compares to 18.8% and 23.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021 respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP effective tax rate was 22.3% and adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5%, which compared to 20.6% and 24.3% in 2021. In 2023, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.82 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14%, compared to $0.72 in the prior period. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.78, an increase of 11%, compared to the $0.70 in the fourth quarter of \u201921. This was an excellent result. For the full-year, GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations was $3.06, a 22$ increase from $2.51 in 2021. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3 in 2022, a 21% increase from $2.48 in 2021. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $705 million or 147% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $613 million or $127% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have delivered a cash flow yield at these strong levels. For the full-year 2022, operating cash was a record $2.175 billion or 117% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow for 2022 was a record $1.796 billion or 96% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 86, 73 and 54 days respectively. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.3 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $75, bringing total repurchases during 2022 to 9.9 shares or $731 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in 2022 was more than $1.2 billion. Total debt at December 31 was $4.6 billion and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very strong $4.1 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.4 billion plus availability under existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full-year 2022 EBITDA was $798 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, our net leverage ratio was 1 times. I also wanted to make a few comments on interest expense. As I mentioned last quarter, due to the rising interest rate environment, our interest expense had increased primarily as a result of our floating rate convertible paper, which represents approximately 14% of our total debt outstanding at the end of the year. Based on current and near-term expected interest rates and debt levels, we expect 2023 quarterly interest expense to be approximately $40 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance. I\u2019d now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends, as well as the recently completed acquisition this month. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig. And welcome to all of you to our first earnings call of 2023 and I hope it's not too late to wish as well all of you a Happy New Year and to those of you celebrate the Lunar New Year, wish you all a happy year of the rabbit. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 achievements, including some discussion about the acquisitions that we mentioned in our press release. I\u2019ll then discuss our trends and progress in our served markets and then make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and of course, we'll have time for questions at the end. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results in the fourth quarter were stronger-than-expected. Exceeding the high-end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 7% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currencies, reaching $3.239 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 8% and that was driven by robust growth in the broadband, commercial air, automotive and military end markets. And I'll give some more details about those markets in a few moments. The company booked $2.884 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.89:1, and this negative book-to-bill was driven by order reductions in several of the communications related markets as certain customers adjusted demand in light of excess inventory that they had built up throughout 2022. We're especially pleased to have delivered another quarter of resilient and strong profitability with adjusted operating margins reaching 20.9% and 80 basis point increase from prior year. We achieved these results despite the continued wide range of challenges around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS, as Craig mentioned were $0.78, representing robust growth of 11% from prior year and that's another excellent reflection of our organization's continued strong execution. Finally, the company generated record operating free cash flow in the quarter of $705 million and $613 million, respectively, clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I'm extremely proud of our team around the world and our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased to announce that we closed the acquisition of Control Measure Regulation Group or CMR just here in January. CMR is based in France and has annual sales of approximately $75 million and they're a manufacturer of a broad array of cable assemblies and complex interconnect assemblies for the industrial market with a particular focus on heavy equipment engine applications. This acquisition further expands our offering of high technology, value-added interconnect products in the diversified industrial market. In addition, we're pleased to have signed an agreement for the acquisition of the North American hybrid and fiber optic cable and cable assembly, as well as the global infrastructure antenna business of RFS at the end of the fourth quarter. Based just down the street from us here in Meriden, Connecticut, RFS is a provider of Interconnect and Antenna products for the mobile networks market with expected sales of approximately $100 million in 2023. This acquisition, which we anticipate will close by the end of the second quarter and thus is not included in our guidance, expands Amphenol\u2019s product offering and presence with mobile network service providers, who are continuing to invest in their next generation 5G networks. As we welcome the outstanding CMR team to Amphenol and look ahead to welcome the RFS team once that transaction closes, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. I just want to make a few comments about 2022. And I would just say that 2022 was another very successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically reaching a new sales record of $12.623 billion. In fact, over the past three very dynamic years, we're proud to have grown our sales by more than 50% from our 2019 levels, actually 53% to be exact, a great reflection of the company's diversification and agility in these truly dynamic times. Our full-year 2022 adjusted operating margins reached 20.7% and that was an increase of 70 basis points from 2021. This strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $3. Finally, we generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.175 billion and $1.796 billion respectively, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program again created value this year with two new companies added to the Amphenol family in 2022 and one added here already in 2023. CMR, NPI and ICA Holdings have expanded our position across a broad array of technologies, particularly in the industrial market, while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol family. We're excited that these acquisitions, as well as the RFS acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the second quarter, represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance. We also bought back in 2022 almost 10 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, representing as Craig detailed a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1.2 billion for the year. Finally and really importantly, especially in this today's dynamic environment, we come out of 2022 in a uniquely robust financial position with the lowest leverage and highest liquidity and availability we've seen really in modern times. And while there continued to be a high level of volatility in the overall market environment in 2022, as we enter 2023, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. I'd like to spend a little bit of time to talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create real value for the company with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in the year of 2022. We believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets, while continuing to expose us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. Turning first to the military market, this market represented 10% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 9% of our sales for the full-year. Sales in the quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies and on an organic basis sales increased by 12% with broad-based growth across virtually all applications, but particularly military vehicles, space and airframes. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 11%. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currencies and 4% organically, reflecting our operational execution, as well as strength in space related unmanned aerial vehicles, ground vehicles and avionics applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to grow slightly from these fourth quarter levels and we continue to be excited by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we offer the industry's broadest array of high technology Interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become more dynamic, militaries around the world are expanding their investments in next generation technologies, thereby increasing the demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our expanded range of Interconnect and Sensor products, as well as our significant investments in new capacity that we have made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter, as well as for the full-year 2022. And in the quarter, our sales grew by very strong 33% in U.S. dollars and 38% in local currency and organic. As we benefited from the continued recovery in the commercial air market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 13% from the third quarter, which was well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, sales increased by 36% in U. S dollars, 40% in local currency and 36% organically, reflecting our strong design in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as the ongoing recovery in demand for aircraft. Looking into the first quarter of \u201923, we expect now a modest sequential moderation in sales. I just want to say how grateful I am to our team that's working in the commercial air market. Over the last three years, they performed really well amidst a truly volatile demand environment. And with the ongoing recovery in travel and thus in demand for jetliners, our team's efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology Interconnect and Sensor products, while diversifying our market position, including into next generation aircraft are now paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this in 2023 and beyond. Industrial market represented 25percent of our sales both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and sales in the quarter grew by 7% in U.S. dollars, 12% in local currency and 7% organically from the prior year fourth quarter. This growth was driven in particular by sales into alternative energy, battery and electric heavy vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas and medical applications. On a sequential basis, sales were down by just 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations. For the full-year 2022, sales grew by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 13% organically, and we really had broad-based growth across virtually all segments of the global industrial market. And looking into the first quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the fourth quarter. Our outstanding global team working in the industrial market continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many segments of this exciting market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology Interconnect, Antenna and Sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions happening across the industrial electronics market. To that end, the addition of CMR further strengthens our position, particularly in the important heavy equipment segment. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and we had another great quarter in automotive sales growing by a strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 31% in local currency and organic. Our growth was broad-based, but was once again particularly robust in hybrid and electric vehicle applications. On a sequential basis, our automotive sales increased by 5%, which was above our prior expectations. For the full-year 2022, I'm very pleased that our sales increased by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency and organic, reflecting broad strength across our automotive markets, including in particular in next generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2023, we expect a high single-digit sequential moderation of sales in the first quarter from these high levels, driven especially by a seasonal moderation of sales in Asia. I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market. They continue to manage through a dynamic overall environment all while remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers, who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts that expanding our range of next generation Interconnects incorporated into electric and hybrid electric vehicles has enabled Amphenol to expand our position with a broad range of customers and thereby created further potential for the future. The mobile devices market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Our sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by reduced sales of products incorporated into smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined as we had expected by 10% as demand was impacted by a pull forward of demand into the third quarter as we it discussed 90-days ago. For the full-year 2022, sales in this market increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically, as growth in smartphones and wearables was somewhat offset by a moderation in tablets coming off the higher levels of the pandemic. We are pleased with this performance amidst the market with generally muted demand in 2022. As we look into the first quarter of \u201923, we anticipate a seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. And while mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of Antennas, Interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 5% for the full-year 2022. Sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currency and 12% organically as we experienced the pause in demand from operators after a number of quarters of strong growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by a higher-than-expected 17%. For the full-year \u201922, sales grew by 8% from prior year and 3% organically as we saw increased demand for products used in next generation 5G equipment. Looking ahead, we expect a high single-digit sequential reduction in sales in the first quarter as operators continue to moderate their investments. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of their efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. And as customers continue their investments in these systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're also excited by the pending acquisition of the hybrid and fiber optic cable and antenna assets of RFS, which will further broaden our product offerings for this important market. The information technology and data communications market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and 21% of sales for the full-year. Sales in the fourth quarter declined by 6% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currency and 8% organically from prior year as many customers reduced their demand after five consecutive quarters of robust double-digit growth. Sequentially, our sales declined by 11% as we had expected coming into the quarter. For the full-year 2022, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a strong 18% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 14% organically as we continue to benefit from our leading technology solutions and design and positions across a wide array of applications. Looking ahead, we expect a roughly 20% sequential decline in sales in the first quarter as our OEM and web service customers continue to moderate their demand levels. Regardless of this current demand pause, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team has done an excellent job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic Interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. We look forward to realizing the benefits of that leading position in this important market for many years to come. Finally, the broadband market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and 5% of our sales for the full-year 2022. Sales increased by a very strong 79% in U.S. dollars, 82% in local currencies and 64% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. On a sequential basis, sales grew by a much better-than-expected 19%. For the full-year 2022 sales grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, as we benefited from strong demand from broadband service operators, who are both upgrading and expanding their data networks, as well as from the Halo acquisition completed last year. Looking ahead, we expect sales to decline in the low double-digits from these levels, due to seasonal adjustments from customers. We remain encouraged by the company's expanding position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And in certain cases in furtherance of government programs to expand broadband. Now just in summary, I want to comment on our outlook. The current economic environment remains highly uncertain. In addition, as we did discuss earlier, we have seen certain customers in the communications markets reduce their demand as they normalize inventory levels. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.840 billion to $2.900 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. This would represent a sales decline of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS of flat to down 3%, compared to the first quarter of \u201922. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and robust profitability over the long-term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and for the full-year of 2022. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Guy Hardwick : Hi, good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon. Guy Hardwick : I think I'll leave the questions on guidance to callers after me. But Adam, just when I speak to investors about Amphenol, they push back initially, if they don't know the company that well, that's why isn't this company exposed to commodity price deflation if it's selling components to the electronics industry. What was your -- what would be your pushback on that? And maybe if you could talk about some of the content drivers in connectors and other products? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Guy. And I think what you're referring to is, kind of, Moore's Law, which says that over time, whether it's every 18-months or some approximation thereof, that electronics tend to get a doubling of the performance for the given price. And I think that, that is true in electronics that if you look at what we -- the devices that we use today, the networks that we use today, we get so much more out of those things given the increase or even in certain cases, not increase of what we pay for those things today. And so it comes down then to innovation. And are we, as a company, innovating, developing products that are enabling our customers' applications and allowing our customers to sell value. And so you mentioned commodity. And we don't view our products as a commodity. Actually, we view them as a very precious piece of jewelry almost that the Interconnect products that we make from connectors to value-add Interconnect, Sensors, Antennas, these are highly critical components that go into very complex systems, everything from mobile devices all the way up to fighter jets and everything in between. And they represent also a very high risk and relatively low value as a percentage of the total bill of materials. And thus, if you can embed technology, if you can embed value, if you can be there for your customers, well, then your customers will be willing to share with you some of the value that they're able to realize on the sale of the end product. And so the difference between, kind of, a standard commodity is something that you see the price trading on an exchange somewhere, and ours is just a chasm of distance between them, because our products are enabling technology. They're very much application specific. We're selling hundreds of thousands and millions of different products to tens of thousands of customers and millions of different applications around the world. And if our product doesn't work, that small little thing in the system, then ultimately, the system itself doesn't perform for its customers. And so it's up to us to develop innovative new technologies on a consistent basis to be able to execute on behalf of our customers to do that with high quality, high reliability with a breadth of products so customers can come to us all at once. And if we can do that consistently, then we're able to realize good margins while also controlling the cost on our side. And that's another piece of this, which is that at the end of the day, margin is price minus cost. And so we have to control the price by selling value to our customers. We have to control the cost by ensuring that every element of cost is controlled and treated as it was coming out of our own pockets. And that comes really from the entrepreneurial organization, the 130 general managers around the world, who all treat the company's money as if it were their own. And the fact that we don't have cost centers in the company, we have a tiny little headquarters. And so that control on cost together with selling value through technology ultimately allows us to realize robust margins on a consistent basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I feel, I guess, Adam, I'm hoping you can just maybe talk a little bit more about the March quarter guide. You folks are talking about revenue being down double-digits sequentially. And I don't want you to repeat all these segments discussion, but you sort of talking about 2 times normal seasonality. Perhaps you just talk about what are the one or two segments you think that are performing worse than what you would expect them to do in the normal seasonal environment? And then to the extent this weakness that you see in March, do you think it's more demand weakness? Or is it more inventory adjustment by our customers? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Amit. There's a little bit of static on the line, but I think I heard the question well. Look, our guidance that we've given here, and I think I talked a lot about by each segment, but let me just put a finer point on this. If you just take two of our end markets and the guidance that I discussed and that's mobile devices and IT datacom, which are two of our largest communications markets, those represent about two-thirds collectively of the implied sequential reduction in sales from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And I think we talked about in IT datacom that we clearly see a, sort of, reduction in orders from customers, because of elevated inventory levels. And there may be some demand layered into that, as well as our customer -- as the end customers, kind of, pause their build-outs, but we shouldn't forget one thing about IT datacom. We shouldn't forget that this is a market, first of all, that since 2019, we've grown that market by more than 70% during that time period that our customers have had to increase their output and their construction of their networks in order to satisfy a true explosion of demand for the Internet. And I think the underlying drivers of that, whether that be a video over the Internet or the use of certain tools that we didn't ever use before, the data traffic on the Internet is not dropping. I think what we are seeing is maybe a pause and a kind of realignment because these companies went real gangbusters for a number of years. But the structural increase of data traffic over the Internet in the broadest sense, that's something that we believe, and I think we're in good company believing that we'll continue for a long time to come. On mobile devices, I think we talked about the fact that during the course of the pandemic, there was a real surge in mobile device demand, as people had to detach from their offices and go home, things like tablets, things like computers, upgrades of phones and the like. Let alone the fact that everybody had a lot of disposable income to buy new things in their ears and on their wrists and otherwise. And I think there's been some relaxation of demand that's well reported, and you yourself have talked a lot about that in a variety of reports here in 2022. And regardless of that, our team did a fabulous job this year, driving 5% organic growth in 2022. But we're reacting to the demand that we hear from our customers. We're not losing share. Quite the contrary. But the demand expectations of our customers here in the first quarter really result in the guidance that we've given. So I would maybe point to those two markets, most particularly, which represent just roughly two-thirds of the sequential decline in our outlook. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon and Happy New Year, everyone. Adam, it's just a question regarding the industrial markets. In addition to your acquisitions, you've been growing really well organically. And there was some concern that those industrial markets typically lag some of the other markets like consumer and datacom. There's also concerns about inventory build, but it sounds like you're relatively optimistic in terms of the drivers across those diversified markets. So any color you can give on your outlook there would be great? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks so much, Matt, and Happy New Year back to you. No, look, our industrial market has a real bright spot for us over these three years. And I just mentioned how IT datacom since 2019 has grown by 70%. Our industrial business has actually grown by more than 90% during that time period. And we've added some amazing acquisitions across Interconnect and Sensors, but we've also driven really strong organic growth. And I think, last year, we grew by 13% organically. In \u201821, we grew by 27% organically and really on a wide swatch of the industrial market, which is very, very diversified inside it. This industrial lag consumer and datacom, I don't have a really good opinion about that, I think they're quite different markets. You have a lot of very different demand drivers. And if you think about what are the underlying drivers of demand in industrial, well, think about the things that are in the headlines today. Things like investments in infrastructure, things like electrification, things like decarbonization, which includes everything from infrastructure to support electrification, which includes things like alternative energy generation, which includes things like natural gas conversion and pipelines. And we've actually seen funny enough, like strong performance in both our alternative energy business, but also our oil and gas business. Both of those are really showing really strong momentum right now. And I wouldn't think that any of those correlate necessarily to a consumer or a datacom world. Is there inventory in the supply chain of industrial? I don't have good evidence to say, yes or no to that. I'm sure if you looked at a variety of publicly traded balance sheets, you may see some evidence of and some evidence of not. We do look in our distribution channel in there. I think inventories are healthy. They're not crazy. I mean, they may be up a touch or two, but not out of whack to the overall demand environment. Look, industrial is going through a true revolution. And when you think about everything from electrification, electronification, all the underlying drivers that I talked about, I think we've done a fabulous job, and our team in that area has done a fabulous job, both organically, as well as identifying and bringing to the Amphenol family great companies like CMR this quarter and many others over the last three, four years that put the company in a strong position going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, Adam. Hi, Craig. Thanks for taking the question and Happy New Year. I guess the question I had was more on the margins. You had pretty robust margins in the fourth quarter. But as you're sort of looking in terms of the end market outlook and some of this sub-seasonal sort of trajectory starting off the year. How should we think about the puts and takes on the margin and also in relation to some of the acquisitions that you've done recently? What sort of impact on the margin will that have? How resilient are these sort of margin levels at this point? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Great. Thanks, Samik, and Happy New Year to you. Yes, I think that if you think about our margin, I mean, I think I'd start off by just saying how proud we are of the margins performance that we've had in 2022. We really have, ultimately -- I mean, throughout 2022, we really done, I think, a great job of just expanding our margins, even sequentially converting, kind of, higher than our normal conversion with the cost actions, with the pricing actions we've had to take. And thus -- and really hitting our 21% in Q3, which is kind of a timing of record and really 20.9% in Q4 and then 20.7%, which matches the record of 2018. So I'm really happy with certainly achieving those. And as we guide here into the first quarter, we're guiding down, I'd say, above seasonal and then we talked about -- Adam just talked about that in response to a previous question. And I think if you, kind of, look at the markets, we've always said that our markets don't really drive kind of our margins. So we don't have significant margin differences of a significant range within our markets, except for broadband, we've talked about before, which was our old cable business. But other than that, I think the markets are similar operating margins and drive similar conversion level. So I wouldn't really talk about that as being a place where it's driving a change in the way our overall conversions would look. We talked about decrementals and kind of that close to 30% range. We're kind of seeing a little -- even slightly less than that as we're guiding here into the first quarter. And I think that just goes to the management team and how well they have done in regards to responding to some of these areas where we have seen some headwinds from a demand perspective in IT data, which is declining at above normal rate typically. And then in the first quarter, they're taking great actions that obviously are reflected in our guide and not necessarily impacting our normal conversion. And mobile devices, they're used to these types of decrementals and headwinds in terms of their first quarter and certainly, they're taking them. So I think that -- and this is really not a different story than we've had over many years where we're able to manage, you know, regardless of the demand environment, we're able to manage their operating margins and really do a great job of expanding our margins when we see demand increases, which we've done here in 2022. And then here in Q1, where we see a little bit of headwind in certain of our markets, taking the actions that really need to be taken in regards to protecting our bottom line. And I think that agility of the organization is really going to -- shining through again. And I think that's just no different from what we've seen historically. And I wouldn't expect any difference in terms of whatever comes here in 2023. And regardless, I think I feel really comfortable with how the team will perform. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. Could you speak please to what Amphenol has seen in the China market, both how it's been tracking recently, given the COVID dynamics and also whether you're expecting demand in China to pick up materially over the course of this year given reopening? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Mark. And look, I'm glad you bring off China, because I want to just give a real shout out to our team in China. Q4 in China was a funky quarter. You came in with zero COVID and you left with 100% COVID. And that created a lot of challenges operationally. And the fact that we were able not only to deliver on our commitments in the quarter, but to actually exceed our guidance in the quarter was just a real testament to our entire global organization, but in particular, to our team in China, who just manage through this well while protecting our people as best you can in a country where basically everybody got COVID, it was really phenomenal And I'm just so proud of what they were able to do during that time period. Look, our business in China, we have a great business in China. Our China business is very much a business for the local region, for the customers, who want to buy in those regions. And we've done such a great job over the years despite geopolitics and all of that of being a truly local company, and this gets to kind of our organization, which I think, I've used the term before that we have an organization that's really purpose-built for whatever the world order is going to be. And that's an organization of people who are made up of local nationals all over the world, people from India in India, people from China in China, people from France in France. And that allows us to really tailor our operations to the requirements of that region and of that country. And we've certainly done that in China over these last several very dynamic years. In terms of whether we expect a kind of a demand rebound in China, I don't know, I think it's a little early to say that. But whatever comes will come. And I think we're poised and positioned that if there is some rebound, if there is an increase in consumer spending or whatever on whatever kind of products, there's no doubt in my mind that our team will be there to capture more than our fair share if that should so occur. I mean, they demonstrated here in the fourth quarter that nothing can stop them. And I'm very confident that whatever comes along, we'll take full advantage. And if risks materialize, if some impediments should come along, I mean, this is a team that's pretty battle hardened. So I'm pretty confident they'll do a great job. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon and Happy New Year. I was just wondering, Adam, if you could talk a little bit more about the business, you're acquiring from RFS. It seems like it's a bit of a game changer for you guys in terms of product and how you might be able to compete against some larger players in antennas, et cetera? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steven. Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we're really excited about this business. I mean, we have a business in fiber optics, we have a business in hybrid cable, we have a business in antennas. But no doubt about it, RFS brings us a much, much stronger position from a technology perspective, from a capacity perspective and from a channel into certain markets. And we've always been really excited about the mobile networks market. And one of the unique things about Amphenol is, I think I've said this many times, is that we sell to the OEMs. We're one of the leading interconnect suppliers to the world's leading OEMs who make mobile networks equipment, but we also sell to the service providers and to the operators. And that actually is an evolution of our long-term position with the broadband service providers where we know how to work with service providers. And today, we work with service providers in broadband, we work with them in the IT datacom market, we work with them in broadband -- I mean, in mobile networks. And anywhere where now providers are our customers and not just OEMs making equipment. And I think RFS really allows us to take a step function growth in the strength of our position there with service providers. And doing that at a time where we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G investments in the network, let alone what happens when 5G exists for all of our other markets. And we're big believers on the kind of structural potential of both the build-out of the 5G networks that are happening around the world, as well as what it means to have low latency, ultra-high bandwidth ubiquitous data traffic for all of our end markets. And after 5G will come, 6G and then there will come 7G, and you and I will probably still be floating around when we're talking about 10G one day, Steve. But now, we're really excited about RFS and look forward to them. I look forward to getting to the regulatory process. And again, we expect to close it at the end of the second quarter. And thus, it's not in our guide here in the first quarter, but it is certainly in our long-term strategy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may go ahead. Jim Suva : Hi, Adam, you and your team have been through many similar cycles. And I wanted to focus a little bit on the communications commentary you gave about a little bit of inventory digestion or some pauses or things like that? Just curious, in past cycles, have you seen these last kind of one to two quarters or multiple, multiple quarters from when you sit there, it seems like this is one segment that is taking a little bit of a downshift, not that structurally you're losing share problems with it, but more of a cyclical nature if I understand your comments correctly? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Jim. I would love to be able to extrapolate from sort of past experience to today. But I would tell you that I don't know that at least in my history, which is, by the way, 25-years this year in the company, to live through a time period like we've just gone through in the last three years and what that has done to the dynamics of the market from a pandemic to a supply chain crisis, to an explosion of data traffic that came out of the pandemic and shutdowns and work-from-home and all those various things, the transformation of how people consume, entertainment and media and information. So I don't know that there is a good template for kind of the -- what has happened in the IT datacom market over the last three years. And thus, it would be hard for me to say, do I expect this to be a one quarter, two quarter or whatever kind of an adjustment? And thus, we don't run our business that way. The fact is it is what it is right now, and we adjust in real time our resources to accommodate the level of demand that we see from each of our operations. We have 131 operations around the world right now, roughly. And each of them have their own set of customers. Some of whom have demand that is growing and others of whom and that includes those who work in this market, where maybe demand is moderating somewhat. They don't make a guess and say, well, is that going to be a one, two, three quarter thing, and thus, what should I do? They just say, my customer needs this much, and I'm going to go out and adjust my resources in real time. And that real-time reactivity and agility that Craig mentioned earlier, which, by the way, was reflected in our margins in the fourth quarter and is also reflected in our margins in the first quarter, that's how we run the business. We'll react to whatever the demand environment is, and we're not going to try to trip over ourselves trying to guess how long it is. But what I know is this, long-term, the demand for data, the demand for our products, leading edge, high-speed fiber optic power products, that's going to be a very robust demand long-term. And so we will come through this adjustment that our customers are going through, and we will come out of it a stronger company than ever, and we will continue to have a very robust technology position in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and Happy New Year from me as well. Adam, your auto business is underlying production now by an extremely strong level each of the past two years. And I know it's always hard to parse up, but do you get the sense that channel inventory of your products has influenced that outgrowth at all? And maybe just more importantly, as you look forward, what do you see as the key factors plus or minus versus history that could influence your ability to grow strongly above market again in 2023? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks to you and Happy New Year as well. Look, you said it, I mean, we have definitely outperformed in the automotive market for a pretty long time period here, quite a number of quarters, and I'm just really proud of our team. There weren't always easy years, I mean, clearly, 2020 was a tough year. Even 2019 was a challenging year. But we never kind of threw in the towel during that time period. We never said let's go cut back on new product investment or let's retrench, let's reorganize, quite the contrary. In fact, we continue to work with customers around the world on next-generation applications. And those next-generation applications, everything from passenger connectivity and power applications to high-voltage applications in the car to communications around Antennas and the like. we are now really realizing the benefits of that over the last couple of years. And in terms of the channel, we don't really see the channel and the inventory in the channel as being a big driver of the demand. I think the driver of the demand has been the rapid adoption of new electronic systems, in particular, electrification of cars, but not exclusively electrification. And so when I think about the key factors that can be plus or minus in the future, well, sure, at some level, the number of cars being sold matters. But more importantly is the content of electronics and the content of new systems in those cars in the future. And if that content continues to move up and to the right and if we continue to do a pretty decent job of getting some or more than our fair share of that, then I think there's good potential for our automotive business in the long-term. I would not get out in front of my skis here and tell you that 29% organic growth is going to be our perpetuity or 41% that we achieved in 2021. But we're very confident in our -- in the strength of our position. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. Will Stein : Great, thanks. I'd love to hear about how the backlog changed during the quarter, and in particular, the duration of the backlog and perhaps it relates to lead times somewhat, whether you're seeing customers still place orders in excess of lead times to the degree that has been a pattern? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Will. I mean, look, we obviously had in the fourth quarter a lower book-to-bill of 0.89. But I would just point out that over the course of this year, we still have a positive book-to-bill of 1.02. And if you look over the last two years, we've actually booked in the last two years, $25 billion in orders and we've shipped $23.5 billion in sales. So we've added $1.5 billion to our backlog during that time. And we have, today, still a very robust backlog. I think we talked about last quarter that we probably saw about a three-week expansion of our backlog. And I think we're probably still roughly in that ballpark right now, somewhere around a three-week or so beyond what maybe it was in the past. And when I say the past like 2020 and maybe year-end. And that's a really strong position. At the same time, there's no doubt about it that the kind of acute phase of the supply chain crisis and the kind of multiplicity of pressures that was put on our customers across really all of our markets, I think we're beyond the acute phase of that supply chain crisis. I'm not going to tell you like it's totally in the rearview mirror, like there's still little things that people have to deal with. But I would not be surprised if our customers, kind of, normalize a little bit more their lead times across the board. And one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the supply chain crisis that came thereafter, is we were doing a great job. I mean, we supported our customers through the time. We did not meaningfully have to extend our lead times, but customers were sort of taking a one-size-fits-all approach in several of the markets. And that led, I think, them to certainly in the communications market, to maybe end up ordering a little bit more than they were going to do. I would also point out one other thing out here just in the fourth quarter, with our relatively low book-to-bill, compared to historical levels, actually, that was really concentrated in our communications markets. And we saw a book-to-bill outside of the communications market, which was basically 1 :1 in the fourth quarter, which also gives us some confidence that there's still a robust demand for our products. But I don't think in terms of the normalization, I would expect some normalization. That whole cliche of just in time versus just in case, maybe customers long term will have a little bit more order windows. But I think we sit in a really good position here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. So the company has taken a lot of share coming out of the pandemic. And there has been a heightened focus on resiliency and connectivity from the customer base, again, coming out of the pandemic. I'd just be interested to hear how you think about those two drivers as the macro seemingly will normalize here at some point? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Chris. I mean, look, resiliency connectivity, I think there's been a lot of things that have shifted. We've just been through a once in a several-generation pandemic. Hopefully, we are sort of at the tail end of it. I know our team in China certainly hopes that in the fourth quarter. But I think it has changed everything. It's touched everything. Let me say that, whether it's dramatically changed everything. But no doubt, resiliency and ability of a company to be there for its customers regardless of what comes along. That is definitely more in the consideration of our customers than ever before, and that plays very well into our approach. Our approach has never been to put all our eggs in one basket to build these massive campuses. We have 250 facilities around the world. Some people think we're crazy to have that many factories, but part of it is risk. Part of it is making sure that we're close to our customers, and we're not putting all of our eggs in one basket. And we have a pretty fragmented manufacturing footprint all over the world with low-cost operations in all three of the major regions in continents. And I'll tell you that, that enabled us during this time period to take share from maybe some of our competitors, who are either smaller or more concentrated and thus, we're stricken by these kind of unpredictable impediments that came along during the pandemic and the supply chain crisis. And relative to connectivity, and I'm going to sort of put a little stab on what your implication is there, I mean, communications, the Internet, the ability to stay in touch with people, that has clearly been a dramatic shift in this pandemic. And we look at our position in our communications markets and the phenomenal growth that we've had, and I mentioned the IT datacom market for us growing 70% during that time period. But also, mobile devices grew by nearly 25% over those same three years. And that's just a reflection of this kind of now demand for people to have a multitude of ways of communicating and connecting with each other. And that's something as we seek to sort of enable the electronics revolution, that's the phrase I always use, there's no doubt about it that we're living in revolutionary times. And that creates a real structural and long-term opportunity for Amphenol. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Hey, Adam, notwithstanding the comments you made on IT datacom earlier that might also apply to mobile devices. You specifically called out mobile device kind of mean reverting from abnormal COVID-driven level. So does that imply we should expect some seasonal growth for 2023? And more broadly, is visibility, maybe ex mobile devices, beginning to improve at all in your markets? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. I am not going to get out in front of my skis on trying to give an estimate of what mobile device demand is going to look like this year. You know, well, I'm bad at guiding it even for the 70 or so days that we try to give guidance in a quarter let alone to make some estimate of what it's going to look like in the course of the year. It's hard for me to do that. What I do know is there's a lot of new devices, they're wonderful. I'm addicted to mine, and we have a strong position. And so I don't take a position otherwise on whether mobile devices is going to have a worse or better performance seasonally going through the rest of this year. I mean, we tried to give some guidance here in the first quarter. We'll see what happens there, and then we'll try to give some guidance on the second quarter 90 days from now. Relative to visibility in general, look, it's still a fairly uncertain world. And so I don't know that there's a dramatic improvement in visibility. I mean, we're not giving full-year guidance. We don't think it's prudent at this time, because there is still a lot of dynamism, a lot of uncertainty in the world today. And so we'll see. I mean, I certainly hope that as we passed the three-year mark on the anniversary, I think -- it's actually three years from day after tomorrow that Wuhan was shut down. I remembered it very, very well. And you hope that after three years, it renormalizes. There's a saying in Chinese that a pandemic doesn't last more than three years. It's a famous old saying that, I think, a very old saying in Chinese. And hopefully, that is really the case, and there can be a little bit more normalization. But I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Kelley with Jefferies. You may go ahead. David Kelley : Hey, good afternoon, Adam and Craig. Maybe a question on the input cost environment. We've seen certain commodities pull back in certain areas. Energy and labor costs remain elevated and then maybe pricing pass-throughs might get tougher in 2023. But if we take a step back, can you just talk about the Amphenol cost opportunities in 2023? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thank you, David. I think that, certainly, the cost environment is, in some ways, a little bit different than it probably was as we, kind of, entered the year here. I think there are certain places where it has improved, there\u2019s other places, honestly, where it probably hasn't improved. But I mean, certainly, on certain commodities, we've seen some level of relief in certain parts of the business without a doubt. But places like energy, places like the labor, certainly, logistics has gotten a little better, but I would say energy and labor is certainly very -- sill continues to be a headwind in many places. So I'd say, on balance, it probably has made some improvements from a commodity perspective. I think that what does that mean from a cost perspective in 2023? It's tough to tell our margin perspective. I mean, there's no doubt that in a normal environment, you would expect some pricing headwinds from your customers. And whether or not they will start in certain places to try to come back to pricing, we'll certainly do our best to -- as we always do to -- as we add value to our customers to ensure that we're keeping that fair margin. But as costs come down, I would expect in some places for pricing to have some headwind. But I would expect that ultimately a balance to happen where we were able to protect our margins and continue to have strong margins. It really wouldn't -- I wouldn't think change from a profitability perspective. And in a normal environment, prior to the pandemic when inflation was kind of at a normal pace and the demand environment was normal, that's -- you did have that kind of normal balance. And I expect that, ultimately, over time, we'll see that again. And whether or not that happens in \u201823, that's a little bit too early to predict. But I think we are in a better place, both on the price and a cost perspective, than we certainly were a year ago. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Michael Anastasio with Cowen. You may go ahead. Michael Anastasio : Happy New Year. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just quantify the impact of price in 2022 overall? And if there's any areas that were strong in particular? And what are your expectations for the upcoming year? A - Craig Lampo Yes. I was kind of I was saying before, I mean, certainly, we did have some pricing kind of momentum in 2022. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you what exactly the impact the price was on our top line. We don't -- unfortunately, our systems aren't capable of even providing that information. I would say it's somewhere kind of in maybe low single digits, but it's a very difficult thing to even have to provide. So -- and honestly, it really wouldn't provide us with any help in regards to how we run our business. So it's not something we're necessarily focused on. But certainly, there was some pricing in 2022. We've talked about that and without a doubt there was. I mean, again, as I mentioned before, in a normal environment, pricing would be, I would say, more of a headwind than a tailwind and \u201822 was a slight tailwind, I would say. And I know it's tough to say whether we'll be in 2023 as the cost environment maybe levels off a bit. But ultimately, whatever it is, I know I'm really not so concerned. I think that the team has continued to do a great job of managing cost, managing price and ultimately ensuring at the end of the day, we're getting paid for the value we provide to our customers. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much. And again, we'd like -- Craig and I would like to, on behalf of our entire team around the world, express our gratitude to each of you for the confidence you put in us. And we wish you all the best and look forward to speaking with you just a short 90-days from now. Thank you, everybody. Happy New Year again, and stay safe. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn \u2013 introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 conference call. Our first quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $2.974 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.71 and $0.69, respectively. First quarter sales were up 1% in U.S. dollars and organically and up 3% in local currencies compared to the first quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were down by 8% in U.S. dollars, 9% in local currencies and 10% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $2.896 billion, which was down 16% compared to the first quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.97 to 1. The lower book-to-bill was driven by lower bookings in the communications related markets, which continue to experience a decline in demand. GAAP and adjusted operating income were $592 million and $597 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2023. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 19.9% and 20.1%, respectively, in the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 70 basis points sequentially, and GAAP operating margins for the first quarter included $5 billion of acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and decreased by 80 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was driven by strong operating leverage on the modestly higher sales volumes. And on a sequential basis, the decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected normal downside conversion on the lower sales levels. Our team continues to execute strongly in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these strong levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world, including the moderating conditions in several of our communications-related markets. In particular, we truly appreciate the quick reactivity of our teams working in the communications markets, who took appropriate actions to preserve strong profitability in the face of downturns in customer demand. Breaking down first quarter results by segment. In the Harsh Environment Solutions segment, sales were $854 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars and 15% organically versus prior year. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. In the Communications Solutions segment, sales were $1.127 billion in the quarter, which was a decrease of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 20.5%. In the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment, sales were $993 million in the first quarter, which was an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars inorganically versus the prior year. Segment operating margin was 18%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 20.9%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.8% and 24.5% in the first quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.71 compared to $0.68 in the prior year period, and adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.69 compared to $0.67 in the first quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $532 million or 125% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $436 million or 102% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 93, 72 and 52 days, respectively. The higher inventory days were primarily driven by the lower sales level in the first quarter together with some continued impacts from the supply chain disruptions that our industry experienced over the past year. Our management team is focused on bringing the inventory days back down to a more normal range over the coming quarters. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $79. And when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of 2023 was more than $290 million. Total debt at March 31 was $4.6 billion, and net debt was $3.1 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, which includes cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. First quarter EBITDA was $708 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and allow me to extend my welcome to all of you on the phone here today. And I hope you all are all enjoying a lovely spring so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets, and then make some comments on our outlook for the second quarter. And then, of course, we'll have time for some questions at the end. With respect to the first quarter, our results were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our sales grew from prior year by 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency, reaching $2.974 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 1%, with growth in commercial air, broadband, military, automotive and industrial markets, largely offset by declines in the IT datacom, mobile networks and mobile devices markets. The company booked just under $2.9 billion in orders in the quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.97:1. Our operating margins, adjusted operating margins in the quarter reached 20.1%, and that was a 10 basis point increase from last year's levels. As Craig just mentioned, we achieved a still very robust level of profitability despite the ongoing cost challenges around the world, as well as declining volumes in many of our communications markets, and this is just an excellent reflection of the strength of our company's execution in these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 3% from prior year to $0.69, and we generated strong operating cash flow of $532 million and $436 million, respectively, in the quarter, all clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I'm just extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians around the world. The company's results this quarter once again reflects the discipline and agility of our uniquely entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well in a very dynamic and challenging environment. Now turning to our progress across our various served markets, I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the worldwide electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risk associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% organically. And this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 2%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the first quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. We remain very encouraged by the strength of the company's position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's broadest range of high-technology interconnect products. As the geopolitical environment has become certainly more dynamic, nations around the world are expanding their investments in next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential. We look forward to supporting this increased demand with our wide array of interconnect and sensor products, together with our expanded capacity, resulting from the investments that we've made in recent years. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 42% from prior year and 44% organically as we benefited from the continued recovery in global aircraft production. And while aircraft production may not yet be back to the levels that it was before the pandemic, we are very pleased that after several very challenging years in this market, our team has driven our sales essentially back to pre-crisis levels, a really great achievement. Sequentially, our sales grew by a much better-than-expected 15% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to remain at these first quarter levels. I'm just so grateful to our team who works in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft, are paying real dividends. And we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives here in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 28% of our sales in the quarter. And our sales in this market grew from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency and 5% organically. This growth was driven, in particular, by sales into traditional and alternative energy generation, heavy equipment, rail mass transit, factory automation and medical applications, together with contributions from our acquisition program. On a sequential basis, sales were up 2% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations. And as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as we saw here in the first quarter. Our outstanding global team working across the industrial market, continues to find new opportunities for growth across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering both organically and through complimentary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that are happening around the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come, the automotive market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the first quarter grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% organically with our growth supported once again by strength of our sales into electrified vehicle applications, together with other products sold into a wide array of new electronic systems in cars. While sales in Asia were slightly down from prior year, we realized strong growth in North America and Europe in the automotive market. Sequentially, our sales declined by 5% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, and that just reflected strong execution by our team in reacting to opportunities with customer demand. For the second quarter, we expect a modest sequential increase in sales from these levels. And I just have to say that I remain truly impressed by our team working in the automotive market. They continue to grow our global position by remaining focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. In particular, our long-term efforts at expanding our now comprehensive range of next generation interconnect products that are incorporated into electrified vehicles has enabled us to expand our position with a wide range of customers, all of whom are pursuing carbon neutral driving solutions and that creates further potential for the business. The mobile devices market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter, and sales declined by 15% from prior year as growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales into laptops, tablets, and wearables. Sequentially, our sales declined by a slightly better than expected 31% from the fourth quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further mid-teen sales decline from these first quarter levels. There's no question that the mobile devices market remains one of our most volatile. Nevertheless, our outstanding and agile team has adjusted their resources in real-time with the changing levels of demand and stands poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2023 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and precision mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined from prior year by 19% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically as operators and equipment manufacturers reduced their demand after several quarters of stronger consumption. Sequentially, our sales in the first quarter were down by 11% from the fourth quarter, which was a bit more than we had expected coming into the quarter. And now as we look into the second quarter, we do expect a further low double-digit sequential decline in sales as operators further moderate their spending. Our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment, as well as the networks being constructed around the world. And while there is currently seemingly a pause in the investment cycle when customers once again drive renewed construction of these advanced systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 17% of sales in the quarter, and sales did decline by 21% in U.S. dollars and organically as both service providers and equipment manufacturers moderated their demand in light of still significant levels of inventory across the market. On a sequential basis, sales declined 17% from the fourth quarter, which was a touch better than our expectation of 20% down coming into the quarter. And as we look towards the second quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels. Regardless of this current correction in demand largely due to inventory, we remain encouraged by the company's outstanding position in the global IT datacom market. Our team's just done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. With exciting new applications, including in particular alternative intelligence or AI, together with the continued growth in overall data traffic, we're confident that we'll be able to realize the benefits of our leading position in this important market for many years to come. And finally, the broadband communications market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew by a very strong 17% from prior year and 18% organically as we experienced a significant increase in demand from cable operators for a wide range of our products. This growth was driven by increased network build-outs as well as our customers preparing for new government supported spending on expanded broadband coverage, particularly here in North America. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 15%, slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we anticipate a mid-single digit sequential moderation of sales from these first quarter levels as broadband operators temper their procurement levels. Nevertheless, we remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strong and expanded position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook. The current economic environment remains for sure dynamic and highly uncertain. In addition, we do expect reduce demand to continue in the second quarter across the communications related markets. Assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $2.890 billion to $2.950 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. This would represent a year-over-year sales decline of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS decline of 9% to 12% again compared to the second quarter of prior year. Nevertheless, I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t take this opportunity to offer my true gratitude to our entire global team around the world for their outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And operator with that, we\u2019d be very happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Please limit to one question per caller. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I hope you could expand a bit more on the communication segment softness that you\u2019re seeing. I think we\u2019ve talked about the IT datacom softness for a few quarters, now it sounds like maybe it\u2019s incrementally there on the mobile network side as well. Would love to get your perspective if you think this is more demand driven or inventory driven issue, and then from your vantage point, what do you think is the duration of this softness of correction as you go forward? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Amit. And for sure, I mean, our team working in the communications market has been wrestling with quite some vacillations in demand. And if you just look back over the prior couple of years, we had just fabulous, fabulous growth in all the communications market, in particular in IT datacom, but we also had strong growth in mobile networks and decent growth in the mobile devices. And I think what we\u2019ve seen as we came into the end of last year and certainly coming into this quarter that in particular in the IT datacom market, there is a significant \u2013 there was a significant degree of overbuying of components. Not because we had disappointed our customers, quite the contrary. We were constantly coming to the rescue of our customers over the course of their boom and demand with the agility that they\u2019ve come to expect from Amphenol. But regardless, they seem to have opened their aperture of procurement across virtually everything that they buy in light of the supply chain crisis. And that included building up inventory of our products certainly, which we saw with hindsight. Relative to the mobile networks market, I\u2019d say this is not as much an inventory issue as it is the dynamics of service provider spending. And I think it\u2019s kind of well reported the ups and downs of the various service providers and their capital plans. And I think what we\u2019ve seen in particular in mobile networks as we\u2019ve seen the early stages of operators building out their 5G networks and we benefited no doubt about it from that build-out with the long-term efforts that we put in to build our position across those next generation systems. And sometimes what you see is initial build-outs and then they digest it and they figure out the economics and then they come once again to build-out a next phase. And I would tell you that in most of the places where we operate places like North America, Europe, and otherwise, these 5G networks are certainly not fully built-out quite the contrary, but they\u2019ve built out the rough framework of them. It allows them to get a certain amount of coverage, start to realize a certain amount of economic return for their investments, and then as typically happens, they would at a certain point start to do further investments to build up more capacity in those networks. And when that happens, we\u2019ll be well equipped to deal with that. I mean, the other communications market mobile devices, this is one that is very volatile. We saw in particular last quarter still really robust strength in smartphones, but that was offset or more than offset by fairly dramatic declines in the overall demand for computing devices like laptops and tablets. And I think that\u2019s also a well reported dynamic with the kind of pull forward of demand of those kind of devices as everybody went to work from home. And if our office is any indication, work from home is a distant memory because as Craig and I come into the office, the parking lot is full, the cubicles and the offices are quite full here. And so I think that mad rush to equip people for working from home with those various devices, has a little bit change the cycle of replacement of them and maybe bunched a bit more into the prior two years. And then last I\u2019ll talk about is broadband, which is our kind of fourth of the communications markets. We had just outstanding performance in broadband last year and that continued here into the first quarter. And that was really supporting our customers with a really broad array of products. We\u2019ve dramatically expanded the range of products that we sell into the broadband market. And that resulted in us taking significant position with our customers. I mean, we grew, as you\u2019ll recall, very well last year by 38% organically in 62% in U.S. dollars with the variety of acquisitions that we\u2019ve made in recent times and still robust double-digit organic growth here in the first quarter. And I think now we see a little bit of digestion of those customers as we look into the second quarter. But no doubt about it, the position that we\u2019ve built over the last couple of years in broadband is something that we think long-term is going to create great value for the company. Operator : And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Adam, curious as to why you think this weakness is contained within communications. I mean, you are so diversified even within communications, radio, consumer exposure and mobile. You have enterprise and cloud exposure and IT datacom, carrier exposure and mobile networks. Given that, like why is this \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s a very broad macro kind of slowdown. Is this just more early cycle given some of the inventory things that you noted and we should expect some moderation even in industrial and auto and other areas as we go through the course of the year. Is that the right way to think about it? And if I could, would love to get your perspective on trends in China as well I\u2019m not sure if you had a chance to get over there, but you typically do. And now that it\u2019s opened up if you have or even if you\u2019re not, it would be great to get some perspective on what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in China. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Wamsi. Look, I don\u2019t think that the communications markets and the dynamics that I just discussed, which are quite unique in each of them. We\u2019re talking about one dynamic in IT datacom and different in mobile networks, a different again in devices, and yet again in broadband. I wouldn\u2019t say that that is an indicative or leading indicator for a broad economic situation. Quite contrary, we\u2019ve given guidance for next quarter for all of our markets. And I don\u2019t think that that guidance reflects a kind of a broad economic slowdown, quite the contrary. Relative to China, I mean, I\u2019m glad you asked the question. It was just early last month when China changed its visa policies and as soon as the news came out that visas were reenacted literally that day we booked our flights and Craig and I were in China at the very first day of April, and what a pleasure it was. I can\u2019t tell you to be three years away from our team in China who just did such a phenomenal, phenomenal job over these three very challenging years. In particular, over last year, which was particularly challenging in certain places, including in Shanghai. I tell you, I had the opportunity to meet some of our factory workers who went into a bubble in Shanghai for more than six weeks in one case. And just to be able to see them and to be honest, to like hug them and thank them for all what they did on behalf of the company during that time period was just a tremendous, tremendous satisfaction for me. Not to mention Craig and I, somehow we didn\u2019t gain weight with all the food that we ate over that week of visiting 21 of our operations in China. But the trends in China, I tell you being there on the ground, this does not seem like a place that is going into deep recessions. Infrastructure investments continue apace. You see new rails for high speed trains next to virtually every highway you go on. And what I was most impressed by was our own operations and what they have done during this time period when nobody was visiting them. And it\u2019s a credit to how we are organized as a company that we don\u2019t have just subsidiary factories that are relying on a whole infrastructure outside of China to function, but rather we have standalone entrepreneurial organizations like we do around the world run by general managers and their teams and what amazing work they did over this time, driving growth in technology, developing new products for the China market, not relying on Western countries or engineers who may be subject to government restrictions that can be applied from anywhere that you think of, but rather developing native capabilities inside of Amphenol. Also, many of our Chinese operations had during that time for a variety of reasons, the incentive to set up operations outside of China, and doing that while still not being able to travel, going to a place like Vietnam or to India or to Thailand or even Mexico and setting up satellite factories on behalf of their customers who wanted to have China Plus One or something like that. It was just really exceptional to see that. And another reminder of what really makes this company special. Are there trends in China? Are there macro issues, long-term things like population growth or lack thereof? Sure. Are there geopolitics that are sitting kind of at the highest levels between Beijing and Washington? Sure they are. But I can tell you, when you go on the ground, you meet with the people there, you get really encouraged as I do everywhere that I go around Amphenol, from the U.S. to Mexico to India, to Western Europe, and now finally being able to go back to China, and I look forward to going back again soon. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi thanks for taking my question. Adam, just wanted to see if I can get some of your thoughts about how you\u2019re thinking sort of for the second half of the year with the guidance that you have for 2Q, the first half, you\u2019re going to be down a bit year-over-year. But the orders have now stabilized. Is that giving you a bit more visibility into the opportunities for growth or the opportunity for the aggregate company to grow in the second half or maybe even for the full year, any thoughts there? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thank you very much, Samik. Look, I mean, we\u2019re not giving full year guidance because it does remain a very volatile environment. And so as much as I would love to sort of get out ahead of my skis and tell you that the second half is going to give growth or not give growth, I\u2019m going to refrain from doing that here today. But I can tell you this that the company remains strong. The base of our strength with customers, the financial condition of the company, I mean just look at the margins that we were able to secure in the first quarter despite real volatility that we saw in our communications market. And Craig mentioned that very specifically. I mean it\u2019s just another testament to the underlying strength of the company. So to the extent that in the second half, customers want more product from us, for sure, we\u2019re going to support them with that. But I think today, sitting here just on the 26th of April, it\u2019s premature given how dynamic it is for me to give a sense of what Q3 and Q4 and, ultimately, the full year is going to bring. You can bet our team has high aspirations, but we\u2019re also realistic to the environment that\u2019s in front of us, and we\u2019re going to manage through whatever comes our way. Operator : And our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi good afternoon. Adam, I was just looking back at your earnings track record for the long period of time. If I take out the COVID period, the early COVID period, you\u2019re experiencing a down year of earnings for the first time since 2009. And I was just curious what you think about this cycle relative to prior cycles where your earnings are down, and what steps you\u2019re going to take to maybe sort of mute that earnings decline in coming quarters? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks so much, Steve. I mean, look, we\u2019ll see how the year goes. As I just said to Samik, I have no idea, and certainly, I\u2019m not going to talk about what the full year earnings will be. But what I did say just now, I think really resonates when you bring up 2009. Because -- whether it was 2009 or even 2001, and you\u2019re probably one of the few people on the call who\u2019s been closely associated and following us since that time, and I certainly have been in the company for that time or longer, the way that Amphenolians manage through dynamics is to just face it up. We don\u2019t kind of punt it. We don\u2019t say, \"Well, the good times are going to come,\" or, \"let\u2019s wait another quarter, let\u2019s wait a third quarter and then we have to play catch-up and get behind kind of the curve of the cost.\" Rather, we see what orders we have, we see what our customers want. And if we have too few or too many resources, we make adjustments rapidly. And that gets reflected then in the profitability of the company. And as you know very well, what distinguished our company, whether it was in 2009, 2001 or in that sort of COVID environment of early in 2020 was from peak to trough, our margins declined just 300 basis points during very, very significant downturns in demand. Now we are certainly not with our guidance in the second quarter, guiding to such kind of cataclysm as we all saw in 2009. But at the same time, it\u2019s a dynamic world. And so our playbook hasn\u2019t changed whatsoever. Even if the size of the company is significantly bigger than it was in 2009 and categorically bigger than it was in 2001, our sort of modus operandi is the same that culture of entrepreneurship, which is, today, represented across 130 general managers, and maybe in 2009, it was like 50 and in 2001, it was like 20, it\u2019s still the same way to deal with it. These GMs are out with customers every day. They\u2019re listening to them. They\u2019re immediately coming back, reacting in real time to adjust resources accordingly. And then once -- if you have less orders, less demand, you take out cost, but then you go out and you take market share. And that\u2019s the approach of Amphenol. It has been my entire 25 years in this company, and it will be for as long as I can secure that. So who knows what it\u2019s going to be this year. We certainly don\u2019t aspire to have a reduction in our EPS. But if demand is softer than it was last year, we\u2019ll manage through it. Craig Lampo : Hey, Steve, this is Craig. And I think I just would add just one thing to that. I think that if you look in the first quarter results, and we\u2019ve said this a couple times. But if you look at the first quarter results and you take into account that we have three or four markets that are reducing sequentially by double digits. You really just see that resiliency from a margin perspective and the ability for the company to kind of react to those kind of reductions. I mean, the mobile devices market is certainly normally used to having kind of reductions like that. But places like IT, data, mobile networks, broadband, these are not markets that typically have that type of volatility from a quarter-to-quarter basis. And I think that you really as that kind of shows through just in the results for the first quarter. And as Adam said, I don\u2019t think that would be any different in the future. But the bottom line is we\u2019re driving for continued growth and we will react to demand reductions where that may be. Operator : Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Adam, hoping you could just comment on the focus areas specifically for the IT datacom group right now, as the market goes through this consolidation period, is the fact that you\u2019re able to catch your breath after what you already referenced today as a very busy multi-year period. In some respects, is that actually a positive relative to the longer-term positioning of the business? I guess, if I look at the margin side, 27% decremental margins for communication solutions could have been worse. And then on the demand side, looks like there\u2019s some interesting AI related opportunities that are emerging on the horizon. If you could speak to both those things? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Luke, well, thank you very much. I\u2019m glad you emphasize this. I mean, this 27% downside conversion margin for an organization that is already making pretty robust margins is really phenomenal. And by any measure, it\u2019s a reflection of that quick reactivity that I was discussing earlier. Luke, I would be lying if I told you our folks working in that market are happy to have a little bit of a downturn to kind of to use your phrase, catch their breath. Nobody likes dealing with this. But we do it. It is what it is. Like it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t sort of punt reality. It just is what it is. At the same time though, what\u2019s interesting is while we\u2019re making sure that the financial strength of the company is stays as robust as it did, and again, the 27% convergent margin that you mentioned is a great indicator of that. We are working on an extraordinary array of next generation technologies. Just because customers have some extra inventory doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have an enormous amount of next generation things that they\u2019re trying to achieve. And you mentioned, and I think I alluded to, AI as one of those, I mean, these are the kind of revolutions that drive kind of quantum leaps in the demands of our customers for processor power, for speed as it relates to data transmission and networking, all of which creates demands on the equipment for next generation high speed interconnect for the fiber optics and for the high efficiency power interconnect that\u2019s so important to sustaining the operating expenses and let alone the carbon footprint of these massive processors that are going into these enormous data centers. And so we haven\u2019t slowed down at all as it relates to developing and designing next generation products together with our customers. And you could actually argue that in certain cases we\u2019ve had to accelerate those efforts as customers have gotten into competitive situations with others on things like AI, machine learning and alike. And that\u2019s the kind of carrying water on both shoulders that is an Amphenol in trait as well. It\u2019s not something necessarily. I emphasize so much. But we talk a lot in the company about driving with one foot on the gas, one on the brake, carrying water on both shoulders. Sometimes you got to go out and cut costs at the very same time as you\u2019re ramping up engineering support for next generation systems. And being able to do that, having the mindset and the agility to do that is I think a very unique trait that is resident inside our organization. And that includes within all of those working across IT datacom. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on IT datacom, obviously that\u2019s been a segment that\u2019s been I guess the most impacted so far by inventory digestion. I think in Q1 you guys said it was down about 17% sequentially. And if I heard it right, it sounds like the subsegment is going to be actually be flat sequentially in Q2. And I know there\u2019s seasonality involved, but does that indicate that subsegment is moving past maybe the bulk of some of the inventory, digestion headwinds that have impacted the segment over the last three, four quarters now? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks. Thanks, Chris. Look, I\u2019ve talked a lot about IT datacom, but to the specific of your question, I mean, I don\u2019t know what the second half is going to bring. I certainly hope that Q2 and the fact that we see sales to be flat is an indication that we've kind of reached a kind of a little bit more of an equilibrium. 90 days from now, I hope to be able to give you a better sense of that as it relates to the second half. But it's certainly a better indication than if we had seen another leg down on a sequential basis. So we'll see what the second half brings. Again, the fact that it's flat in the second quarter gives me some hope, but 90 days from now we'll try to give you a little more certainty about that. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. William Stein : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to just linger on these relatively weaker end markets for a moment, just to get slightly more clarity. And the weakness in comms, in general are you seeing that more pronounced in any particular geography? And within IT datacom specifically, is that more hyperscalers where you're seeing the weakness? Or is it more broad-based across all sizes and shapes of customers? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Will. I wouldn't point out any significant geographical distinction across the communications markets. I mean remember that a lot of these communications products they do get that \u2013 a lot of them still get made in Asia, especially on the device side and a good portion of the \u2013 at least the OEM products of the IT datacom. So you can imagine that in Asia, that's having a worse situation overall for the company. And sure enough in Asia, our \u2013 we did not have as robust performance in the quarter as we did in North America and Europe overall and that's driven a lot by that. But otherwise, I wouldn't say that there's any sort of end customer geographic changes here. Relative to hyperscale versus the equipment manufacturers, again, I don't think there's a real distinction because ultimately the hyperscale people are also customers for the equipment manufacturers in many cases. And I think that that overall inventory position is fairly broad across both areas of that market. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to touch a little bit more on supply chain and what it might mean for your own free cash flow generation. Given demand softer, do you think supply chain stabilizing enough that perhaps you can take inventory down and lead to better free cash flow here? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks Mark. Yes, I mean, in Q1 we actually had good cash flow, I mean 100% essentially of our yield on for the first quarter, which for the first quarter actually is probably better than average. But given that, I do recognize that our inventory was even a little bit higher than we would typically wanted to see here in the first quarter from a day's perspective. And the team is \u2013 there's many reasons for that. I mean we had certainly a very strong 2022. We had supply chain issues throughout the majority of the year of 2022. And I think that as we came into the first quarter, where days typically get higher. Normally, there certainly is kind of a lag effect or a hangover effect from a supply chain perspective as well. And I do believe that the team certainly will have some impact on that over the coming quarters, and we should see some improvement from a day's perspective on inventory, which just naturally will help from a cash flow. But I think our target cash flow continues to be 100%, or 90% to 100% kind of from a free cash flow perspective. And I think that certainly, that should be achievable here and for the full year, and there may be a quarter or two where we're actually a little higher than that as we kind of bring inventory a bit down. Operator : And our last question today comes from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead. Guy Hardwick : Hi, good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Hi, Guy. Guy Hardwick : Could you expand a little bit on the industrial segment, which is now by far away your largest segment, I think you had 28% of sales. I know factory automation is probably the largest end market within that, but can you give us a little bit more color on trends within industrial, whether it's medical or energy? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Guy. I mean the fact is as industrial is at least this quarter our largest segment, it was 28% of our sales. At the same time, industrial is far and away our most diversified market. I mean there's really not a correlation amongst the various segments within Industrial, except that they all represent harsh environments where our customers are trying to push new electronics deeper and deeper into some of the harshest of environments to an offshore wind mill, into a semiconductor factory, into an operating theater, onto a train going 400 kilometers an hour and everything in between. In terms of the segments, I wouldn't say that necessarily factory automation is the largest. It's a significant segment, but we have strong sales in the areas like heavy equipment and medical, instrumentation, which includes things like semiconductor manufacturing into electric vehicles, heavy electric vehicles and battery. All times of \u2013 types of energy generation and that includes both alternative energy, but also traditional energy extraction and generation, rail mass, transit, things like marine and entertainment? I mean, and you can tell these are not markets that correlate with one another. So if we're going to have one of our markets be a little bit bigger than the others, and in this case, still just 28% of sales, this would be the one that you'd want to have that. And we're just really excited by the progress that we've made in our industrial market over a very long time period. If I go back to 20 years ago, I mean this was a relatively small business that we didn't really have a close touch with where it went. It all went through distribution. And we had just fabulous leadership in our industrial business over that time who really drove a very much an application and segment-based approach to developing new products, application-specific, technology-specific products. At the same time, as we made a number of great acquisitions over many years, and we continue to make great acquisitions across the industrial market that have ultimately positioned us for this just multitude of revolutions going on as electronics gets pushed deeper and deeper into harsher and harsher environments. And so it's not just one or another piece of that, and we're just really excited about the ongoing strength of our industrial market, which has just been a fabulous asset for the company for many years, and I believe will remain so for many years to come. Operator : We do have one additional question from Michael Anastasiou with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Michael Anastasiou : Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the capital deployment side, you had a couple deals announced at the beginning of the year. Can you just describe how CRM and RFS into the overall strategy? And on the broader front, what end markets or adjacencies, do you see the most opportunity inorganically for the year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Michael. Well, CMR, as we announced, we closed earlier in the year, and that's a fabulous company making harsh environment, value-add interconnect products that go into the industrial market, in particular, in heavy equipment. RFS, we announced that we signed the acquisition, but we have not yet closed it. We \u2013 as we said last quarter, we expect to close by the end of the second quarter, and we don't change what we say about that. And RFS really expands our position in the mobile networks market with really high-technology antennas and fiber optic solutions that go into next-generation mobile networks. And we're, again, very excited about that company, and our team continues to work closely with the RFS team as we get closer to bring them into the Amphenol family. In terms of our pipeline of acquisitions and where we see the future, we don't pick and choose our markets and say, well, that's the market where we want to make acquisitions or, that's the market where we don't want to make acquisitions. And the reason for that is when we make an acquisition, we're getting married forever. We're not a trader where we buy companies and sell them and buy and sell and kind of do this portfolio management. We look for companies with great people, with outstanding enabling technologies and robust and complementary market positions across all of our end markets. And in our experience, which stretches over, in my career, more than 75 acquisitions, and I think more than 50 since I've been CEO in these 15 years nearly, that \u2013 having that very simple approach leads to really outstanding long-term success and a great return on our capital that we deploy towards the M&A program. Our acquisition pipeline remains very robust today. I remain wholly incapable of predicting when we will close and if we will close certain deals. But I know that long-term, the program is going to continue to support really great growth for the company and a great use of the capital and the cash that we generate so much of. And so we look very much forward to continuing our M&A program, and it really complements the culture of the company as well because every time we bring in one of these new entrepreneurs, it actually strengthens the entrepreneurial culture of Amphenol. And that's something that I look very much forward to as well. Craig Lampo : And Michael, just to clarify, just to avoid any confusion, RFS, since we have not closed on it yet, is not included in our guidance and it wouldn't be included in guidance until we close. Adam Norwitt : Well, very good. I think we have no further questions, operator. And so if that's the case, I would like to take this opportunity to wish all of you a wonderful continuation of your spring and we look forward to talking to you all just 90 days from now. Thank you so much, and best wishes to you all. Craig Lampo : Thanks, everybody. Operator : And thank you for attending today's conference, and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. And welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 conference call. Our second quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the second quarter with sales of $3,054 million and GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.74 and $0.72, respectively. Second quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and organically -- and 4% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3,044 million, which was down 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022, but up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1 :1. GAAP operating income was $620 million in the second quarter of 2023, which included $4 million of acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $624 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.3% and 20.4%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. And on an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased 30 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong downside conversion on the sales -- lower sales volumes, as well as the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which are currently operating below the corporate average. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continues to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. During the second quarter, we were excited to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of RFS. The value of the net assets we acquired were in excess of the RFS purchase price. And as a result, we recorded a noncash gain of $5 million in the second quarter, which has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. In the third quarter of 2023, we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with RFS, which we estimate will be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. These costs will be excluded from our third quarter adjusted EPS results and are excluded from our Q3 2023 guidance. Breaking down second quarter results by segment, relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $889 million and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically and segment operating margin was 27%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1,162 million and declined by 16% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 20.5%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1,003 million and increased by 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 18.5%. The company\u2019s GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 21.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 23.3% and 24.5% in the second quarter of 2022, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.74, compared to $0.76 in the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased -- decreased 4% to $0.72, compared to $0.75 in the second quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $536 million or 120% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $442 million or nearly 100% of adjusted net income. We are very pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87 days, 71 days and 48 days, respectively. Through the focused attention of our management team during the quarter, we were able to bring inventory days back in line with our normal range. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $77. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2023 was $280 million. Total debt on June 30th was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.8 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.8 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.5 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Second quarter 2023 EBITDA was $736 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s financial position remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I\u2019d like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today on this beautiful summer day here in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I do hope that all of you on the call, together with your family, friends and colleagues are enjoying a little bit of your summer thus far. As Craig mentioned, I am going to highlight some of our achievements in the second quarter. I will then spend a moment to discuss our trends and the progress across our served markets and make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter, and then obviously, we will have time for questions at the end. With respect to the second quarter, our results were better than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales declined 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currency reaching $3,054 million, with growth in commercial air, military and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, slightly more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, IT datacom and mobile devices segments. On an organic basis, sales did decline by 4%. We are very pleased that the company booked orders in the quarter of $3.44 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of 1 :1. As Craig described, our margins in the quarter, adjusted operating margins were 20.4%, which was down 30 basis points from prior year, but which improved by 30 basis points from the first quarter sequentially. I am very pleased that our margins in the second quarter once again reflected outstanding execution by our global management team, who continue to quickly adjust to changing demand and costs amidst these very dynamic times. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter of 72% -- $0.72 declined 4% from prior year but increased 4% from the sequential prior quarter. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow of $536 million and $442 million in the second quarter, yet another demonstration of the high quality of the company\u2019s earnings. I am extremely proud of the Amphenol team around the world. Our results this quarter once again reflect the strength of our Amphenolian entrepreneurial organization, as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic and challenging environment. We are pleased to announce today that we closed the previously announced acquisition of the North American cable and global base station antenna business of RFS. Despite some current moderation in the mobile networks market, we remain excited about the long-term prospects of RFS as part of the Amphenol family. We now expect this acquisition to generate roughly $30 million of sales in the second half of 2023. In addition, we are pleased that just in the last few days, we closed on the acquisition of EBY Electro. EBY is based in the state of New York in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $15 million. And EBY is a designer and distributor of terminal block interconnect products to the North American industrial market. The addition of EBY further expands our offering of high technology interconnect products into the diversified industrial market. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, we remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions, and successfully bring these new organizations into the Amphenol organization remains a core competitive advantage for us. Now turning to the trends and progress across our served markets. We are very pleased that the company\u2019s end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. In particular, in hits these very dynamic times, Amphenol\u2019s end market diversification continues to create great value for the company. The military market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew by a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 8%. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to remain at these robust second quarter levels. I just have to say that we remain very encouraged by the strength of the company\u2019s position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry\u2019s widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today\u2019s highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We continue to make targeted investments to expand our capacity and look forward to supporting this increased demand with our broad product offering. Turning to the commercial aerospace market. This market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and we had another very strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 40% in U.S. dollar and organically from prior year, as we benefited from both the continued recovery in global aircraft production, as well as our ongoing efforts to expand our position within this market. Sequentially, our sales grew 9% from the first quarter, which was much better than expectations coming into Q2. We are also very pleased that in the second quarter, our commercial air business was able to reach its highest ever level of quarterly sales. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these strong second quarter levels and I am just truly grateful to our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends and we look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives in 2023 and beyond. The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market were flat in U.S. dollars and local currencies, but did decline by 7% organically, as growth in medical, transportation, oil and gas, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments was more than offset by moderations across the other segments of the industrial market together with lower sales to the distribution channel. On a sequential basis, sales declined 3% from the first quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations. This reflected some incremental slowing of demand from certain customers, in particular, in factory automation and heavy equipment. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these second quarter levels. Nevertheless, and despite this positive demand, I am very proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many distinct segments of this exciting and truly diverse market. I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. We look forward to realizing the benefits of this strategy for many years to come. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and sales in this market grew 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. This was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7% from the first quarter and this was slightly better than our expectations coming into Q2. For the third quarter, we expect sales to be roughly at the same level as we achieved here in the second quarter and I am just really proud of our team working in automotive. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles and this includes electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. The mobile device market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and our sales did moderate by 8% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically in the second quarter, as strength in smartphones and related products was more than offset by declines in tablets and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 3%, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-teens decline that we had coming into the quarter. As we now look into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase sequentially in the mid-teens from these second quarter levels on seasonal strength. While there\u2019s no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile of end markets, our team once again in the second quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the second half of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 24% in U.S. dollars and 32% organically as we manage through the expected and broad-based weakness in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales in the second quarter declined by 6%, which was a touch better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we now expect sales to remain at roughly similar levels as we achieved here in the second quarter. Look, there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s a challenging short-term wireless investment environment. But nevertheless, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks. With now the addition of RFS together with our already broad array of products, when customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and while sales did decline by 24% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually better than we had expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, sales increased by 6%, which was in excess of our expectations for sales to be flat. This sequential uptick in sales was driven by a surge in demand from customers accelerating their investments in AI-focused systems or alternative intelligence -- artificial intelligence, which offset somewhat weaker demand in more traditional markets. We also saw robust orders for AI-related applications, which is a strong affirmation of our team\u2019s success in positioning Amphenol as a true leader in the interconnect systems that support AI. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase modestly from these second quarter levels. While we are continuing to manage through the inventory adjustment in the broader IT market, we are more encouraged than ever by the company\u2019s position in this important space. Whether enabling the current surge in AI-related installations or the broader range of Internet-enabling networks, our team has done an outstanding job developing leading high speed, power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales were flat from prior year and up just 1% organically as broadband operators tempered their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales declined by 2%, which was modestly better than our expectations. Now looking into the third quarter, we do expect a mid-single-digit sequential decline in sales as operators moderate their spending following several quarters of strong demand and investments. Regardless of this momentary pause in demand, we do remain encouraged by the company\u2019s strengthened position in the broadband market and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, there remains a significant amount of government funded initiatives, particularly in North America, which gives us confidence for the future of the broadband market. Now turning to our outlook and assuming the current market environment does not meaningfully worsen and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the third quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $3.040 billion to $3.100 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. This would represent a sales decline of 6% to 8% and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 8% to 10% compared to the third quarter of 2022. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our composition while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long-term. Finally, and really most importantly, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Amphenol team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And Operator, at this time, we would be very happy to take any questions that there may be. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, given all of the attention on AI recently. Just was hoping you can help us better understand the materiality to Amphenol based on what you look, so far amid what you are calling the surge, I guess. Quantitatively, I am thinking in terms of percentage of sales, either relative to IT datacom or maybe even relative to the company, overall? And then qualitatively, just any perspective on sizing the longer opportunity -- longer-term opportunity from your point of view given what\u2019s clearly very early innings right now and just understanding how it\u2019s scaling in the business near term would be very helpful? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, Luke, thank you very much. Yeah. Look, without putting specific numbers on to sub-segments of our end markets, I will just tell you that as we came into the second quarter, we had a certain expectation to be flat. And I would tell you that kind of the underlying IT business was maybe even a touch weaker as customers continue to manage through inventory that had built up over the last couple of years. Yet we ended up growing sequentially by 6%. And really, all of that upside -- more than just that upside came really from the near-term demand that we are seeing from a variety of customers who are building out their AI-related systems. In addition, we had a book-to-bill overall for the company of 1 :1, but we had a very strong book-to-bill in our IT datacom market. I would tell you, it was about 1.1:1 in IT datacom, where we saw just really strong bookings, which gives us confidence as we guided in the third quarter to be sequentially up. And so I\u2019d say that it\u2019s -- while it\u2019s not the dominant thing in our IT datacom market far from it, because it\u2019s really -- as you say, the early innings. We see the investments in AI as being a real significant dynamic for our company in the future -- in the near-term and in the future and to think about why that is you really have to get to the architecture of these AI systems. In particular, as customers build out these very intensive systems with these GPUs and otherwise, they built them out in a structure that requires just an enormous amount of interconnect. They call it kind of a fabric, if you will, of interconnect, where you have -- you are creating effectively a neural network. And in the neural network, everything has to connect to everything else and it has to do that with high speed and low latency, while using as little power as possible and that just puts an enormous premium on the highest of technology, high speed products, on the most efficient interconnect -- power interconnect and these are all things where Amphenol has a strong leadership position in the industry. Look, long-term, I think, we are in the early euphoria of AI right now and I don\u2019t want to kind of try to prognosticate what AI will mean, let alone what it will mean sort of ethically and more -- metaphysically and all of those things, but what we know for sure is it requires a lot of interconnect today. And as our customers are building on these networks, we stand ready to react to them in real time to make sure that they can stay competitive in a world that has become a real -- a significant dynamic for our customers. Many of them see this kind of existentially and when they need us the most is when we step up to the plate always as Amphenol and are there for our customers. And I think that means that as they continue those investments long term, they will continue to turn to us as really their first phone call. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I am just curious about the industrial segment and this segment you were not very long ago doing double-digit organic growth. It\u2019s obviously moderated since then. This quarter, I think, you had a decline is what you said. I mean how much of this is attributable to inventory digestion of the distributors versus essentially some of the demand -- direct demand from some of the end markets starting to turn negative and any thoughts in terms of when you start to sort of cycle past those individual drivers in terms of timing? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thank you very much, Samik. I think we talked at least last quarter about the fact that we started to see some signs of a little bit of -- some early signs of a little bit of inventory in the industrial market including with our distributors. And no doubt about it, when we look at our results here in the second quarter, where we weren\u2019t in U.S. dollars flat, but organically, we were down by 7%. There is some element of that which comes from distributors managing a bit more of their inventory across the industrial market. And then there are a few segments of the industrial market where I think it\u2019s been well reported that there\u2019s a bit of softness in area like factory automation, on a year-over-year basis, something like instrumentation, where even if there\u2019s been this euphoria around semiconductor capital equipment, for example, there have also been pockets of that market where you have seen real pullbacks in CapEx. I think it\u2019s a market where long-term, there\u2019s a great degree of optimism about the long-term in semiconductor equipment, but there are some short-term vacillations that have been going on in the last quarter or two. Those are areas that maybe I would highlight. I think that our position in industrial remains very broad. We continue to have parts of the industrial market that are performing extremely well. In fact, we saw great growth in areas like rail mass transit, alternative energy, even oil and gas, believe it or not, medical continues to be a very strong area for us. And a credit to our team for never going kind of all in on any one segment of the industrial market, but rather continuing that long-term drive to be as present as possible with the broadest range of products as possible. And to the extent that -- to your question about how long that cycle, may be hard for me to guess. I mean I think we have had similar questions about IT datacom in the past. Here, I think, you have certainly some correction that is happening with distributors, whether that is a one quarter, two quarter, three quarter, hard for me to guess and we will certainly let you know as soon as we have a better view of that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Is there anything in particular that has been helping gross margins such as price/cost mix or the integration of acquisitions or the gross margin in 2Q was at the highest in about five years, even as a handful of end markets are still soft. So I am hoping to better understand what may be positively impacting margins and then any color you can see on how to expect either gross or EBIT margins to trend going forward? Craig Lampo : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. No. We are -- I mean, we are really just proud of kind of this overall profitability here in the second quarter. I mean we converted on a sequential basis just under 35%, which is certainly far eating kind of our 25% kind of goal on higher sales and year-over-year, the negative version is 30%, which was certainly roughly kind of what we kind of expect on the downside. But if you actually peel acquisitions away from that, it\u2019s really even much better than this 30% that we certainly reported in U.S. dollars here. So, I think, overall, the profitability just of the company just continues to be very robust and really just -- is really because of the great work of the management team to be able to continue to protect the bottomline when we have some markets like communications market, specifically IT datacom that has on a year-over-year basis really seen some significant declines in mobile networks and mobile devices and of sort. So this is really just a great representation of the agility of the entire team to be able to have these robust margins in this environment. I mean specific to gross margins. We typically don\u2019t necessarily measure ourselves on gross margins or SG&A, we really do look at operating margin, which is kind of looking at all aspects of cost. But certainly, to your point, gross margins were higher this quarter than they have been over certainly the recent past. And I think that if you look at kind of the mix of our markets, our markets certainly do have -- our businesses that serve that certain markets do have sometimes higher gross margins or in high SG&A or lower gross margin and lower SG&A to kind of get to those operating margins that we expect and so times -- sometimes the mix of the sales in those markets could have an impact on the overall mix that you are talking about from a gross margin or SG&A perspective. I think we are seeing some of that in our business in the second quarter, where places like military and commercial air certainly very strong. But I think, overall, regardless of how they fluctuate kind of what we are focused on here is operating margin. So I think that, whether or not gross margin SG&A fluctuates a bit on a quarterly basis, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be concerned or be super focused on that. But at the end of the day, I think, really, what we are focused on is making sure that our operating margins continue to drive good, robust leverage on the higher sales and I think that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. And as we move forward, even our guidance implies really as strong, I think, conversion and leverage going into here the third quarter, and certainly, I think pricing over the last year has helped a bit with that. But I think that\u2019s kind of necessarily a new story, I think, we talked about us kind of catching up on pricing kind of later last year. So I wouldn\u2019t call that a 2023 story in terms of pricing. I think pricing cost at this point is relatively neutral, and certainly, we will react to anything that happens in the cost environment if that changes. But certainly, very happy with the overall margins and we are going to continue to march forward on that front. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Abdullah Khan with Evercore. You may go ahead. Abdullah Khan : Hi, everyone. Thanks a lot for the question. I wanted to ask about autos, and specifically, we have seen some auto OEMs take down inventories that were built up during the worst crisis of the supply chain. And so I wanted to get your perspective on that, if you have an estimate of how much inventory is overbuilt, if there is any, and as well as the various percentages around the end market? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thank you very much, Abdullah. Honestly, we don\u2019t have a good read on the auto OEM inventory, whether that\u2019s overbuilt or whether they are taking it down. I think what we know is that what our customers are taking from us and what we are able to support them with, and in the quarter, we were able to have a very strong -- yet another very strong quarter in automotive, growing by 9% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. And I think that\u2019s just a testament to our team\u2019s continued success in developing new products that go on new applications in the car. And so, to the extent that there is some vacillation that should come, if automakers decide to take more inventory or less inventory if they sell more cars or less cars, I mean, these are kind of things that are what they are. But what we can control is our position on these new applications on things like electrified drivetrains, on things like advanced safety, on things like advanced communication and so many other new applications going into cars. I mean I just got a new car recently and I still after a couple of weeks haven\u2019t figured out half of what the darn thing can do. And it just reminds me how many new systems are put into these cars, how many new applications and how much content for new products that weren\u2019t previously in a car. And we are seeing products being sold into cars that in the past, we were selling things that went into computers or to other advanced systems and all of a sudden they are being repackaged and repurposed to go into these cars where the continued growth in content is really explosive. And so I don\u2019t know, was inventory going down a little bit this quarter when we were going up 11% organically, maybe others have a better read on that than we do. But for sure, we continue to see strong momentum in automotive, and I think next quarter, we have once again a strong outlook in this market, and that\u2019s after several years of real outperformance to any comparable measure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. Adam, I know you mentioned it\u2019s a hard market to nail down seasonality, but if you think about seasonality in mobile devices and where you are guiding to in the mid-teens, that\u2019s the lowest level since 2016. It\u2019s at least 15 points below what you typically guide, or well, typically achieve anyway and when I sort of look at even 2016, that was a year where 2Q grew in the mid-teens, and you were coming off a much stronger base. So can you help us think through maybe what you are seeing today in terms of what seasonality it feels as though, at least from what we hear, at least on the PC side, there is a sequential improvement. So just wondering what the puts and takes are that you are seeing that\u2019s causing you to guide to good mid-teens over here? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Wamsi, thanks so much. I mean, look, I will put this maybe in a couple of contexts. One is that we came into the second quarter with an expectation for the market to be actually down in the mid-teens and we ultimately achieved on a sequential basis, close to 20 points better than that, growing by 3% sequentially. Yes, still down on a year-over-year basis, but very strong compared to our expectations and that strength really did come out of smartphones, in particular. And as we look at our guidance here for the third quarter, I think, you are arithmetically correct, that 17% sequential in the third quarter is maybe a touch lower than what we have seen in years past, maybe 2016 to the contrary notwithstanding. But if we break that down a little bit, I can just tell you this, that our expectation for our sales into smartphones is actually very robust, actually, I would say, even a little bit above our normal seasonality and that\u2019s offset by a more modest expectation in areas like tablets and laptops and other computing devices. And look, I don\u2019t know what the PC forecasts are, how those relate to, to the various devices that we are selling into. But one dynamic is, for sure, is that with COVID happening over the recent three years, there was a surge in demand for those products that were really used for home by people who are studying and working and otherwise communicating from home. And that kind of put a little bit of a hitch in the typical replacement cycle of a lot of these devices and I think we are still seeing a bit of a hangover from that right now in terms of the overall demand for those devices. Meanwhile, the smartphone products, our position on smartphones remains very robust and we see strong growth potential in smartphones going forward into the third quarter and that ultimately comes all together with this mid-teens expectation that we have on a sequential basis for the third quarter. Look, I mean, you can get pretty grey hair pretty quickly by trying to guess all the ins and outs of where the mobile device market is headed and we do our best job as we can in giving an outlook for that. But then once we give that outlook, as you know, our team is not resting on their laurels. They are ready at any time to capitalize on any upside that may come along or to manage through a downside that make it along as well and it remains our hardest market to forecast and guide to and it remains our team that is the most agile of any that I have ever seen in the industry. So I am confident going forward, that our team will continue to create great success and that our robust position in this market will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I wanted to asked about the military market, you have had some very strong double-digit growth here for a few quarters and your outlook continues to be strong. Could you talk about some of the drivers and maybe some of the programs and the diversification within those end markets? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Matt. No doubt about it, our team working in the military aerospace market or defense market, as I actually call it a lit bit often these days, is doing a great job. And it\u2019s interesting, we track, I don\u2019t know, kind of 10 or a dozen different sub-segments of that market. And about three quarters or even closer to like eight out of 10 of those markets grew in very strong double digits on a year-over-year basis last quarter, with just a couple of them a little bit lower performance. And it just reflects the real breadth of our position and the breadth of investments that countries around the world are making in new defense technologies. I mean, look, I look every day at what\u2019s happening with the tragedy in Ukraine. I looked with some anxiety at some of the other geopolitical tensions that are around the world. At the same time, I think, we at Amphenol look in the mirror and we feel very positive about the role that our team is directly playing in ensuring that the free people of the world get to remain free. And that reactivity of our team to grow by 19% organically on a year-over-year basis in a market with a product set that is not an easy product set to scale. I mean, these are products that are very complex to manufacture. They require an immense amount of qualifications and adherence to standards. They are very vertically integrated. And so to flex one\u2019s capacity in this market as we have done is really an extraordinary and one that is not lost on our customers in terms of our ability to really do what it takes and our willingness to invest when need be and to flex whenever possible to satisfy this really kind of existential demand that we are seeing in many cases. As I look forward in the defense market, I think, for better or for worse, I think, we are in an era today of more anxiety, more dynamics where more and more the nations that are allied with our country, with the Europeans and others are having to invest more significantly than ever before in next-generation defense technologies. And is the broadest manufacturer of those products, both having the broadest product line in the deepest technologies, we are ready and able to support that as much as possible. We will see, I mean, we are guiding here in the third quarter to a kind of similar levels in what is traditionally a softer third quarter from a seasonality perspective and our team stands ready to react whenever needed. And every day we watch the pictures coming from Ukraine and while we have a tear in one eye, we also have a pride in our belly of the part that we are doing to help those people stay free. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon, Adam. I was just hoping to circle back a little bit more on the industrial markets. I mean the macro data is looking worrisome, but I am trying to understand how much of your sales on to like factory plant floors is under pressure, maybe where there\u2019s some good signs and how long of a decline you are thinking looking at that just industrial factory sales? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Steve. Look, I think, we talked a little bit about factory automation as one area that I highlighted that we did see on a year-over-year basis, some downturn and also on the sequential basis. And I think it\u2019s been broadly reported that there\u2019s some moderation in demand around that area. How long that\u2019s going to last? It\u2019s really hard, Steve, for me to give a prognosis on. I think that we have a very strong position here. I think that the adoption of electronics in factories. The underlying trend of that, I think, is a very positive trend in the short-, medium- and in particular, the long-term. As countries and companies around the world deal with labor shortages, and I mean, gosh, you can\u2019t pick up a newspaper these days without seeing something about some either labor shortage or labor strike that is happening in the world over, there\u2019s no doubt that the adoption of electronic be it automation, robotics, next-generation factory management systems, I mean, these are really accelerating broadly. And the fact that we go through right now, let\u2019s call it, a kind of temporary pause in that for a variety of reasons, it does not take away from the very long-term prognosis for factory automation, which I think is quite a positive over the long-term. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of the AI commentary from earlier. It certainly seems to be an opportunity right in the company to real house, and obviously, great to see meaningful revenue impact already. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the competitive landscape for these high power, low latency data center applications and Amphenol\u2019s competitive positioning within that. I would assume there\u2019s not too many companies that can deliver this technology? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks so much, Chris. I mean, look, these are really hard products to make, let\u2019s start from that. To have a high speed interconnect product, be it a cable assembly, an IO connector, a backplane connector, a cable backplane system, whatever it may be, these are extraordinarily complicated products to make where the underlying technology to make them take years to develop, the manufacturing processes are extremely challenging to make these things. And so you are correct, there is a very small universe of companies and we have strong competitors, there\u2019s no doubt about it, who we respect, no question. But it is a relatively confined universe of companies who ultimately have put in the decades. And I call it really decades of investments in the engineering competency, the test and the validation of those products and all of those things, which ultimately allow one to make a reliable product that can support these next-generation complicated AI learning systems. Our position, look, we are the world leader in high speed interconnect technology. That\u2019s something that we are very proud of and that we continue to be very carefully building upon over the years and that position, I think, is a robust one for as AI investments continue. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just curious if you can give some color or kind of update on how your mix in auto regionally has shifted over time. Just given the growth that you have had over the last several years? Just commentary like you expect 3Q to be kind of similar to 2Q, but production is supposed to be down sequentially like 5%. So I am just curious if some of that is just content you are winning or some of that is regional shifts and you are participating more in faster growth markets than you used to, just any color there would be helpful? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Joe. Look, I think, if you look over a very long time period, the mix of our auto business has changed quite dramatically. I remember, gosh, when I first became CEO and that\u2019s 15 years ago, not to mention when I which was 25 years ago yesterday, our auto business was a predominantly European business. And even in my first quarter as CEO, I think, it was roughly two-thirds was European and the rest was sort of split evenly between Asia and North America and today I would tell you that the three regions are relatively balanced with maybe a touch more in Asia, followed by Europe and North America. So that has changed a lot. And I think part of that change has been really this revolution electrification where our team has done a fabulous job in taking advantage of that revolution electrification and where the largest markets for that, at least so far, have been in Asia and we have done an excellent job of positioning ourselves on a broad basis with companies who are really driving electrified and hybrid electrified vehicles. And so if I look at last quarter, we grew organically really in all three regions. I would say Europe actually grew the strongest last quarter, but we did realize growth in all three regions and I think we have a very robust position across all regions for the automotive market. And to the extent that those dynamics change, there\u2019s new companies, accelerating their performance in other regions, I am confident that our team is going to do a good job of positioning ourselves there to benefit from that. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. Will Stein : Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to ask about the broadband end market. It\u2019s been fairly well discussed among companies and in the media that there are several big projects in the U.S. like RDOF and other countries as well, to deliver broadband to more rural areas and I wonder if you can describe how that\u2019s been influencing demand in that end market and your anticipated performance over the next few quarters? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Will. Look, I think, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, while we do see a temporary pause. I mean, we have had really strong growth in broadband over the last year. I mean, last year alone, we grew by 62% in U.S. dollars and 38% organically, and yes, I mean, in the second quarter, we were flat and we guided it to be a little bit down sequentially in the third quarter. But no doubt about it, we are benefiting not just from the demand for customers around the world for higher speed connectivity to their homes and businesses, but also from the government funding that is going into this. And in particular, you mentioned RDOF, there\u2019s also BID [ph]. Both of these initiatives in North America are very significant, and by the way, long overdue from my perspective. I mean we live in a world where connectivity to the Internet becomes not just a nice thing to have, but it is really -- it is a kind of thing that you must have, it\u2019s like electricity and access to water and indoor plumbing, having the plumbing to the Internet is critical. You try to look for a job if you don\u2019t have the Internet. Try to apply for a government benefit if you don\u2019t have access to the Internet. It\u2019s essentially impossible these days. And so I think it\u2019s a really noble cause that is there to build access some of the remotest areas of our country, so that all people can have equal access to high speed, low latency Internet and all what comes along with that. And we are very happy to play our part in that, and to benefit from that over the long-term and this temporary pause that is going on right now, I think, is just that. And we look forward over -- in the coming years as that money does necessarily get spent by governments, as well as by the private sector that will be a strong participant and enabler of the broadband revolution. Operator : Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you all so much for your time today. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on this hot summer day and I hope it\u2019s not too late to wish all of you a nice summer. And I hope that you will have a little bit of chance to get some downtime as we get into the end of July and August, and we look forward to speaking to all of you in the fall in just 90 days. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you for attending today\u2019s conference and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. And welcome to the third quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today\u2019s conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol\u2019s CFO, and I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2023 conference call. Our third quarter 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends, and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the third quarter with sales of $3.199 billion in GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 and $0.78, respectively. Third quarter sales were down 3% in U.S. dollars and low-income currencies and 5% organically compared to the third quarter of 2022. Sequentially sales were up 5% in U.S. dollars, local currencies, and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.164 billion, which was flat compared to the third quarter of 2022, and up 4% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99 to 1. GAAP operating income was $658 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included $9 million of acquisition-related transaction costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $667 million. GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 20.6% and 20.8% respectively in the third quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating margin was down 10 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022 and increased by 30 basis points sequentially. On an adjusted basis, operating margin decreased by just 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022, but increased by 40 basis points sequentially. This modest year-over-year decreased and adjusted operating margin was primarily due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, which are currently operating well below the corporate average. On an organic basis, we were very pleased with our operating margin performance, which represented a smaller than typical downside conversion on the lower organic sales levels. This strong organic performance reflected the agility of our team in adjusting costs, as well as the continued benefit of pricing actions taken in the prior year. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. Our team continued to execute well on the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down third quarter results by segment relative to the third quarter of 2022, sales in the harsh environment solution segment were $887 million, an increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.9%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $1.279 billion and declined by 16% in the U.S. dollars and organically. Segment operating margin was 22.1%. Sales in the interconnect and sensor system segment were $1.033 billion and increased by 5% in U.S. dollars and 1% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.2%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.0%, which compared to 23.1% and 24.5% in the third quarter of 2022 respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was up 4% at $0.83 compared to $0.80 in the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis diluted EPS decreased 3% to $0.78 compared to $0.80 in the third quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result, especially considering the variety of challenges that the company continued to face during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $618 million or 128% of adjusted net income, and net of capital spending, our free cash flow, was $544 million or 112% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to continue to deliver such a strong cash flow yield. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, day sales outstanding, and payable days were 87, 70, and 52 days respectively, all within the normal levels. As mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 5% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.22, effective for payments beginning in January of 2024. During the quarter, the company's repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital return to shareholders during the third quarter of 2023 was approximately $275 million. Total debt on September 30th was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.6 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under existing credit facilities. Third quarter of 2023 EBITDA was $784 million, and at the end of the third quarter of 2023, our net leverage ratio was 0.8 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains extremely strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much, and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today, and I hope that you're all having an enjoyable fall so far. It's a pleasure here in Wallingford to see the beautiful orange and red hues out of our windows. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our third quarter achievements, then discuss our trends and progress across our diversified end markets, and then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. Turning to the third quarter, our results in the third quarter were better than expected. As we exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share, sales declined by 3% in U.S. dollars and local currencies, reaching just under $3.2 billion, with growth in the commercial air, military, and automotive end markets, as well as contributions from our acquisitions, which were more than offset by moderations in the mobile networks, mobile devices, IT Datacom, broadband, and industrial end markets. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, but sales did increase sequentially by 5% from second quarter levels. We're pleased that the company booked orders of $3.164 billion, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.99 to 1. I'm especially encouraged that our orders in the third quarter did exceed prior year levels, and that's an encouraging sign going forward. Profitability was very strong in the quarter. We generated adjusted operating margins of 20.8%, and that was down just 20 basis points from prior year. Sequentially our margins improved by 40 basis points, and as Craig already mentioned, these operating margins in the third quarter reflected just outstanding execution by our global management team, who continued to manage dynamically and effectively, even in the face of moderating sales. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter was $0.78, and that declined just 3% from prior year, and increased by a strong 8% on a sequential basis. Then finally, we're very pleased with the company's cash flow generation in the quarter with operating and free cash flow of $618 million and $544 million respectively in the third quarter, clear demonstrations of the high quality of Amphenol's earnings. I come out of this quarter extremely proud of the Amphenol's team, and I'll just say that our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the dynamic and challenging environment. Our acquisition team has been extremely busy this year so far, and I'm really pleased that since our last earnings call, we've closed on three acquisitions, Connor Manufacturing, Q Microwave, and XMA Corporation. In addition, we've signed an agreement to acquire PCTEL. Since its headquarters in Illinois, Connor is a global manufacturer of power interconnect products, including especially high voltage bus bars for the automotive and industrial markets with annual sales of approximately $100 million. Based in California, Q Microwave is a designer and manufacturer of mission critical radio frequency components utilized in military platforms with annual sales of approximately $20 million. And based in New Hampshire, XMA is also a provider of RF components for the military as well as the IT Datacom market with annual sales of approximately $15 million. We're very pleased that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire PCTEL. PCTEL is a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, as well as purpose-built industrial IoT products and testing measurement solutions. We expect the PCTEL transaction to close by early 2024. I'm very excited to welcome the Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA teams to Amphenol, and I certainly look forward to welcoming the PCTEL team once that deal closes. Most importantly, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into our entrepreneurial organization, this remains a core competitive advantage for Amphenol. Now, turning to our serve markets, we're very pleased that the company's end-market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced, and broad, and that creates great value for the company, particularly amidst these dynamic times. So, turning to each of our serve markets, the military market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in U.S. dollars and 22% organically, and this was really driven by broad base strength across virtually every segment of the military market. Sequentially, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these robust third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect a high-teens increase in sales from prior year. With the acquisition last quarter of both Q Microwave and XMA, we further broadened our industry leading RF product offering into this important defense market. And in general, we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position across the defense industry, where we continue to offer the market's widest range of high technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're going to continue to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity, and thus are well-positioned to support this increased demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter, had another really strong quarter with sales increasing by a very robust 40% from prior year and 37% organically. And this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by just 1%, and that was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we now expect a modest seasonal sequential decline in sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase in the mid 30% range compared to 2022. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery and travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high technology interconnect products while diversifying our market position into next generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We look forward to realizing the benefits of these initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the quarter did decline by 6% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically as growth in medical, oil and gas and rail mass transit applications was more than offset by declines in other segments of the industrial market. I did want to highlight that our sales into the distribution channel were particularly soft in the third quarter as many distributors have taken steps to reduce their inventory positions in the industrial market. Sequentially sales declined by 4% from the second quarter, which was somewhat worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate slightly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2023, we expect sales to be roughly flat versus prior year as some organic moderations are offset by the benefit of our acquisitions. Despite this near-term demand pause in the industrial market, I continue to remain so proud of our outstanding global team working in this important area. They continue to pursue growth opportunities across the many exciting segments of this truly diverse market. And I remain confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high technology interconnect, antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a very robust 13% in U.S. dollars and 12% organically. This was driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicle platforms. Sequentially, our sales increase by 7% from the second quarter, and this was much better than our expectations that we had coming into 3Q. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% compared to prior year. I'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance so far this year is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles, including electrified drivetrains, as well as a multitude of other exciting new applications. With the addition of Connor to the Amphenol family, we now have an even broader array of products for global electric vehicle manufacturers, and we look forward to benefiting from this position for many years to come. The mobile device market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and our sales moderated by 20% in U.S. dollars and 18% organically, as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declining sales of products that are incorporated into laptops, tablets, and wearables. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a much stronger than expected 25%, and that was really driven by higher than expected sales in smartphones and wearables. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high single digits sequentially. As strong growth in smartphones, we expect to be more than offset by continued declines in laptops and wearables. For the full year, we anticipate sales to decline in the mid-teens compared to 2022. While there's no question that mobile devices remains our most volatile and market, our team once again in the third quarter did an outstanding job of capitalizing on opportunities to realize incremental sales. Their agility and ability to adjust resources in real time with the changing levels of demand continues to create value for Amphenol. As we head into the end of 2023, our team stands poised as always to leverage their leading array of antennas, interconnect products, and mechanisms to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise this year and beyond. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 35% in U.S. dollars and 43% organically as we continued to manage through a broad base reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales declined by 6%, which was a bit worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline in the mid to high single digits sequentially, and for the full year, we anticipate moderation sales in the sort of mid 20% range versus 2022. Despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed investments in these next generation systems, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The IT datacom market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and while sales did decline by 12% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year, our performance in the quarter was actually much better than we'd expected 90 days ago. In fact, on a sequential basis, our sales increased by a strong 13% in the third quarter, much better than previous expectations. The growth in our sales from the second quarter was driven by an accelerating surge in demand from customers who are making significant investments in AI data centers. We also continued to see robust orders for AI related applications, a confirmation of our team's success in positioning Amphenol as a leader in the complex interconnect systems that support alternative intelligence or artificial intelligence. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we expect sales to remain at these third quarter levels, and for the full year 2023, we expect the mid-teens decline in sales compared to prior year. While we've certainly had to manage through the inventory adjustments in the broader IT market, I am more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom industry. This revolution in AI is creating a true and unique opportunity for Amphenol, given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning applications driving a more intensive usage of our highest technology interconnect products, we're very well-positioned for the future. In addition, our team just continued to do an outstanding job developing leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products that are enabling our OEM and web service provider customers to continue to drive their equipment and networks to higher levels of performance. This creates a continued long-term opportunity for the company. Finally, the broadband market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down 8% in U.S. dollars and organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down by 6% in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect the modest sequential increase in sales, and for the full year 2023, we expect sales to decline in the mid-single digits from prior year. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. In addition, we're very well-positioned to benefit from the broad array of government-funded initiatives, particularly in North America, thereby giving us confidence for the future. Now, turning to our outlook, there's no question that the current economic environment remains uncertain, and assuming market conditions do not meaningfully worsen, and also assuming constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.090 billion to $3.150 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. This would represent a sales decline of 3% to 5%, and an adjusted diluted EPS decline of 1% to 4% compared to prior year. Our fourth quarter guidance also represents an expectation for full-year sales of $12.317 billion to $12.377 billion, and full-year adjusted diluted EPS of $2.94 to $2.96. This outlook represents full-year sales and adjusted EPS declines of 2% and 1% to 2%, respectively. I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current dynamic environment, and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while also driving strong profitability. In addition, I just want to reiterate that our entire Amphenol team around the world remains committed to delivering long-term sustainable value. And I would like to finally take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our 90,000 employees around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. And with that operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : The question-and-answer period will now begin. Please limit to one question per follower. Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. I guess, Adam, maybe for you, I hope you can just talk a little bit about, what are you hearing from your customers broadly? And really on the industrial side, given the ongoing macro-voluntary, I hope you talk about the distributors side is somewhat weaker, but what are you hearing from the OEM or the trend that OEM is much different than what you're seeing in the channel? And how do you see that kind of pan out maybe into December quarter and beyond that, especially if you think about the inventory normalization? Adam Norwitt : Amit, thank you very much. Yes, I think when we look at the industrial market, I mean, the beauty of our industrial business is we have a very broad presence across, really every segment of the industrial market. And we did see some of those segments actually performing very strongly. I highlighted that we saw a very robust growth in oil and gas and rail mass transit, so strong growth in medical applications, heavy equipment, another one. But then there's other segments of the market where, which were down. And I think some of those have been pretty widely reported areas like factory automation, alternative energy, which seems to be having a little bit of a pause in the investment cycle for a variety of reasons. But by and large, our OEM business was only modestly down. And it was really the bigger impact here was the impact from the distribution channel, who it turns out, feels that they have a little bit too much inventory right now. And we started to see some signs of that maybe coming into the quarter. And I think it maybe accelerated a little bit through the quarter. And our guidance as we look out into the fourth quarter certainly incorporates a continued adjustment by our distributors in particular, as well as some on the OEM side as well. And that's what's envisioned in our sort of modest sequential moderation that is implied in our guidance. How long will that last? We certainly, 90 days from now, we'll try to give a good sense of what it looks like at least in the first quarter of next year. I would expect that it's hard to predict. But the underlying electrification and electrification of the industrial market broadly, that has not slowed down. I think, yes, there are certain things like Semicap and others where there's a bit of a digestion period right now. But we continue to see an enormous array of new innovations, new programs, new applications across the breadth of our industrial market. And I think we've built such a broad offering of interconnect products, sensors, antennas, that wherever those next revolutions are going to be in industrial, there's no doubt that Amphenol is going to be well represented there. So, I view this as a bit of a pause. I don't take an overly macro view of what's happening right now. I understand that some may look at industrial as sort of a macro proxy. And maybe there are certain areas like the German industrial market, which is really where more of the factory automation that could have a little bit more linkage between that. But the general trend of more electronics, more content being driven across all these areas of the industrial market is something that we don't see slowing down. And so, as we get into next year, we'll certainly try to give a good read on where that looks like 90 days from now. But we feel really good about our overall position in the industrial market despite this pause today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on the IT datacom market. It came in much better than what you guys were expecting three months ago. It sounds like a big part of that is the AI demand search that you referenced, Adam. So, can we maybe just talk about how the AI business is ramping? If there's anything you could provide to us around the size of the business today and any sort of outlook that we could think about into next year, because it does sound like the orders remain quite robust. And then, just kind of staying on IT datacom, any update on the broader, the non AI part of the business. Do you feel like that piece is kind of gotten through the inventory correction that's been going on since really, I guess, the back half of last year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Chris. Appreciate it. Look, I think we're really excited about where we are with our customers in AI. And I'll just put some historical perspective on this. I mean, we've been working on the innovation of products that ultimately support AI for many, many years. This is not like, all of a sudden, something like ChatGPT shows up in the newspaper and we started frantically developing products. We've been working with customers for a long time on the type of products that uniquely are required for an AI processing system. And we talked a little bit about this 90 days ago, but the nature of an AI system, the fact that it is a neural network based system, where you have these very high power chips that all have to talk to each other across a fabric like architecture, just means that there's a uniquely larger component of interconnect to allow those shifts to ultimately talk to each other. And the requirements of that, those interconnect products, both from a speed, a latency perspective, not even to mention the significant power requirements that go into these AI data centers, which consume dramatically higher levels of power, and thereby require higher technology, higher efficiency types of power interconnect to ensure that these AI data centers aren't just chewing up all the electricity in America, for example. These are really challenging and exciting opportunities where we've been investing in new product development for many, many years. It's clearly ramping. I talked about the fact that really, I would say all of our sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 came from AI. And as you recall, we had already a decent amount of AI business in the second quarter. And we don't split that out. We already talked about end markets, and we don't necessarily talk about every little sub component of that. But I would just tell you that it's a very significant opportunity for the company long-term, medium-term, and short-term as it's really driving that sequential growth that we've seen both in the second quarter and then the follow on sequential growth that we got here in the third quarter. What is the long-term of AI going to be? I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. But I think we all know that it's going to change a lot of things. And there's no doubt that the investments that are being put into these AI data centers, which are not -- these are not amounts that are for the faint of heart. They're going to really have dramatic impact on a lot of the ways that we interface and interact with and use data networks and data systems. And we're just really excited to be able to play our portion of that to enable these next generation systems. As it relates to the kind of non-AI and the inventory correction that we certainly have talked about for nearly four quarters, I would tell you that as we look into the fourth quarter, I think we feel that it's largely behind us, that inventory correction. Now, you could also say that some of the AI investments are \u201ccannibalizing\u201d some of the non-AI investments. I think there's plenty of people discussing from that vein. But I think the inventory positions have become much healthier today. And now it's all about investing in this exciting new revolution of AI and figuring out how to do that in effective fashion. And from an interconnect perspective, we're really standing right there in the front of the line, making sure that our customers have what they need. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, you've done what I would consider to be a few higher degree of difficulty deals in the past couple of years, namely a public company and MTS and heavier cost work with RFS. And now another public company in your agreement to acquire PCTEL. Just wondering how much new muscle, if you will, the organization has grown, in terms of integrating deals like this, especially public companies. And just what it might mean for the acquisition funnel going forward in terms of the prospects that you're looking at? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, Luke. Thanks. It's actually a really great question. I mean, if I go back, everybody on the phone will recall that it was the beginning of 2022 when we evolved our organization and created now three global divisions, which are reportable segments. And then under those global divisions, initially 12 and now 13 operating groups. And each of those operating groups is run by just an outstanding group general manager. I think in my career, I was a general manager, then I was a group general manager myself before I came here to headquarters nearly 17 years ago. And those group general managers run very significant businesses. They're deeply involved in the operations of the company and they're deeply involved in the identification, the assessment and ultimately the welcoming of these new companies to Amphenol. And we now have just a broader platform of extraordinarily capable individuals. I've talked many times about how I view kind of my priorities as a CEO of this company. And I view them really twofold. One is to be the protector of our culture, that unique entrepreneurial culture that I believe is really second to none in its value and its impact on our results. And the second is to ensure the scalability of that culture so that we can grow as a company really in perpetuity. And, I joined a quarter of a century ago, we were less than a billion dollars in sales, but the culture was identical. It was general managers around the world who have full authority to run their businesses and ultimately can be held accountable. Therefore, today we've gone from when I joined the company less than 20 to today around 130 of those general managers and we've scaled the organization in support of that. And that's why today we have the three global divisions and the 13 groups. And that has included as well our acquisition program. Because if you go back in time and look back, we always used to talk about M&A representing roughly a third of our growth over the long-term. And we would always get questions, well, as you grow, that means you either have to do more acquisitions or bigger acquisitions. And I think I've consistently said, well, that's right, arithmetically, and we will do and we have done both of those things, both more deals and bigger ones. And we've acquired 26 companies so far since the beginning of 2019. That has included our first ever public company that has now -- we have now announced the signing of our second public company. RFS is one that maybe requires a little more, but you go back even 10 years when we acquired the sensor company from GE, which has been a fabulously successful acquisition and will celebrate just in a couple of months here, the 10th anniversary of that acquisition. We acquired, you'll recall, FCI, which requires, a little bit more work to align FCI into the Amphenol approach of entrepreneurial general managers. So I tell you that our muscle has grown commensurate with the scale of the company and our ability to do acquisitions, large, small, private, public, whatever you may say, all of that ability has remained very strong. And then the last thing I'll say is if you look at our balance sheet, I mean, we came out of this quarter with leverage of only .8 times. We have enormous availability of capital. We have cash flow that is really at, close to historical levels. I mean, free cash flow that is 17% of our sales in the quarter. And all of the financial means of doing the acquisitions together with the organizational means are all there. But I'll say one thing, we will always stay disciplined. We are a company that is always true to our principles. We're not just going to become a little private equity company. We're not going to be a holding company. We're not going to go out and buy bad companies, run by bad people. We're always going to look for the same criteria for acquisitions that I've talked about for many years. Number one, we want great people. Number two, we want great product technology. And number three, an outstanding market position. We got all three of those with the acquisitions of Conner, Q Microwave, and XMA. And I'm sure we'll do the same with PCTEL. And we'll continue to be very disciplined as we go forward at the same time as we have a real larger aperture of capabilities to continue to do M&A at the levels that we'd like to. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. Nice to meet you and thanks for taking my question. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Nice to meet you too, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : So, yes, So, I want to start off with the automotive market, just given the size of it, you definitely some skittishness with investors heading into the quarter into year-end. On two areas, within North America, you got the worker strike, what's the ripple effect on that? And then, just weakness in China, China auto too. But you guys continue to outperform. So, I'm just -- my question is, when peaking around the corner, do you have concerns that you guys can maintain, your out-performance relative to the overall market? And can you kind of dig into some of the details around what you're hearing from customers in each of the markets? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, Andrew, thanks again and welcome to the, welcome to the call here. Not so often we get a new analyst. So, it's a pleasure to have you here. Look, the automotive market is a really exciting one for the company. I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market, results that they've driven in what has not been an easy environment, quite the contrary. Growing last quarter by 12% organically, I mean, you will recall that last year we grew by 29% organically in a market that was essentially flat to down in units. And if you look at the long-term performance of our automotive company over the nearly 15 years that I've been CEO, I still remember very well, my first quarter is CEO. And, by the way, this is my 60th of these earnings calls as CEO. In my first one of those, we had an automotive business that was 5% and our overall sales were $660 million that quarter. So, that's $33 million, $35 million, and here we are this quarter at close to $3.2 billion in our automotive market, 23% of sales. And I think we've just done a fabulous job over those years, not of taking market share out of the hands of incumbents, but of enabling new electronic systems as they were adopted in cars over that decade and a half. And I think you've just seen a collection of revolutions in the automotive industry, the most prominent and most recent of which being the electrification of vehicles. But that's not the only thing. I mean, there's so many new systems being put into these cars. And each time there's an opportunity for us to intersect those with high technology interconnect sensors and antennas. And I think our team's done a great job of that. How is that going to go into 2024? Again, I think I said this already on the call, nine days from now we'll try to give everybody a decent sense of where we think at least the beginning of 2024 is headed. But I say no reason to say that we will not continue to maintain our outperformance that we have been so consistently delivering really over a decade and a half during this time period. I'm just really proud of our team working on automotive and I'm really pleased with the broad array of technologies for all these exciting new applications in the car. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. Adam or Craig, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the puts and takes on operating margins as we look out over the next quarter. At the midpoint of the revenue guide, you would be absorbing almost $24 million of decremental margins of operating profit and you're also absorbing impact of M&A from three new deals and three prior deals. So when we look at your guide, it's clearly reflecting a much better outlook than that. So A, is the assumption around decremental margins, still the same as historical or have you made changes in the business that's creating less lower decremental margins? And B, as we think about sort of that operating guide, which is so resilient, what are some of the other drivers that are enabling you to do that? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. I think if you look at our profitability in 2023 and certainly here in the third quarter and I'll talk about the fourth quarter in a minute or two. I wouldn't say there's certainly no changes in regards to how we think about decremental margins in the long-term, but 2023, a few things have happened and certainly we've done a great job of. Number one, we're benefiting a bit from pricing and no particular order here, but we're certainly benefiting a bit from pricing that we did last year in 2022 and we did a call, we talked a bit about the work we did last year, the catch up with the inflationary environment that kind of by the third quarter into the fourth quarter of last year, the majority of the work we were pretty much back to kind of where we wanted to be and expected to be from a balance between price and cost perspective. So, we're certainly still benefiting on a year-over-year basis from that. In addition, I think we've just executed very well, certainly some of the markets that we've seen a reduction from and certainly communications markets, ID datacom being the biggest of them. We certainly have done a really great job of kind of offsetting some of those declines just from just great execution. And if you actually look at the over year-over-year margins and you take out some of the acquisitions impacts, we actually are well under those decremental margins that we typically would target. But I'd say, those are one of the two kind of bigger things that really are impacting it. I mean, 20.8% here in the third quarter is not quite a record, but certainly given the market mix in terms of the challenges that we've had from the ups and downs of a growth price perspective, not mix of margin from a market, because we don't have a significant margin range from a market, but just the mix of the growth that we've had, the ups and downs, it really has -- really been a, I think, great execution on the team's part to be able to manage that. So, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, I think our implied guidance would be that we continue to have these strong margins into the fourth quarter and that are offsetting some of the acquisitions that do clearly have lower than average margin levels and that we're working to get up to the company average over time, but no doubt we're really proud of it. I think the longer term kind of decremental margins haven't changed from this 30%, but I think this year, given a few of the factors I mentioned, I think has really benefited us and certainly we're proud of it. And these are the margins we should be at these revenue levels and we're going to continue to strive to do better. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess on a more broader level, Adam, you have a fairly diversified business and there are many puts and takes in terms of where the different markets are. Some are recovering, some are still at a lower level, but you've managed to grow orders year-over-year, as you pointed out, despite that dynamic here. I'm just wondering like how should we translate that into thinking about the order growth translating into revenue growth in the near term. More curious, because your revenue numbers for the last couple of quarters have been above the order number, but the guide seems to be more in line with what you reported for orders. So, how should we think about the opportunity to return to revenue growth since orders are already higher year-over-year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes, well, thank you very much, Samik. I mean, look, I think we just talked about the auto market and we've been consistently outperforming the overall auto, whatever you want to call it, unit volumes or whatever markets that you want to talk about. I guess when we talk about orders from year-over-year perspective, more broadly in the company, yes, we were this quarter on a year-over-year basis higher in our orders than last year, and that was the first time in four quarters. And I think that that should translate eventually to year-over-year growth. I think we've guided for next quarter in a certain way, and we're going to keep fighting for that and we'll guide for the first quarter at the same time when we come to that 90 days from now, and you can imagine that our team is very focused on returning to growth, and we don't love having it be down this quarter. We don't like having it be down next quarter, and we don't like having it be down last quarter either, and there's a whole Amphenol team around us that's fighting for that. When you look across our end markets, one of the beauties of the diversification of the company is that we have end markets which are growing substantially already, and we have others though which are down because of the various reasons that we've talked about. And so, when you think about, for example, IT datacom which was down quite significantly last quarter, I think it was something like 20%, 24% or so, and then this quarter down 12%, I think at our current guidance, that would be pretty close to prior year, plus or minus. And so that's a sign, I think, of that returning to the growth trajectory that we would for sure look forward to seeing across the company. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. I have one on mobile networks. Do you think 6G is needed for that business to reaccelerate, or can other opportunities like Open RAN, Industrial 5G, and Wireless 5 Band to be enough for the catalyst, and perhaps some combination of those along with the inventory reductions? Craig Lampo : Hey, Mark, Good to hear your voice. Look, I think 6G will come one day, but we still haven't even invested totally in 5G. So, when I think about how the mobile networks market tends to go. And I've been around long enough working in the wireless market, long enough that I've seen 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, and now 5G, and I have a decent sense of how that works. Generally what happen is there's an initial investment of that new generation. And then the operators digest and figure out the economics of it, because these are significant investments that they make. And if they can't figure out how to monetize that incremental investment, that's a challenge. I think the 5G, there's a lot of work going on to figure out how to monetize that. But I think there's a separate question. And that is, yes, this is a tough period for the wireless market. You've seen all the releases over the last several days, and the capital spending of the big operators here in the U.S, which is all down in the kind of 20% to 30% range, the equipment manufacturers in some cases down even more in this region at least, and certainly our business down on an organic basis as it was by 43%,. And I think we're in that digestion period of that new technology, but there's still a very modest proportion of the build out that has become truly 5G. And I don't know what the number is, is it 15%, is it 20%, but it's certainly not 50%, it's certainly not 60%, 70%, 80%. I mean, we're still, I believe, in the early innings of the 5G, and I think people are just taking kind of a third inning stretch on this right now to figure out how to make more money from the system. But if you think about what's going on in data more broadly, think about AI, think about video, think about all the extraordinarily bandwidth, hungry applications that continue to proliferate, accelerate, and be used everywhere you go. I mean, it's actually unbelievable when you see how data is being consumed and where it's being consumed. I watch my kids, who used to -- my son is a gamer, and he used to only game on his computer at home. Well, now he can be moving around, and he can be in the car, and he can be gaming and playing with all these strange creatures that they play with, I mean, really strange names, things like J\u00f6rmungandr [ph] and things like this, and weird things like that. And like, all these crazy, crazy things that you can do that are not connected to a cable, not connected to a desktop. And so when you think about the mobile internet and mobility of data long-term, I see no doubt that there's going to be continued acceleration and drive for next generation ways for people to do this. And when we look at our company's position here, we have a very unique position. We're one of the only companies who operate directly with the operators, as well as directly with the OEMs. And that puts us in a very unique position as they go about driving their systems to next generation capabilities. And I think the acquisition that we made of RFS earlier this year, other acquisitions that we've made put us in a really strong position. And yes, it's a tough quarter or two, and a pause of a year, but no doubt in my mind that long-term, the mobile networks market is going to be great. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. Will Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results and good outlook. Adam, I'm wondering if you can comment on the test and measurement part of PCTEL. You had this situation with a prior acquisition where there was a test and measurement equipment business bundled into it, which at the time you said did not fit in the portfolio. I wonder if it fits in this case? Adam Norwitt : Yes, well, thanks very much, and look, we're really excited about the PCTEL acquisition, and PCTEL, we've known them for many, many years as a really broad and very successful antenna company, probably a little too small to be a public company, and that's certainly one thing I would say. And yes, they have a small test and measurement business, but we're really excited about this company, and we look forward to working to bring it to its closure, and I probably wouldn't say more about it given that we've just signed the deal. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if I could get a little bit more color on the smaller M&A deals that you did during the course of the series on RF, it seems Adam, you already have such a great position in RF. I can't imagine what else you need to acquire. And then secondly, on busbars, which it seems like busbars, it's a sleepy technology that's getting more attention lately. Can you talk about why you did those deals? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes, thanks, Steve. I really appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, look, XMA and Q Microwave are fabulous companies. They're certainly at a smaller scale for now you can imagine that we have high expectations for them over the long-term. And you correctly stated, we have really the broadest position in RF interconnect technology. And these companies bring us, just as we've gone a little bit into active optics, these companies bring us a little bit extra in RF that we can offer to our customers, a little bit more conditioning capabilities in the RF interconnect products. And that's something, especially in the mil aero market that we see as being a really important part of our interconnect offering to our customers in mil aero, and I think that's really exciting. Busbars is an area that we've been in for gosh, almost the whole of my career. I remember 23 years ago or so when I was a general manager, and we were making one of our first busbars at the time, and we've been involved in busbars in the telecom industry. We've been involved in bus bars in IT. We've made great acquisitions. You'll recall the acquisition of OXCEL [ph] several years ago, which brought us more into the industrial market. And what we really like about Conner, is Conner brings us really solidly into the busbar market in the automotive market in particular around EVs. And while we have today an outstanding offering of high voltage interconnect products that are used in EVs. There's no doubt that a compliment to that is the busbar systems that are used also to move the energy around the car. And Conner just does a fabulous job there. We're just really excited to have them. And it's a continued expansion of the reach of the interconnect system, making sure that our core technologies that we have, we have them in every one of the end markets where those find favor. And I think Conner is a wonderful piece of that puzzle. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Adam, I'm hoping you can comment a little further on mobile device business. You called out relative strength in smartphones and wearables, but continued weakness on PCs and notebooks. And we're hearing from some other suppliers and part of the supply chain that things are bottoming there and some of the players in Taiwan are starting to see some signs of a recovery there. Do you have any visibility in terms of your customers as you get into next year in terms of the refresh cycle and other things? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Matt. I think you correctly stated the case here, which is, we've actually had a pretty good year in smartphones and our team's done a fabulous job there. But no doubt there's been a digestion period in the other devices in particular, the devices like tablets and laptops and the like. And I think what we've seen over this pandemic impacted kind of last four years is there was an unusual surge and a kind of disruption of the normal buying patterns of these devices, because when everybody got sent home either to work or to study or however they wanted to interact, they had to get new devices to do that. And there was just a massive surge in the consumption of those devices at the end of the day. And I think there's still a digestion from that. What is it going to be next year? I mean, look, I have a hard time guiding this market 90 days out. I'm generally wrong when I do that, and I certainly wouldn't get ahead of my speed and try to guide it for next year. But of course, at some point, that digestion of that surge of demand for those kind of devices, you would hope would normalize and I would expect that it would normalize that. I mean, I know for sure my own devices, I'm probably getting them. I run them a little longer than most, because we're pretty cost conscious here at Amphenol. But even a couple of my devices, I'm starting to think about whether I need to get a new one. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael on for Joe. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Michael. Unidentified Analyst : So recently, there's been a few like noteworthy EV and like semi-plant construction or equipment delays. So we're just curious on how like the cadence of these projects influence internal decision making or guidance, whatnot? Craig Lampo : Yes. I mean, look, we read all the same papers, and I think, individual plants may be accelerated or delayed at a given time. And I wouldn't think that, an individual announcement doesn't really have a dramatic impact on our overall business. But look, I did talk about in particular one area, which is the semiconductor capital equipment market, which I think if you asked everybody a year ago, and I\u2019d say everybody except for maybe the two of us sitting here, they would have said, oh, this will never, ever have a cycle ever again. And sure enough, here we are this year, and there is a bit of a cycle in semi-cap equipment. We have a really strong position there. We've done a great job to position ourselves long-term as really an interconnect supplier of choice to that market. And clearly, I mentioned earlier that we did see a moderation of our sales into semi-cap equipment as part of our industrial market. I don't think that's because of any individual plant. But I'd say that that is more related to I think a bit of a pause in the capital spending of some of the larger semiconductor manufacturers. EV related, I think we still see that market is pretty strong. We had a really strong performance in our automotive market last quarter. And again, 90 days from now, we'll see what that looks like next year. But I wouldn't necessarily point to any specific things related to EV factories being built or not being built. Adam Norwitt : Well, operator, I think that's our last question. And once again, on behalf of Craig and I and our whole 90,000 team around the world, we'd like to just thank everybody for your time today. We wish you all the best and wish that you and your families all stay safe. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference. And have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now introduce your conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and welcome you to our fourth quarter of 2023 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter with sales of $3,327 million and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.82. Fourth quarter sales were up 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and down 1% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Sequentially, sales were up 4% in U.S. dollars, 4% in local currencies and 2% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year of 2023, sales were $12,555,000,000 down 50 basis points in U.S. dollars, flat in local currencies and down 3% organically compared to 2022. Orders in the quarter were $3,164,000,000, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and flat sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95:1. For the full year, orders were $12,267,000,000, down 5% compared to 2022, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin was $690 million and 20.7%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2023 which increased 10 basis points compared to both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income was $706 million, which excluded $16 million in acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating margin was 21.2% during the fourth quarter and a new quarterly record for the company. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and increased by 40 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on slightly higher sales levels as well as the benefit of pricing actions. These benefits were partially offset by the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions, most of which are currently operating below the corporate average. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating income was $2.56 billion, which included $35 million of acquisition-related costs and excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $2.594 million. For the full year of 2023, GAAP operating margin was 20.4% and adjusted operating margin was a strong 20.7%, consistent with our previous annual record margins achieved in 2022 and 2018. On a GAAP basis, operating margin decreased 10 basis points compared to 2022. Compared to 2022, adjusted operating margin was flat, which primarily was driven by strong operational performance as well as the benefit of pricing actions, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was an impressive margin performance given the slight sales decline we experienced in 2023. Our team continued to execute well in the quarter, and we are proud to have sustained these healthy levels of profitability, despite the continued range of challenges around the world. Breaking down fourth quarter results by segment. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $900 million and increased by 13% in U.S. dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 26.5%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.345 billion and declined by 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% organically. Segment operating margin was 23.1%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.082 billion and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.5%. Breaking down full year results by segment relative to 2022, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $3.531 billion, an increase by 14% in U.S. dollars and 9% organically, and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $4.913 billion and declined by 13% in U.S. dollars and organically and segment operating margin was 21.6%. Sales in Interconnect and System \u2013 Sensor Systems segment were $4.111 billion, an increase by 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.3%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 19.2% and 24.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, respectively. And for the full year of 2023, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22.3% and 24.5% in 2022, respectively. In 2024, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.83 in the fourth quarter, up 1% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 5% to a record $0.82 compared to $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $3.11, a 2% increase from $3.06 in 2022. And adjusted diluted EPS was a record $3.01 in 2023, an increase from $3 in 2022. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $842 million or 162% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $739 million or 142% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver such a strong cash flow yield in the quarter and for the full year. In the full year, 2023 operating cash flow was a record $2.529 billion or 130% of adjusted net income. Net of capital spending, our free cash flow for 2023 was a record $2.160 billion or 111% of adjusted net income, a very strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 85, 70 and 55 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. And during the quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $86 bringing total repurchases during 2023 to 7.2 million shares or $585 million. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in 2023 was $1.86 billion. Total debt on December 31 was $4.3 billion, and net debt was $2.7 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.7 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Fourth quarter and full year 2023 EBITDA was $830 million and $3.1 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, our net leverage was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, Craig, thank you very much and I'd like to extend my welcome to everybody on the phone here today. And I hope it's not too late to wish all of you a happy New Year here from Wallingford, Connecticut. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and also for the full year of 2023. I'll then discuss our trends and progress across our served markets. I'll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter, and then, of course, we'll have time for questions. Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew by 3% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies, reaching $3.327 billion. On an organic basis, our sales did decline by just 1%, with growth in commercial air, defense, automotive and IT Datacom markets offset by declines across our other end markets. The company booked $3.164 billion in orders in the fourth quarter. This was a 10% growth versus prior year and flat to last quarter, but did represent a book-to-bill of 0.98:1. We're very pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 21.2% in the quarter, a clear reflection of our team's outstanding execution and these margins increased 30 basis points from prior year and 40 basis points sequentially. Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.82 in the quarter, representing a growth of 5% from prior year. I have to say that we were especially pleased that the company generated record operating and free cash flow of $842 million and $739 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter both just really clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I come out of the fourth quarter, extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst the challenging and dynamic environment. We're also pleased that we announced this morning that we closed four acquisitions in the quarter, really in November and December. Based in Ohio, TPC Wire & Cable is a value-added provider of harsh environment, cable and cable assemblies for applications across the industrial market and this includes particularly factory automation and heavy equipment and TPC has annual sales of roughly $110 million. On headquartered in New Hampshire and with annual sales of approximately $90 million, Airmar is a leading provider of sensors for the recreational marine, commercial fishing and industrial markets. LID technologies based in Toulouse France has annual sales of approximately $40 million and LID is a high-technology supplier of sensor products to the industrial and automotive markets with a focus on tire pressure monitoring and the telematics associated with that. We also closed on the previously announced acquisition of PCTEL, a leading global provider of antennas for a broad array of markets, including in particularly the Internet of Things or industrial IoT market. PCTEL generated in 2023, approximately $85 million in sales. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. In fact, our acquisition program was very successful in 2023 and our pipeline of prospective deals remain strong as we enter the new year. Indeed, we continue to see interesting near-term potential opportunities to bring outstanding and complementary organizations into the Amphenol family. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes. Now turning to the full year of 2023, despite the demand challenges that we did experience in certain end markets in the year, I have to say that the Amphenol team delivered another successful year of performance. Amidst significant organic declines in the communications end markets due to inventory builds in 2022 as well as the more recent moderations in demand in the industrial market. Our team was able to deliver overall sales that were only slightly down from prior year. This was a testament to the breadth and diversification of the company as well as our team's ability to capitalize in real time on opportunities for incremental sales across the entirety of our markets. Our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 20.7% was flat with our last year record levels in 2022 despite the organic sales decline. This excellent performance by our team allowed us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $3.01 which was just slightly above prior year levels. We also generated record operating and free cash flow of $2.529 billion and $2.160 billion, respectively, both confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Our acquisition program, which I just discussed really created a great value throughout the year with 10 new companies contributing annualized sales of more than $600 million joining Amphenol in 2023. These new acquisitions enhanced our position across a broad array of technologies while bringing outstanding and talented individuals into the Amphenol organization. We're excited that these companies represent expanded platforms for the company's future performance and have deepened our already strong bench of leaders around the world. In addition, in 2023, we bought back over 7 million shares under our share buyback program, and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, and that represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.1 billion. So while there continues to be a high level of volatility across the overall market environment in 2023, as we enter 2024, our agile entrepreneurial management team is confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior long-term performance. Now turning to the trends and our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we remain very pleased that the company's end market exposure is still highly diversified, balanced and broad with no end market representing more than 25% of our sales in 2023. This market diversity helps to insulate us from the effect of any given market volatility, while also exposing us to the exciting revolutions happening across the electronics industry. Turning first to the defense market. Our sales represented 12% of our total in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year 2023. Fourth quarter sales once again grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. On an organic basis, sales in the defense market increased by 15%, with broad-based growth across virtually all defense applications, particularly strong in naval, helicopters, communications and airframe applications. Sequentially, our sales increased by a better-than-expected 4% from the third quarter. For the full year 2023, sales in the defense market grew by 20% in U.S. dollars in local currency and by 18% organically. This reflected our operational execution, as well as broad strength across most segments of the defense market, and that particularly related to naval, aircraft engine, helicopter, communications and space-related applications. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially, and we remain very encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We are well positioned to accelerate our new product development and increase our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial air market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a very strong 25% in U.S. dollars and 23% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by broad-based strength across all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 1% from the third quarter, which was actually ahead of our expectations for a modest seasonal decline. For the full year 2023, sales increased by a very robust 36% in U.S. dollar local currency and organically, reflecting our strong design-in positions on a broad range of platforms, as well as broad-based demand across all aircraft applications. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these lofty fourth quarter levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing recovery in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of those growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter and 25% of our sales for the full year. Our sales in the fourth quarter did decline by 4% in U.S. dollars, 5% in local currencies and 12% organically as growth that we realized in oil and gas, rail mass transit and marine applications was more than offset by moderations in demand in other segments, including battery and electric heavy vehicles, building automation, transportation and heavy equipment. In addition, our sales into the industrial distribution channel continued to be more muted than they were a year ago. On a sequential basis, sales grew by 1%, but that was driven primarily by acquisitions that we did close in the quarter. For the full year 2023, sales were flat in U.S. dollars in local currency and declined by 7% organically as the contribution from acquisitions was offset by weakness in instrumentation, battery and EV, and electric heavy vehicles, factory automation and heavy equipment applications in particular. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain at these levels as the benefit of recent acquisitions offset the modest organic sequential decline. Despite this near-term demand pause driven in particular by elevated inventory levels, both in the distribution channel as well as in certain end markets, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. We are very excited by the additions of TPC, Airmar, LID and PCTEL, each of which adds complementary new interconnect sensor and antenna technologies to our industrial product offering. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial electronics market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and 23% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by a robust 16% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency, and on an organic basis, our sales to the automotive market increased by 12%. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 8%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2023, I'm pleased that our sales increased by a strong 12% in U.S. dollars, 13% in local currency and 12% organically, and that reflected broad strength across the automotive market, including, in particular, next-generation electronics, for example, electric and hybrid drivetrains. Looking into 2024, we expect a high single-digit sequential seasonal moderation in sales in the first quarter from these levels. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Their performance in 2023 is yet another confirmation of the benefits of their focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. It's really a multitude of applications, including electrified drivetrains, but not just that, many other applications. We look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter and 10% of our sales for the full year 2023. Our fourth quarter sales moderated by 3% in U.S. dollars, local currency and organic as robust growth in smartphones was once again more than offset by declining sales into tablets, laptops and wearables. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was much better than our expectation coming into the quarter for a high single-digit decline. For the full year 2023, sales in the mobile devices market declined by 12% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically as strong growth in smartphones was more than offset by declines in other mobile device applications. Looking into the first quarter, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline of approximately 35%. While mobile devices will always remain one of our most volatile of markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and 4% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market declined from prior year by 26% in U.S. dollars, 27% in local currency and 34% organically, as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 6%, which was in line with our expectations. For the full year, sales declined by 26% from prior year and 32% organically driven by the spending reductions that we've discussed throughout the year. Looking ahead, we expect a modest increase in sales from these fourth quarter levels. And despite this more challenging short-term wireless investment environment, our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts, to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. The information technology and data communications market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter and 19% of our sales for the full year. We're very pleased that our sales in the fourth quarter returned to growth compared to prior year, with sales in U.S. dollars and local currency increasing by 6% and organically by 5%. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much better-than-expected 6%. As we continue to benefit from our strong presence with AI data center customers as well as some overall improved demand. For the full year 2023, our sales in the IT Datacom market declined 13% in U.S. dollars and organically as strong demand for AI-related applications was more than offset by inventory adjustments that we saw amongst our traditional IT Datacom applications. Looking ahead, we do expect in the first quarter a mid single-digit sequential seasonal decline in sales. I have to say coming out of what was a challenging year in the overall IT Datacom market that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in this space. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling artificial intelligence. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed power and fiber optic interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we are very well positioned for the future. This creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. The broadband communications market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and 4% for the year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down 31%, in U.S. dollars and 32% organically, as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales did decline by 12%, which was worse than our expectations coming into the quarter when we anticipated more of a modest increase. For the full year 2023, sales were down by 7% in U.S. dollars and organically, driven by the continued pause in broadband operator spending. Looking ahead, we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels. Regardless of the current demand dynamics, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the broadband market. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. And finally, turning to our outlook. There's no doubt that the current economic environment remains somewhat uncertain. Assuming the continuation of these current market conditions and also assuming constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.71 to $0.73. This would represent sales growth of 2% to 4% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 3% to 6% compared to the first quarter of 2023. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world, including all of those who work across our factories, touch our products, and ultimately deliver to our customers what they need. I'm just truly grateful for all of their outstanding efforts both here in the fourth quarter, but moreover, for the entirety of 2023, without them, we wouldn't be able to make it happen like we do. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first call is to Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. One question for me would be, can you sense on the weakness on the industrial market space you talked about seeing softness there, a little bit of inventory sell, I'm curious, is that stable versus what you saw like do you feel like it's getting worse as you head into 2024? And then you can talk about it, do you see the [technical difficulty] Adam Norwitt : Yes, Amit, I didn't perfectly hear the second part of your question. There's a little bit of a connection issue. But I think relative to your question, which was, is industrial stable versus 90 days ago. I mean, look, I think we came into the quarter with an expectation of kind of a modest reduction in sales, our sales -- we're essentially in the line with that. So I think it was kind of what we expected it to be. I would say that the book-to-bill in industrial was a bit weaker. I mean, if we think about why our book-to-bill was 0.95:1. I mean, the real driver for that was industrial on 1 side. And we did see in the IT Datacom market a little bit of a softer book-to-bill. But that that is really just a little bit more of an equalization from very high books to build that we've seen over the prior couple of quarters. So I don't think the IT data come book-to-bill is at all representative of the demand environment. But I think -- in the industrial market, we did see bookings a little softer than we had anticipated. I'm going to assume that your second question is how do we see that going forward? And where do we see that kind of cycle in industrial. And I think it's early to tell. I mean the beauty of our industrial business is it so broad. And so we're not levered on to one or another of the individual segments. And you know there are so many segments across the industrial market that we participate in. And we don't have any of those that are really disproportionate to our overall business. And we continue to see some of those segments areas like marine and oil and gas, rail mass transit, medical during the course of this year. They still had very robust demand. But no doubt about it, areas like factory automation, instrumentation, those are areas where we've seen more market reductions in demand and also more impact from the distribution channel. When is that going to be worked out in the distribution channel, the inventory, when does some of that demand return in some of those segments. I think it's a little too early to tell. And as we go through the course of this year, we'll try to give you a really good read on that. I mean as we look into here now in the first quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we do anticipate in the first quarter, a kind of a modest level, but really supported by the acquisitions that we've made. And on an organic basis, we see the first quarter, again, modestly down from our current levels. Operator : Next question comes from Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. You may go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Hopefully, you can hear me clearly, and I don't have an echo, I will try. On IT Datacom market, if you guys on share some insight? Looks like this market is ramping up quite nicely for you guys. If you could elaborate a little bit on how you think about your wins in the AI segment and how you're able to ramp that into revenues going forward, especially given constraints on supply on the GPU side, how do you guys think you can ramp for AI for the remainder of the year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thank you very much, and welcome to our call. I look forward to getting to meet you in person. We're really excited about the progress that the company has made in AI. And I just want to reflect on one aspect, which is that AI is not new to us. While the world over the course of the last year has sort of woken up to AI with the advent a year ago, November of ChatGPT and the sort of revolution of generative AI. Our team has been working on the interconnect architecture surrounding AI for a long, long time. And so it is only now that maybe there is this acceleration almost, you could call it even a kind of revolution or a goldrush around AI, but we've been building the capability, building the product capability, building the manufacturing capability and capacity to support that for a long time. And I think this year, one of the ways that we were able to maybe even get a disproportionate share of some of the more urgent demand was that we were very quick to flex our capacity in favor of customers who needed products and when they needed it. And I think our team has always showed the ability to have that agility in reacting to upticks of demand. And I think that this AI is no different. I'm really proud of our team and how they've done that. Looking forward, it's still too early to say, what does that, look like over the long-term. But there's no question in my mind that AI seems like something that is not such a small deal. It seems like something where there are real economics behind it, where large companies are making significant investments into AI and where ultimately our architecture, our interconnect architecture is a very critical component together with the chips that you alluded to. Now relative to shortages of chips, that's -- I mean, we hope that there are significant investments in chip manufacturing, because in our industrial business, we do supply a lot of interconnect products that go into the industry for semiconductor manufacturing. I don't think that we've necessarily seen that as a governor on our output or on our customers' demand right now. But we'll see. It's not something that would directly impact except that maybe customers, if they couldn't get enough chips, they would moderate their overall construction. But we haven't seen that yet. And I think our team is just doing a fabulous job dealing with the surge in demand that we saw this year. And it came at a time when overall IT demand was down. But in fact, some of the products were very different products. So it wasn't just that we were able to reallocate capacity from IT products that were not being consumed as much into these. There was a lot of new stuff that we had to do. And I think we did a really great job executing on that. Operator : Our next caller comes from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, just hoping you could comment on pricing dynamics into 2024, especially in which parts of the portfolio might look at as more normal with respect to price downs this year versus areas of the business that could be a laggard in that respect? And then the related question would just be, how you're feeling about delivering productivity of your supply chain and your operations to offset any price downs you might face this year. Thanks Adam. Craig Lampo : Hi Luke, its Craig. I'll take that one for Adam. I think as we think about pricing, 2023, certainly, we talked about the fact that we didn't necessarily -- we saw pricing coming back to normal. I mean, 2022 we talked a lot about pricing adjustments we are making to try to catch-up to inflation -- inflationary increases on costs that we saw. And I think that as we came into 2023, sequentially, we did a great job on the profitability, but that wasn't necessarily the pricing dynamics. That was more really just operational execution. And I think the pricing in 2023 and as we look into 2024 is, certainly a more normalized and that the price and cost environment is more balanced. I wouldn't say that the cost environment necessarily has decrease at all. I think there is certainly an elevated level of cost, but they're just not increasing at the pace that we saw a year ago. So from that perspective, I think the pricing environment is in more of a normal situation. And as we move into 2024, I don't necessarily think we're going to get necessarily the benefit of price. And historically, that's not something that we would see anyways. And typically, if you have a normal cost environment and normal price environment, I think you'll see kind of typical kind of margins and margin increases from a profitability perspective, we talk about 25% as being a typical target that we have in a normal environment. And I think as we move into 2024, I would expect that to be the case kind of sequentially as we move into it. So really happy with where we actually ended the year here at record operating levels. So we're really well positioned, I think, as we move into 2024. I mean if you look at our -- our margin improvements, I think that that's something that I'm really proud of the team to be able to actually execute so well during the year to get to these profitability levels. So, as we move into 2024, I expect that overall environment to be the same, and I certainly expect the team to be able to execute at a similar level. Operator : Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Adam, you called out the weakness in 2023 in the communication-related markets, but you did exceed your expectations in the fourth quarter. Do you see a greater than normal organic growth rate over the next two years in these markets given the historically easier compares here? And if you could also just talk about the environment in China, that would be really helpful? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Well, you're asking me to do a tough thing, which is to talk about the next two years, in a very volatile space, which is communication. I think that's hard to say what will be the overall growth across communications. I would tell you, we see great opportunities across each of those areas with different things going on because remember, communications, not just IT datacom, it includes mobile networks. It includes mobile devices and obviously, broadband and I think there's different stuff going on in each of those areas. If you talk just about IT datacom, which is the biggest part of our communications business, I mean there is no doubt that, as I mentioned earlier, these investments in AI, I think we're in early days on this. I think that there are going to be more and more developments around the real kind of creation of new economic models around AI and then the investments to support that. That's already been broadly talked about. You've heard folks talking about pretty significant investments in these next-generation systems. And again, the interconnect products are a really integral part of those systems. So, I think on that front, I'm not getting out too ahead of my skis to say that I think at least specific to AI in IT datacom, I would expect over the coming couple of years. to see some great opportunities. I don't know about the base of IT Datacom over the next two years. I couldn't -- I can barely give you a 90-day kind of a very inaccurate guidance for mobile devices. I think that on wireless, we're going through a cycle, which is a typical cycle where they invest in a new type of a standard they wait to see and by day, I mean the service providers, the operators, they wait to see how does that settle out, how do customers take it? Are customers willing to pay more for the functionality that's delivered by that? And then there starts usually another round of the investments around that. And I think we're in that low period right now. I couldn't tell you when that low period will inflect and become more investment. But I can tell you, for sure, that in the coming years, there will need to be more investments around 5G and ultimately 6G and all the wireless networks because the vast majority of people connecting to the Internet are doing it not on a connection like a Cat 5 cable or in an office, they're doing it on a wireless basis, while they're moving around the world. And so that network is going to have to keep up with the data traffic that continues to expand kind of on an unabated basis. And then finally, broadband. Broadband is an area where I think there is a lot of push in countries like ours and others to ensure that there is both the capacity and the coverage for broadband access because it's viewed not as a luxury, but rather as a necessity that folks can have broadband access. And so I think long term, there's good opportunities there as well. Relative to China, I think I'm very happy to see that the sort of geopolitics of China and the U.S. seems to be the pendulum is swinging towards a more moderate phase. There's more people talking and all of that. And we're encouraged by that. I think the world is a better place when countries are talking rather than arguing, and I think that's a good thing. I think there's a lot written about the Chinese macro environment, and I'm not the expert to sort of go off on that. But what I will say is that in those areas of the electronics industries, where we support in China, places like the automotive industry, places like the industrial market, we continue to see great opportunities, and our team continues to do a fabulous job of capitalizing on those opportunities for the domestic market. And we feel really good about the position that we have as a company who is, of course, a global company but who operates through our unique organizational approach as a local company in that environment. And being the best of both worlds at a time like this when the world is somewhat uncertain, is a really good advantage for Amphenol. Operator : And our next caller is Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Happy New Year, and thanks for taking my question. I guess, Adam, I wanted to see if you can share your thoughts around organic growth opportunities for the company in 2024 related to inorganic growth. You have a strong pipeline of revenue from the acquisitions you've closed that you're on boarding, maybe share your thoughts about how you think about the rest of the business growing, whether they are more positive related to negatives in 2024. And what is the average sort of growth average expected of the acquisitions that you closed more recently for 2024? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thank you very much. Again, there seems to be a little bit of a cut out of the sound there. But I think your question is, how do I see the organic growth prospects as opposed to just the acquisitions. And I think we feel good about the organic prospects of the company, given all what I talked about each of our individual markets, and I'm not going to go through each of them once again. But I will just tell you that the investments that we've made in next-generation technologies, the work that we've done to support customers when they need us the most over the last two, three, four years, has positioned us very, very strongly organically to have a strong, robust performance in the years to come. And the other thing I would say as well is we think about acquisitions and obviously, in the first year that you own a company that's considered acquired growth. But we're focused much more on what happens thereafter. And are we acquiring companies that become platforms of future organic growth for the company. And I would tell you, all these 10 companies that we acquired this year, the nearly 30 companies that we've acquired since 2019. To me, these companies all represent expanded platforms for future organic growth for the company which makes me feel confident that over time, we will have subject to all of the market dynamics that, for sure, we are not immune to that the company is positioned to have really great organic growth potential. Operator : And our next caller is Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. You may go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask on IT datacom, again, with AI, the past couple of quarters, you called out sequential -- attributed sequential improvements to AI. What would you say the same thing took place in Q4? And then that plus your guidance, would you imply -- is this -- because we can't see that AI piece in that business. Would you say it's continuing to accelerate on a sequential basis? Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Andrew. Yes, I think what I said in my remarks is that we saw growth in AI, and we saw also growth in the underlying business. So I think over the last couple of quarters, I've described that are all of our upside, all of our sequential growth really did come from AI. I think that this quarter, it's some of each, which is actually really encouraging for us that we've seen maybe what 1 could call a bottoming of the underlying IT demand. Are we continuing to make progress in AI? Do we see continued acceleration opportunities? Yes, I wouldn't say that every quarter, it's going to accelerate in lockstep like it did over the course of Q2 and Q3 but for sure, we see opportunities long-term to be generating sales related to AI that are greater than we are today. Operator : And our next caller is Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my question and Happy New Year to all of you as well. Automotive has been a fast-growing market for the company. However, several auto OEMs have been seen EV sales and they said they're going to rethink how fast they want to shift their production towards EVs. And so I'm hoping to better understand if you think that will create any meaningful near to intermediate-term challenges for Amphenol that could limit the company's growth of market or perhaps lead to some inventory destocking? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Mark, and Happy New Year to you as well. Look, we read all the same papers, and we hear about the sort of discussions about slowdowns in EV sales. And I think we shouldn't forget that this is a fairly western dynamic. I don't think we hear, for example, in Asia and specifically in the largest car market in the world, China, about folks turning their back on EVs and going back to internal combustion engine. But we do hear a little bit about that, I think, here and in Europe. And as I've described, I mean, we don't care if a car has an EV drivetrain or not. What we care about, does a car have a lot of electronics in it and new electronic systems. Among those systems are certainly electrified drivetrains or hybrid electric drivetrains. And I think that what we've seen in Asia, what we've seen in Europe, what we've seen in North America is that there is a real acceleration of the adoption of electronics in cars period. And some of that may actually be related to the fact that EVs tend to be a little more fancy electronically. And I think car companies are seeing that and upgrading their standard companies to incorporate more electronic functionality. And whenever you have electronic functionality in a car, regardless of the drivetrain, you're going to have new interconnect solutions. You're going to have new sensor solutions. You're going to have new antenna solutions. And those are the three areas of our participation in the automotive market. For sure, if I go to like the largest EV market, China, for example, I mean, there continues to be unabated a real adoption. And I would almost say that EVs in that market have kind of reached a sort of escape velocity, where they're just really normal. I mean you see them all over the place. And I think our team there just did a fabulous job of getting a breadth of penetration across both domestic and international EV manufacturers, whereby we really are able to enjoy the benefits of that. And I think in Europe and in North America, we've done a great job, but we've also done a really great job on capitalizing upon some of these new electronics. And so, I wouldn't put any dynamic here in the category of something that we view as a real near or medium-term challenge. I think quite the contrary, as car companies struggle to figure out how they can sell their products and make more money from doing it, they're always going to fall back on electronics as the way to do that. And that's a good thing for Amphenol. Operator : Our next caller is William Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. William Stein : Great. Thanks. Adam, I'm hoping you can comment on the aperture for M&A and products within it. I think historically, you've talked about not wanting to acquire system-level solutions. And I think at least one of the acquisitions you've done recently has such products. And I wonder if that could potentially be something you'll grow into and expand or if we should see you perhaps shy way of that business going forward? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much. I think what you're alluding to is PCTEL and the fact that they have a very small test and measurement business and really wonderful people, wonderful products, but that's not why we bought PCTEL. And just -- you'll recall, we've acquired companies in the past, some of which are not purely the things that we were looking to acquire. And we're always very sensitive that we're never going to put ourselves in a competitive situation with our customers. And really PCTEL is known for their antenna technologies, which are fabulous. Not to say a bad word about their team that works in test and measurement, but we're not adopting a strategy to go after system-level products. In terms of our aperture for M&A, I mean we just see fabulous opportunities. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. I think we have demonstrated an ability to acquire companies really across the board from a size perspective. We've demonstrated the ability to acquire a lot of companies and to process those effectively. And our small little headquarters team here, they may have been a little bit busier than normal over the last year with these 10 acquisitions. But the beauty is because of our organizational structure now having 14 groups across three global divisions, we have the wherewithal to make sure that those acquisitions get really their due attention when they become part of Amphenol. And I think the near-term pipeline remains a very robust pipeline, and we look forward to taking advantage of that. We will always remain a very disciplined buyer as we have forever. I am willing to walk away at the very last moment, if I have to, if something we find is not to our liking. We'll always pay a reasonable price, a fair price for great companies. We may not always be the highest priced buyer, but I think we are often the best buyer because of our effectiveness, our willingness to work aggressively to get things done. And the fact is our organizational structure allows those newly acquired companies to become part of Amphenol in a very unobtrusive fashion. They joined seamlessly. They come in and on day one. They just keep operating like they were doing on all the days before. And that is a relatively low-risk approach to acquisition, because we're not going in and just over -- just sort of having these kind of convulsive restructurings of the company, where you run the risk of destroying what you didn't even know you had. So we look forward to continuing to have great acquisitions in the future, but we're not going to be a kind of a system-level company. We know what we are. We're an interconnect company. There are wonderful opportunities for interconnect products to be expanded, both organically and through acquisition going forward, lots of really attractive companies out there, and we'll continue to position ourselves so the ones that match with us, the ones that go through our really rigorous kind of Rubicon of deciding whether or not to buy them, we'll be in a good position to execute on those over the near, medium and long term. Operator : And our next call is Chris Snyder with UBS. You may go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on some of the earlier conversation on AI. So it sounds like book-to-bill for AI moderated sequentially, maybe after some early outsized orders just given the company's foundation in that market. So I guess the question is, do you think that this moderation is a single quarter phenomenon? Or would you expect that to persist for multiple quarters? Because it does seem like the top line is still continuing to grow sequentially? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thanks very much, Chris. Yes. I mean, look, I don't usually talk about book-to-bill by submarkets. But I will tell you that, for sure, I mean, we had very strong bookings in AI-related applications in Q2 and Q3. And so it's not surprising that here in Q4, our IT Datacom book-to-bill was a bit below zero and -- sorry, a bit below one and because of those significant orders that we received, which customers wanted to place because they need the product and then we're executing upon those orders. And yes, I think that our IT Datacom business is in a good position looking forward. I mean our guidance for the first quarter is to have a little moderation, which is not abnormal this time of year, actually quite normal. Let me say that. And layered on top of that, I think the AI is a good thing to have. So no, I think you characterized it quite well. Operator : Our next call is Joseph Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Michael on for Joe. So earlier, you had mentioned commentary regarding orders and specific markets. Can you just provide like a high level, maybe book-to-bill on a consolidated basis for the quarter? Or any color there? Craig Lampo : About earlier that our book-to-bill was 0.95:1 for the quarter. Operator do we have another question. Operator : Our next caller is Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. I guess broadly speaking, the latest round of acquisitions were around sensors, antennas and assemblies I was just curious, like, Adam, your updated thoughts on your M&A focus by technology, especially in the context of what looks like gross margins that are now at the 33% level. I guess some of these products have lower gross margins, some have higher. I don't know if there's a mix impact that's influencing the gross margin now with the M&A. But just broadly speaking, when you -- the general buckets of technology that you look at, what is your thinking of what you've done and where you need to go now? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Steve. Yes. I mean, look, in the quarter, we acquired companies who make sensors, antennas, cable and cable assemblies and really high-technology cable actually that has really great value for its customers. And we continue to see acquisition opportunities across really all of our interconnect products from discrete connectors to cable assembly, value-add, complex value-add interconnect products sensors, complex sensor interconnect assemblies, antennas and the like. And we're really pleased to continue to find companies across all of those products. I wouldn't tell you that we think so much about gross margin by product. We see great margin opportunities as you know. And Craig has said it so many times, we're very much focused on operating margins. And yes, I mean, some of these companies do operate below our corporate average, not all of them, by the way, but some of them do. And I think we -- that doesn't relate at all to their product type. We don't believe that there is a correlation between whether someone makes a connector, a sensor and antenna a cable or a cable assembly that, that is necessarily going to put them in a certain bucket of profit potential. We actually see great profit potential for all companies. And that's one of the ways we screen for acquisitions. I mean we're not going to buy a company if we don't see the long-term potential for that company to elevate its profitability to at or above our corporate average. Now, we do have industry-leading margins and so most of the companies that we do acquire tend to be lower than we are. And then it's our job and their job becoming part of the Amphenol family to bring those margins up over time. But it's really not at all correlated to the type of products that they sell. Operator : And our last question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. You may go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Adam, in your commentary on mobile devices, you mentioned that tablets and notebook PCs continue to be weak. But we are hearing some chatter about expectations for a potential refresh PC refresh cycle playing out in the next year or two. So wondering if you have any visibility into that? And can you give us a sense of the content opportunity for Amphenol within notebooks, particularly in the next-generation so-called AI-enabled PCs? Adam Norwitt : Great. Thanks so much, Matt. Look, I hope what you say is the case. We certainly hope that there is a refresh. Look, I think we've talked about this year and even a little bit last year, that the strength that we've seen in phones this year, which was more than offset, in particular, by things like laptops and tablets. It had to do with the clear fact that during the pandemic and when everybody went to work from home and study from home, there was an enormous rush to buy new devices, which caused a surge and really kind of upset the normal replacement cycle of those products. And so I guess that one could expect that if everybody bought a bunch of stuff in 2020 and 2021 and if those things tend to last three, four, five years, that eventually you would hope to see a little bit of a refresh. I don't know -- I can't tell you I have any information to support that. I'm sure you're getting your information from even wiser sources than I would have. Relative to the content, we do see great content opportunities in these devices as they get more complex, as they get more different wireless standards that they have to support as they have higher speeds, as they have more fine pitch and more precision inside of them, all of these create opportunities for Amphenol long term. We've always said about the mobile device market, and that includes tablets and laptops and the like, that to the extent that there is a premium on the hardware of the product, that can create opportunities for Amphenol over the long-term. And I think that will. Whether that's related to AI or not, that I can't necessarily connect those dots, but for sure, people are going to need new devices in the future, and we'll be happy to enable the interconnect products across those devices. Well, operator, if that was our last question, I guess I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody here today for spending a little bit of your time with us. I wish that you all have a good continuation of your winter wherever you may be. And we look forward to talking to all of you just 90 days from now. Thanks so much. Craig Lampo : Thanks, everybody. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",

At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo, and you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our first quarter 2024 conference call. Our first quarter 2024 results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make some forward-looking statements. So please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the first quarter with sales of $3.256 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.80. First quarter sales were up 9% in U.S. dollars, 10% in local currencies and 6% organically compared to the first quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were down 2% in U.S. dollars, 2% in local currencies and 4% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were $3.348 billion, up 16% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and 66% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.03:1. GAAP and adjusted operating income was $685 million, and operating margin was 21% in the first quarter of 2024. On a GAAP basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of '23 and 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and decreased by 20 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the modest decrease in adjusted operating margin reflected better-than-typical conversion on the lower sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance, which reflects the continued strong execution of our teams. Breaking down the first quarter results by segment relative to the first quarter of 2023, sales in Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $916 million and increased by 7% in U.S. dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 26.7%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.266 billion and increased by 12% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically. Segment operating margin was 22.6%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.075 billion increased by 8% in U.S. dollars and 2% organically, and segment operating margin was 18.2%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.7%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.9% and 24% in the first quarter of 2023, respectively. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.87 in the first quarter of '24, up 23% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 16% to $0.80 compared to $0.69 in the first quarter of '23. This was an excellent result. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $599 million or 120% of adjusted net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $506 million or 101% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong free cash flow yield in the quarter. I would note here that we may see slightly elevated levels of CapEx in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support some of the growth that we are seeing in certain markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 89, 70 and 53 days, respectively, all within the normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $108. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the first quarter of '24 was $286 million. During the month of April, the company repurchased the remaining authorized amount of stock under its existing $2 billion stock repurchase plan, thus completing the plan. And as noted in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year open-market stock repurchase plan. Total debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion and net debt was $2.3 billion. Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $5.7 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $2 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. First quarter 2024 EBITDA was $810 million. And at the end of the first quarter of 2024, our net leverage was 0.7x. Following the close of the quarter in April, the company used $350 million in cash on hand to repay its maturing 3.2% U.S. senior notes and our $750 million undrawn term loan matured and was not renewed. In addition in early April, we completed a $1.5 billion U.S. bond offering, and the company intends to use the net proceeds from the bond offering, together with cash on hand and other debt financing to fund the company's pending acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, which we continue to expect to close by the end of the second quarter of 2024. As a result of the U.S. bond offering, we do expect quarterly interest expense to increase to approximately $55 million, although until CIT is closed, we also expect interest income generated from the increased cash balance to offset the increase in interest expense. As such, the impact on earnings will be relatively usual until the CIT closing occurs. The company is in a very strong financial position, and we are well positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on market trends. R. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my warmest welcome to all of you here from beautiful Wallingford, Connecticut, where spring is certainly in the air. As you know as is typical, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the first quarter. I'll then discuss our trends and our progress across our diversified markets. Finally, I'll comment on the outlook for the second quarter. And of course, we'll have time for questions. Our results in the first quarter were stronger than expected, exceeding the high end of guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We're very pleased that our sales grew from prior year by 9% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies, reaching $3.256 billion. On an organic basis, our sales increased by 6% with growth in IT datacom, commercial air, automotive, defense and mobile devices markets, somewhat offset by declines in the mobile networks, broadband and industrial markets. And I'll talk about each of those markets here in a few moments. We're very pleased that the company booked $3.348 billion in orders in the first quarter and that, that represented a positive book-to-bill of 1.03:1. Our profitability was very strong in the quarter, and adjusted operating margins reached 21% even in the quarter, a robust 90 basis point increase from last year's levels. And from that profitability, we generated adjusted diluted EPS, which grew 16% from prior year to $0.80. Finally, we generated strong operating and free cash flow of $599 million and $506 million, another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. As Craig mentioned, we're very pleased that the Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion 3-year stock repurchase program, and this represents another important component of the company's balanced capital deployment. I'm extremely proud of our global team of Amphenolians. The company's results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization who continued to perform very well in the most dynamic of environment. Now as we announced on January 30, just after our Q4 earnings, we're very pleased to have signed an agreement to acquire Carlisle's Interconnect Technologies business for $2 billion in cash. CIT as it is known, is a leading global supplier of harsh environment interconnect solutions primarily to the commercial air, defense and industrial end markets, with approximately 6,000 employees worldwide. The company's wide range of products, including wire and cable, cable assemblies, contacts, connectors and sensors are highly complementary to Amphenol's existing interconnect and sensor solutions. As previously announced, CIT is expected to have annual sales of approximately $900 million in 2024 with an EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. We do continue to anticipate that the transaction will be completed by the end of this second quarter. Accordingly and based on CIT's current operating performance, we do expect this acquisition to add roughly $0.02 to earnings in the second half of 2024, excluding acquisition-related costs. As we look forward to welcoming the outstanding CIT team to Amphenol, I remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions really of all sizes, and to successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol remains a core competitive advantage for the company. As our organization has evolved and scaled, so too has our ability to effectively manage a greater number of acquisitions of all sizes. Now turning to our progress across our served markets. I would just comment that we continue to be pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application. So starting out with the defense market. This important market represents 11% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew from prior year by a strong 13% in U.S. dollars and 11% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales were down by 2%, and this was modestly better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales to increase modestly from these first quarter levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. We're well positioned to accelerate our new product development while also increasing our capacity to support this demand long into the future. The commercial aerospace market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by a strong 20%, both in U.S. dollars and organically and that was really driven by broad-based strength across virtually all aircraft applications. Sequentially, our sales grew much better than expected, 11% from the fourth quarter. As we look into the second quarter, we do expect a modest reduction in sales versus these very strong first quarter levels. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus demand for jetliners, our efforts to strengthen our breadth of high-technology interconnect products, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends for the company. We continue to see great, long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market, including with the CIT acquisition, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in this market did decline by 1% in U.S. dollars and 10% organically. During the quarter, we did see some growth in marine, public safety, rail mass transit and oil and gas applications but that was more than offset by moderating performance, particularly in battery and electric heavy vehicles, instrumentation and factory automation. On a sequential basis, we were pleased that sales were up 6% from the fourth quarter, a bit better than our expectations, but that growth was really driven by our acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter. Looking into the second quarter. We expect sales in the industrial market to remain at similar levels as here in the first quarter. And despite this near-term positive demand, I remain proud of our outstanding global team working in the industrial market. And I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. The automotive market represented 24% of our sales in the first quarter. And sales in the first quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically. That was really driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications, including especially communications-related applications as well as electric and hybrid, electric vehicle drivetrains. Sequentially, our sales declined by 3% from the fourth quarter, which was better than our expectations, and that reflected strong execution by our team working in the automotive market. As we head into the second quarter, we do expect a modest sequential decline in sales. But I'm just so proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued and clear outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And while that includes electrified drivetrains, it also includes a multitude of other exciting applications. And we look forward to benefiting from that strong position for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter. Our sales were flat from prior year in U.S. dollars but grew 2% organically as growth in laptops and smartphones was offset by declines in tablets, wearables and other products. Sequentially, our sales declined by a better-than-expected 29% compared to the fourth quarter. As we head into the second quarter, we now expect a mid-single-digit sales decline from these first quarter levels as customers prepare for new model launches in the second half of 2024. While mobile devices will no doubt always remain one of our most volatile markets, our outstanding and agile team is poised as always to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, which positions us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales did decline from prior year by 13% in U.S. dollars and 25% organically as we continue to manage through a broad-based reduction in spending by network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially though, we were pleased to see that our sales did grow by 5% from the fourth quarter, as we had expected, coming into Q1. And as we look into the second quarter, we now expect a high single-digit increase in sales, which does reflect some increased demand that we are seeing from our mobile operator customers. While no doubt the short-term investment environment in the mobile networks market has been challenging, I can just tell you that our team continues to work aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. When customers once again drive renewed wireless investments, we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. We're poised to build on that position as wireless technology continues to accelerate long into the future. The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the first quarter grew by a very strong 29% in U.S. dollars and 28% organically, and this was driven by accelerating demand for our products used in artificial intelligence data centers. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 1% from the fourth quarter, which was substantially better than our expectation for a mid-single-digit decline. We continue to experience strong orders for AI-related interconnect products. And accordingly, as we look into the second quarter, we expect sales to grow in the low double-digit range from these first quarter levels. I can tell you that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do a really outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, this revolution in AI that we're all living through right now has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether it's high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and that just creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for the company. The broadband market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter. Sales declined by 19% in U.S. dollars and organically from prior year as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat, which was slightly worse than our expectations coming into the quarter. And as we look into the second quarter, we anticipate sales to remain roughly at these first quarter levels. Yes, regardless of the current demand dynamics in broadband, we do remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position. We look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, all of whom are working to increase their network coverage and bandwidth to support the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now turning to our outlook and of course, assuming current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the second quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.240 billion to $3.300 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. This would represent sales growth of 6% to 8% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 13% compared to the second quarter of last year. I just wanted to note that as is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed, including CIT. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I'd just like to take, again, this opportunity to thank the entire global team of Amphenolians around the world, nearly 100,000 of them worldwide for their truly outstanding efforts here in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be very happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, Adam, AI, you talked a little bit about AI as well, but it's mainly a big focus for everyone, including investors. So I'm hoping you could maybe, perhaps, help us understand what solutions, what products does Amphenol really sell to the customer base right now when it comes to AI infrastructure? And how does that really differ from what you sell to processor companies versus the cloud providers that are running their own infrastructure? I'd love to just understand that. And if there's any way to put dimensions around how big this business can get for you folks over time would be really helpful. R. Norwitt: Well, thanks very much, Amit, and really appreciate the question. Look, we're really excited about the renewed and really revolutionary investments that are being made in AI right now. I mean I have to confess that I am a consumer of these products. I've been using them. It's amazing. Last night, my wife made me tacos because, of course, it's Tuesday, and she went on ChatGPT. And she said, \"Give me a great taco recipe.\" And it's just unbelievable what you can do for these things.  And the underlying magic of these systems is just extraordinary computations, creating essentially probability models that are based on comparing everything to everything else. And to do that, you need the chips, whether they'd be GPUs or TPUs or sensor or whatever the chips that there are. They need to be connected to each other in essentially a fabric network. And these calculations and computations and comparisons have to happen virtually at light speed. And thus, that requires an enormous degree of high-speed, low latency interconnect products that are different in their architecture. You have much more use, for example, of cable assemblies than you did in the past using maybe printed circuit boards. You have really direct connecting as close as possible to the chip of those high-speed products. And these are extraordinarily challenging products to build. These are products that we've been working on for so many years. I mean, more than a decade of effort in developing these products. And they're just extremely challenging, extremely high technology and extremely critical to the good performance of those products. But it doesn't just start and end with high speed. I think it's been broadly discussed lately, power and what does power mean for AI? And is there even enough power in the world to energize these AI data centers that people are talking about. And so you can imagine that there's an enormous focus as well on the efficiency of the power interconnect in these systems. And that's another area where Amphenol is participating with some of our leading-edge power interconnect whether that's connectors, cable assemblies, bus bars and all the like. And then there's, obviously, fiber optics and the fact of using optical interfaces, whether those are active or passive fiber optic products. Those are all things that we can offer to our customers. And we have the broadest deepest highest technology offering into the data center market. We've been working and preparing for kind of this moment for so many years as we've been developing the sort of type of interconnect architecture that needs to be used. And fortunately, over the last kind of 5 quarters or so, that's really taken hold. And I think it's -- this AI seems to really have a lot of value for the end users, it seems to draw an enormous amount of investment in capital, maybe, by the way, even a little bit of cannibalizing of capital from more traditional data centers. And it's not just about having the right products. But it's also about being able to ramp up those products and being able to react quickly to our customers who are really having, in many ways, kind of an arms race. And when I talked about the IT datacom market, I mentioned all of our growth. And in fact, a little bit more than all of our growth this quarter, which was very substantial growth. 28% organically came from products that are being integrated into AI data centers. And it's something that as we look into next quarter, where we still have a favorable view of that, I think our team is realizing the benefits of really a lot of labors for many years in the past. Operator : Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Just hoping you could help us unpack a little bit more the uptick in orders and book-to-bill being positive this quarter. Just particular areas of strength that are driving that and maybe areas that are still lagging at this point? R. Norwitt: Well, thanks so much, Luke. First of all, we're really pleased to see the positive book-to-bill, 1.03. I mean, I know during COVID, there were some funny books to bill at a few points where it was like 1.15:1 and then there were some negative book-to-bill. I mean, traditionally, 1.03 is actually a very strong book-to-bill for us because our lead times are not that long. We're a very reactive company, and I think that's a really good sign.  It shouldn't be surprising that maybe the 2 places where we saw slightly negative book-to-bill would have been in mobile networks and industrial. Otherwise, we saw either flat or positive book-to-bill and probably our strongest bookings on a book-to-bill came out of IT datacom as well as Commercial Air, which were really good books to bill. Operator : Our next question is from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : I wanted to dig in more on the Carlisle, CIT, acquisition. It's relatively large. It was held by a commercial roofing company before. So what's the opportunity here being under your ownership? And where do you see potential to improve margins? R. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much, Saree. I mean first, I just want to complement Carlisle, the corporation. I work closely with the CEO of Carlisle, who's a wonderful guy. It's a fabulous company actually. And it's true, their focus and their stated strategic focus is to be in the building materials industry. And they were a wonderful steward of Carlisle Interconnect for many years. But there's no doubt that interconnect was not where they were focused strategically. And I'm really pleased and happy for the team, the corporate team at Carlisle because I think they've really been able to realize their vision to be a focused building materials company. At the same time, Carlisle Interconnect is a fabulous company. I've known this company for most of my quarter century in Amphenol. It's one of those companies that we actually don't compete with them very much. Very little, actually. It's such a complementary company, but I've always admired the company. And we've always admired the company for their great technology fabulous people. And I've known some of the people at CIT also for many, many years. And I just can't tell you how happy I am that they're going to be on our side of the table, but they're going to join the Amphenol family. And that's really just -- it's such a fabulous organization inside of CIT. I mean what we really love about this company, they are a true leader in the technologies around wire and cable; in cable assemblies; in contact technologies, which is just so complementary to our leadership position on connectors and other value-add interconnect on things like back shells and the like. And when we bring that together, that offering to customers, whether that's in the commercial air market, whether that's in the defense market, whether that's in certain segments of the industrial market where they participate. We will be able to bring a total solution to those customers at a time when those customers really want to have reliable partners. I mean you think about some of the dynamics that are evident, for example, in Commercial Air, the reliability of your partners is an enormous premium in these things. I mean you're making critical devices, airplanes that hundreds of passengers go on and being able to go to one company and say, can you bring us a total set of solutions for our interconnect needs, that has a really, really wonderful and comforting dynamic for the customers. In terms of the profitability. CIT is a great company. It is operated in a bit of a holding company structure. I can tell you that we, in Amphenol, have a lot of different sister companies, brother companies around the world who have figured out lots of tricks of the trade of accessing low-cost manufacturing, of helping to reduce the supply chain and all of that. And while the CIT team, they're going to still run this company. It's not like we're going to parachute a bunch of folks into CIT and say, \"Go run it on their behalf.\"  It's the quite the contrary. I mean, the existing management team is going to stay running that company as part of Amphenol, but they will be able to avail themselves of experience of collaborative interactions with folks around Amphenol that in our experience, ultimately leads to better performance. We've had a good track record and some may call it a great track record of buying companies that were great companies with great technology, great people, that just were maybe part of the wrong parent company. All the way back to early 19 years ago when we acquired Teradyne Connection Systems from Teradyne Corporation. Again, Teradyne is an outstanding company, in the test and measurement industry, but they were not an interconnect company. When we acquired the Advanced Sensors business from GE, and again, GE is an outstanding company. And just as you know, they focus now, and it's now GE Aerospace. It's a wonderful company but they were not an interconnect company. And here again, with MTS, the company that we acquired in 2021. Another example of a great company that ultimately was not an interconnect or in that case, a sensor company. I think as part of now an interconnect company where they really belong. I have really high hopes long term for the progress that the CIT team will make. This will not come overnight. There's no doubt about it. That takes time. And we're patient in that respect, but we're very hopeful and we have really a strong vision for the future of this company as part of the Amphenol family. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Adam, maybe back to this AI topic a little bit. Thanks for all the color you shared. Clearly, Amphenol has been in this space for a long time, and you continue to push the envelope both in terms of data speeds and signal integrity issues. So can you just talk about how you're seeing pricing evolves, maybe generation to generation? What's been the history there? How are you anticipating that given the higher value and kind of much more sort of transmitting 800 gigs instead of 400 gig speeds. So clearly, there's value in there, but the density of applications is becoming more complicated and the unit volumes are also growing kind of order of magnitude, higher. So putting all those together, how should we think about just the opportunity here? Is it right to think about maybe you're guiding to like a 30% growth in this end market right here in the next quarter. Is that something that's possible to continue into 2025? R. Norwitt: Well, thanks, Wamsi. A lot wrapped up in that question. I mean, look, I guess to the very end of your question, I'm not going to get out ahead of myself and try to give a guidance about this revolutionary thing into 2025. As you know, we give guidance for the quarter ahead of us, and then we try to make sure we're maximizing our position of whatever the market will bring us long term. .  But I would say this, number one, you mentioned pricing. I mean we are always trying to deliver to our customers' value and so our goal is to deliver the maximum amount of value to our customers at the lowest price that they can get. And if we can deliver enough value to our customers, then there will be some of that value left over for us. And I think what you see in AI is the criticality of the interconnect in these systems. I mean there is a direct correlation between the power of these AI learning and inference models and the quality and performance and capability of the interconnect systems because, again, you're talking about speed and latency. And so when you think about how long does it take to build a model, well, if you have even the tiniest proportion of higher latency between the chips, then all of a sudden, what may take a month, takes 3 months to build these complex models that are using trillions of learning factors across them. And if you take 3 months and your competitor takes 1 month, and your model is more up-to-date than your competitors, all of a sudden, you as a service provider, are not able to monetize these massive investments that you're making. So if you think about that correlation between the speed and the latency and then, in fact, the economics of the models, you can understand that there is a lot of value embedded in our products as it relates to what it creates in terms of functionality for our customers. And whether that's at the chip processor level, whether that's inside the data centers, with the cloud operators, whatever that is. There's no doubt about it that we have to build also our capacity and that these are extremely high-precision products. They require intensity of testing. They require intensity of automation. Craig, I think, alluded to in his prepared remarks a little bit that we might see a couple of quarters of a little bit more CapEx, not just for this market, but for other markets as well. But this is one of those areas where we're really building up phenomenal capabilities. And I just have to take one last moment here and answer your question. Like everything that I'm talking about, it's easy for me to say all these things. I can't tell you how hard our team is working to execute on these words. I mean again, these are complex products with complex production processes, complex systems, extremely high reliability, a lot at stake because of those underlying economics. And boy, I have rarely been as grateful as I am to those folks who are working 24/7 across Amphenol around the world to really ramp up in support of our customers that are implementing these AI data centers. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : I'm hoping to better understand how Amphenol is thinking about capital allocation for the rest of the year, especially with the pending Carlisle Interconnect transaction. Is the M&A funnel still active? And with the new repurchase authorization you announced this morning, but also the potential cash usage for M&A., so just Carlisle, how active might the company be on buybacks this year? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Mark. Yes, I think in regards to our capital deployment, we've had a very consistent policy and practice over many years with regard to our capital deployment and over a whole host of years where we've done a significant amount of M&A and less M&A, and we continue to be kind of -- it continues to be a balanced and flexible deployment strategy. In the current year with the CIT, I talked about how strong our balance sheet is, the 0.7x net leverage, the strong free cash flow that we generate and continue to generate. And so I wouldn't think even with CIT, I wouldn't say that, that would have any impact ultimately on our capital deployment strategy. And we did just renew or have a new $2 billion 3-year share repurchase program. Certainly, that's one of the legs and a return of capital to shareholders. We, ultimately over time, we want to return about 50% or roughly half of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And part of that is our dividend yield, which is roughly 1%, and we continue to target that over time as well as our share repurchase plan. So I would say this new plan is just consistent with that and our dividend -- certainly policy is consistent with that. And ultimately, that M&A continues to be the focus that ultimately over time, we believe that, that will continue to drive strong returns. So if there was a time where we generated a significant closing of deals in this particular year, what we think about maybe dialing back share repurchases. But at the end of the day, just considering the significant free cash flow that we generate, we really haven't had to do that and certainly wouldn't expect this year just with CIT to have any adjustment to that. R. Norwitt: And Mark, relative to the M&A pipeline. I would just tell you that our pipeline remains strong. Yes, we completed last year, 10 acquisitions. Yes, we announced in January, our largest ever acquisition was CIT. But I can tell you, we have the appetite, the capacity and the ability and agility to continue to make acquisitions, large and small. And I think we continue to demonstrate our ability to do more acquisitions, do bigger acquisitions. And the beauty of this industry and the beauty of this market is that there's just so many great opportunities to find companies with great people and great technology and a very complementary market position to Amphenol. We remain extremely disciplined in our acquisition program, and we will walk away for -- if we get a bad feeling up until the last second, before we wire money. But there's no doubt about it that there's great, great opportunities for us for the future. And as Craig mentioned, like our financial condition is in really a fantastic position with 0.7x leverage here at the end of the quarter. Our leverage will just be a touch above 1, following the acquisition of CIT. And so we have really the capacity, the capability and the appetite to continue. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : I was just wondering on the auto markets, the 17% growth you talked about. I know you highlighted communications. And I know you guys don't like to count cars per se, but can you just sort of provide some color on the backdrop you're settling into right now and into Q2? And what exactly would you call out as sort of leading products that you're especially doing well on right now? R. Norwitt: Yes. Thanks very much, Steve. And you're right, I don't like counting cars necessarily. I mean, the market is what the market is. But look, we have taken advantage, I think, for a very long time, not of an overall growing auto market. I mean, if you look over, I don't know, 8 years or something, it's still sort of a similar level of total worldwide auto production. But there's no doubt that the content has expanded dramatically over these years.  And I think we've taken a real advantage of that. So when we think about our opportunities, we talked a lot over the past years about electrified drivetrains, the high-voltage connectors, for example, sensors that go into that. But we've also talked about all the other applications. And so when you think about communications, as I highlighted earlier, there's just more and more communications technology being put into cars. And as a leader in RF technology for cars, as a leader in antennas for cars, as someone who participates really across that whole signal chain of communication, that creates a great opportunity. There's other areas like connectivity, passenger connectivity, engine control. By the way, there's still the vast majority of cars that are built are using fuel-based engines or ICE vehicles and those require an enormous amount of different contents as well. Most of actually what we sell into cars is agnostic to the drivetrain. But it's not agnostic to the increase in content in cars. As there's more electronics, there's going to be more opportunities for Amphenol. Operator : Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Joseph Cardoso : This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Can you just give us an update on where we stand on the inventory destocking headwinds in the industrial market and how you're thinking about timing of when we see that normalizing? And then maybe as a quickie second, if I can. Can you just touch on the CapEx investments that you highlighted in your prepared remarks? How should we be thinking about magnitude and besides IT datacom that you mentioned, what are the other major buckets of investments there? R. Norwitt: Yes. I mean just very quickly on industrial. I mean, I think we continue to see the demand in industrial to be somewhat muted. There is no doubt an impact from destocking with distributors. But it's not just destocking. I think distributors'  orders themselves are also down. And so it's not just that they have too much inventory, but the demand in certain pockets of industrial. I would say, in particular, in places like Europe, maybe to a lesser extent in some parts of Asia and then even to a lesser extent, in North America.  With regards to our comments on CapEx. I mean I talked about it in the context of AI. But you can imagine, we're growing strongly in a number of our markets, including, in particular, in Defense. We grew last year in Defense by 20%. We grew last quarter by 11% organically. We continue to see strong momentum. And the defense industry uses also extremely high-technology products. We have a very vertically integrated capability and offering to our customers. And usually, you can't grow by 20% in Defense-related products. It's just impossible to flex. And I think our team has just done a fabulous job of flexing their capacity. But that may require a little bit more. But look, we're not talking about big numbers here. I mean we said we expect a slight elevation in CapEx. Our CapEx is still very, very reasonable. I think, Craig, it was less than 3% last quarter. And so this is not a big deal. We expect to still have very strong and robust free cash flow through the year. Operator : Our next question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. William Stein : I'm going to ask yet another on AI. We understand that the 3 main connector vendors in the space, Amphenol and 2 others have very solid positions, very good technical capabilities. I'm wondering if you can talk about the competitive dynamics among the 3 of you, and also the degree to which you can capture some of their share. Or whether it's possible, another entrant among the hundreds of connector companies globally could realistically attack this market. R. Norwitt: Thanks very much, Will. Look, I'm not going to comment on our peers. I have great respect for them. They're fabulous companies. What I will say is that we've been working in this area for a very, very long time. And as the leader in high-speed interconnect technology, you can imagine that we also have a very robust position here. This is not something that we have just recently developed. This is a very, very long, intensive and real leading position in development of those technologies. But I have great respect for all of our competitors. This AI is a great thing for our industry because it is really a multiple of content because of the unique architecture of these products. And we're not going to win 100% of everything, but I can tell you that we certainly get more than our fair share. In terms of new entrants, I mean, look, there can always be new folks who come along, these are among the hardest products that are made in the interconnect industry. And I think I already spent some time talking about the economics of those products and how those economics mean that as a customer, you want to be very careful to not use a product that cannot meet the requirements that you need in these high-performance systems. Operator : Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Asiya Merchant : Great results. Just incremental gross margins, if I did the calculation here, right, we're -- sorry, operating margins are very strong. Maybe you can talk about how you guys think about the trajectory of those gross -- incremental margins as the quarter progresses or as the year progresses. And especially when you think about rolling in a pretty sizable acquisition in the back half, how we should be modeling for that? Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Asiya. Yes. No, we are really proud of the 21% operating margins here in the first quarter. I mean, first quarter typically is the more challenging quarter in the years, given the sequential quarter typical decline we have. And certainly, we always do a good job. But this quarter really, I think, is an outstanding quarter from being able to achieve 21% -- 30% year-over-year and really sequentially about 30%. And that's -- we did 10 acquisitions last year, as you know, and those acquisitions were significantly under our company average. So when you really pull out and look at the organic conversion on our 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, it's significantly stronger than the 30% that kind of in the reported numbers. And sequentially, kind of the same dynamic with the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, being well under the average profitability of the company. Sequentially, that conversion really is well under that 30% kind of in the face. So really strong execution by the team. I mean the team has done an outstanding job of really -- not only the teams that are growing, but also the teams that are impacted on the negative side. As you know, our industrial market is more challenged and a few other markets as well. And they've just done an outstanding job of controlling costs on the downside as well. So the combination of those 2 really has just turned into a really strong profitability for the company. I mean as we look forward, taking out CIT, I'll talk about that in a second. I would expect that, again, more normal profitability levels on incremental kind of revenue. If we talk about the 25% longer-term target, I would expect more in that normal range as we kind of get into more of the normal cadence from a pricing cost perspective that we're in right now. But no doubt our teams will continue to manage in a very strong level and do their best to maximize profitability as they have. But I think 25% or so is kind of what I would kind of expect as we kind of go throughout the year. Now when we layer in CIT, when CIT does close, we expect here by the end of Q2, there's no doubt that business is well under our average company profitability levels currently and there would be some impact on the profitability, on the margins, slightly from an operating margin perspective. And over time, we would certainly work and the team would work as Adam kind of mentioned earlier, to get those back up to the company average. But certainly, in 2024, we would expect some impact on the second half from a profitability perspective from them. But it's a great team, and certainly, we would expect over time to improve upon that. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Andrew Buscaglia : Following up on that question, CIT, I think at a great price. As part of a holding company, you guys alluded to maybe not run optimally. But is this integration, is this company a cost-saving story? Or if you look at CIT, their growth, historically, wasn't all that exciting. Is this more of an opportunity to reaccelerate their growth? Or is it both? And if you could comment like that potential margin dilution in the back half, what might that be at this point? R. Norwitt: Yes. I don't know that we have a specific number to give you for the margin dilution. I mean, we'll talk about it when we own the company. In terms of the priorities, I mean, every acquisition we make, we want them to accelerate their growth and make more money doing it. And so you can imagine that with the CIT team we're already talking about, to the extent that we can before closing, we're already talking about how do they both accelerate their growth, expand their market position, take advantage of being part of Amphenol, take advantage of the broader access that we have as a company, take advantage of the broader suite of technologies that we have to grow their business. And in turn, how do they take advantage of our low-cost manufacturing? How do they take advantage of the broader relationships we have in the supply chain? Whatever that may be. And also just how do they take advantage of now being part of a high-performance interconnect company like Amphenol? I will tell you, in years past, when we've seen companies improve their performance, some of that was just they came in and they saw, \"Oh my goodness, I didn't realize I could make that much money.\" And they just figured it out and made it happen. And it's not that we parachute in with a bunch of folks from headquarters or otherwise, but there is inside of the company so many great role models of organizations run by entrepreneurs, run by Amphenol and general managers who have just figured it out. And that is -- we don't have an Amphenol business system. We don't have an Amphenol way. The Amphenol way is just to liberate people, to give them the authority and to hold them accountable as entrepreneurs. And that mindset is very different from most other companies. And again, Carlisle is a fabulous organization, the parent company, but they're not an interconnect company. And I think CIT, as part of Amphenol with our unique culture, with our uniquely broad suite of products and relationships, I can't tell you exactly how they're going to do it, but I have a lot of confidence that they will. Operator : And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Joseph Giordano : Just curious like with the AI stuff, is there any inherent margin differential between the products that you're selling on these next gen technologies versus more traditional data center or versus like more of the company average? And then if I could, I asked your competitor this morning. But when you think about the CapEx that you need to do and the scale of what these customers of yours are thinking over a multiyear period is massive. How do you like bring that down to your own spend and like rationalize? Is this doable? Like how fast do we want to spend ahead of something that might be a 5-year story, like how do you balance that? R. Norwitt: Yes. Look, I may let Craig comment on the margins, except I mean, it's an easy answer. It's just like look, we make margins based on selling value to customers. If we can create value for our customers, then usually there's value for us to be had there. And I think that's basically what I would say in this respect. Relative to scaling and working with our customers, I mean, you can imagine that we have very intensive discussions with our customers in every market. Here, because of the economics behind it, because of the pressure on our customers and the big vision, you can imagine that we're having even more intensive discussions. And so this is not just like you get an order and then you say, \"All right, well, I'm going to go invest XYZ. I mean this is a very iterative, interactive discussion. But it's all done under the context of the Amphenol approach. These are -- it's not that we're making decisions here at headquarters and allocating capital. We have general managers making -- and having responsibility for specific products and they're going to figure out how do they satisfy the customer, but also knowing that it's their capital that they're spending. And if they spend more than they should, that's going to hit their P&L, not just going to hit Amphenol's P&L, it's going to hit their P&L. And that accountability of sort of from birth to death of a program is something that I think is very unique in our organization. And over time, when I think about why does Amphenol spend what we spend on capital expenditures, it is in large part because the ownership of that, the accountability, the authority for that is resident in individuals who also go to the customer every day, who also are in charge of the factory, who also are in charge of developing the products.  And when you have that comprehensive authority, you tend to make wiser decisions about this. And it's not like, well, I'm going to overinvest now and let the next person clean it up on my behalf. These folks are there for the long term and they own it all. And I think they're going to make wise decisions accordingly. Operator : Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks. R. Norwitt: Well, thank you very much. And again, thanks to everybody for your time today. We appreciate everybody's attention. And I wish that everybody has a fabulous spring, and we'll talk to you again in 90 days or so. Take care. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our second quarter 2024 conference call. Our second quarter 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends and then we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition as a result of our recently announced two-for-one stock split effective on June 11, 2024 all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the second quarter with record sales of $3.610 billion and GAAP and record adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 and $0.44, respectively. Second quarter sales were up 18% in US dollars, 19% local currencies, and 11% organically compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sequentially sales were up 11% in US dollars and in local currencies and up 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.061 billion, up 33% to the prior year and up 21% sequentially resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.12:1. GAAP operating income and operating margin were $699 million and 19.4%, respectively, which included $70 million of acquisition related costs primarily associated with the CIT acquisition. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $769 million resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.3% in the second quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis operating margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year quarter and 30 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the modest increase in adjusted operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions made in the second quarter particularly CIT, which is currently operating well-below the company's average profitability levels. We are very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the second quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down second quarter results by segment compared to the second quarter of 2023. Sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.046 billion, an increased by 18% in US dollars and 1% organically and segment operating margin was 24.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.445 billion and increased by 24% in US dollars and 23% organically segment operating margin was 24.3%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.119 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 7% organically and segment operating margin was 18.2%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 21.9% and 24% in the second quarter of 2023 respectively. We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be at 24% in the third quarter and for the full year of 2024. GAAP adjusted EPS was $0.41 in the second quarter, up 11% compared to the prior year period. And on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 22% to a record $0.44 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $664 million or 120% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending our free cash flow was $528 million or 95% of adjusted net income. We are pleased to have continued to deliver a strong cash flow yield in the quarter despite our slightly increased levels of CapEx. I would note that while our second quarter capital spending was higher than the first quarter, it was still within our normal range. We continue to expect somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the coming couple of quarters as we invest to support the growth we are seeing in the defense and IT datacom markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 84, 69 and 56 days respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $62. When combined with our normal quarterly dividend total capital return to shareholders in the second quarter of 2024 was more than $320 million. Total debt at June 30 was $5.4 billion and net debt was $4.1 billion and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, which included cash and sort of investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Excluding acquisition-related costs second quarter 2024 EBITDA was $900 million and at the end of the second quarter of 2024 our net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. As a result of the $1.5 billion US bond offerings completed earlier in the second quarter and the subsequent closing of CIT in May, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the third quarter. The company is in a very strong financial position and we continue to be well-positioned to fund future opportunities as they arise. In particular, we are well positioned to fund the pending acquisition of the own and DAS businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion, which we expect to close by the end of the first half of 2025. We will fund this acquisition through cash on hand and debt. Finally, as mentioned in today's earnings release, the company's Board of Directors has approved a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective preferred payments beginning in October of 2024. I will now turn it over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I'd like to extend my welcome to all of you here on the phone today. And I hope that you and your family friends and colleagues are enjoying a very nice summer so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight a few of our achievements in the second quarter. I will spend the few moments to review our recently closed and announced acquisitions. I'll talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and then we'll make some comments on our outlook for the third quarter. And of course, we'll have some time for questions at the end. Our results in the second quarter were stronger than expected exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by 18% in US dollars and 19% in local currencies, reaching a new record $3.61 billion. On an organic basis, sales increased by a strong 11% with growth in IT datacom, defense, commercial air, mobile networks, mobile devices and automotive, only slightly offset by moderations in the broadband and industrial markets. Importantly, the company booked record orders of $4.061 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.12:1. I would just note here that, our bookings were particularly strong from IT datacom customers focused on artificial intelligence or AI. Adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.3% in the second quarter, a strong 90 basis point increase from last year's second quarter. And adjusted diluted EPS grew 22% from prior year to a record $0.44. We also generated strong operating and free cash flow in the quarter of $664 million and $528 million, respectively, both clear demonstrations of the high quality of the company's earnings. And finally, as Craig mentioned, we announced this morning a 50% increase in the company's quarterly dividend to $0.165 per share, effective with our October dividend payment. Just want to say how proud I am of our team here this quarter as the results that they drove once again reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amidst a very dynamic environment. As you know, our M&A team has once again been very busy of late. I'm very pleased to announce that on May 21, we closed the previously announced acquisition of CIT, previously called Carlisle Interconnect Technologies. I'm very excited to welcome the talented CIT team to the Amphenol family, and we really look forward to realizing the benefits of the combined breadth of our company's highly complementary product solutions, which will enable us to offer our customers an expanded array of innovative technologies across the important commercial air defense and industrial markets. In addition, we're pleased to have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lutze. Lutze is a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for high-technology applications in the industrial markets. This acquisition includes two businesses, Lutze US based in North Carolina and Lutze Europe based in Germany. In May, we did close on the acquisition of Lutze U.S., which has annual sales of approximately $75 million. And we expect to close on Lutze Europe, which has annual sales of approximately $100 million, by the end of the third quarter of 2024. That's this quarter here. The Lutze acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market and, in particular, strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products. Finally, just last week, we announced an agreement to acquire the mobile networks-related businesses of CommScope for a purchase price of $2.1 billion. We're really excited to be acquiring CommScope's Outdoor Wireless Networks or OWN and Distributed Antenna Systems or DAS businesses. These businesses provide exciting mobile network solutions with advanced technologies in the areas of base station antennas and related interconnect solutions as well as distributed antenna systems. I just want to mention that, we're especially encouraged that the businesses that we're acquiring really make up the former Andrew Corporation portfolio of products, a company with a rich history of innovation and technology in the wireless industry. These businesses are expected to generate revenues of approximately $1.2 billion with EBITDA margins of approximately 25% in 2024. This represents operating margins in the high teens, including our current estimate of post acquisition-related amortization. We really look forward to supporting customers who are developing next-generation wireless networks around the world, with these advanced solutions, as well as with our own existing complementary interconnect products. Most importantly, we look forward to welcoming the approximately 4,000 employees of these businesses around the world. There's no doubt in my mind that these talented individuals will make great future Amphenolians. As we welcome these outstanding new teams to Amphenol, and we look forward to the future closings of Lutze Europe and CommScope OWN and DAS, we remain confident that Amphenol's acquisition program will continue to create great value for the company. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into Amphenol, remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our trends across our served markets, I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol, enabling us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the risks associated with any given market or application. So with that said, the defense market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter Sales in this market grew from prior year by a strong 14% in US dollars and 10% organically, driven by broad-based growth across most segments within the defense market. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter, driven in part by the earlier-than-anticipated closing of CIT. Looking to the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range from the second quarter levels, including the benefit of acquisitions. And we remain encouraged by the company's strengthened position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst today's highly dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their investments in both current and next-generation defense technologies, thereby increasing the long-term demand potential for Amphenol. With the addition now of CIT's highly complementary products to our portfolio, we're better positioned than ever to support our customers with new products and the capacity to supply them wherever they may be needed. The commercial aerospace market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter. We had another strong quarter with sales increasing by a robust 60% in US dollars and 9% organically from prior year, as we benefited from the addition of CIT during the quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Sequentially, our sales grew by 46% in US dollars from the first quarter, as we benefited from the addition of CIT. On an organic basis, our sales were flat sequentially which was a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the quarter. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to increase in the mid-40% range as we benefit particularly from a full quarter of CIT sales. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. Now with the addition of CIT, we offer the broadest range of high-technology interconnect products to our customers in this important area. With the ongoing growth in travel and thus the demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for expansion of our technology offering to this important market and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter and sales in the second quarter did grow 9% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, sales declined by 5%, as we saw moderations in most segments on a year-over-year basis of the industrial market. Sequentially, sales grew by a better-than-expected 7% from the first quarter, driven primarily by acquisitions but our organic sales were up slightly on a sequential basis. Looking at the third quarter, we expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit range sequentially, driven by the benefit of our recent acquisitions. While the industrial market certainly has been experiencing a pause as customers and distributors have adjusted their demand levels, we are encouraged to see some early signs of momentum growing in certain areas of the industrial market. In addition, with the additions this quarter of CIT and Lutze US, we now have an ever broaden \u2013 an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. This creates opportunities long-term for our outstanding team working in this market. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew 6% in US dollars and 5% organically, driven by strength across newer automotive applications. Sequentially, our sales moderated by 4% from the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. I would note that we did see some incremental softening of demand in Europe in the quarter. As vehicle manufacturers there moderated their production volumes and that was offset by a more favorable performance in North America and Asia. For the third quarter, we do expect sales to be slightly down from these levels, as certain automakers have slowed their summer production schedules. I'm truly proud of our team working in the automotive market. Our continued outperformance is yet another confirmation of the benefit of our team's focus on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. And this includes electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications. We look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 8% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 6% in US dollars and 7% organically as strength in smartphones and wearables more than offset moderations in sales related to laptops. Sequentially, our sales increased by 9% which was much better than our expectations for a mid-single-digit decline and we really did see sequential growth across all segments of the mobile devices market, which was encouraging. Looking into the third quarter, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 20% from the second quarter levels, as customers prepare for year-end new product launches. While mobile devices will always remain Amphenol's most volatile of end markets, our outstanding and agile team remains well positioned to capture any opportunities for incremental sales that may arise in 2024 and beyond. Our leading array of antennas interconnect products and mechanisms continues to enable a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, thereby positioning us well for the long term. The mobile networks market represented 4% of our sales in the quarter and sales grew by 13% in US dollars and 7% organically, as we did see the beginning of a recovery in our sales to network operators and wireless equipment manufacturers after a number of quarters of demand moderation. Sequentially, sales in the quarter increased by a strong 22% which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we do expect some moderation from the strong second quarter levels on traditional summer seasonality. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market, as operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems. Our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. Now with the pending acquisition of the OWN and DAS businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these next-generation networks for years to come. The IT datacom market represented 24% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in the second quarter grew by a very strong 57% in US dollars and 56% organically, driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in next-generation AI data centers. While the vast majority of this growth did result from our expanding position in AI Interconnect, we were encouraged to also see some improvements in base IT datacom demand. On a sequential basis, sales increased by a strong 29% from the first quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into Q2. Looking into the third quarter, we expect sales to grow modestly from these elevated second quarter levels. We're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. Indeed, the revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for Amphenol. Given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. With machine learning driving a more intensive usage of these highest technology of interconnect products, we're very well positioned for the future. And whether high-speed power or fiber optic interconnect our products are critical components in these next-generation networks and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter and sales did decline by 17% in US dollars and organically from prior year, as broadband operators continued to reduce their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were flat as we had anticipated. And looking into the third quarter, we expect a further moderation of sales sequentially. Regardless of this current muted demand environment, we do remain encouraged by the company's continued strong position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world. As they eventually increase their spending to increase network coverage and bandwidth in support of the proliferation of high-speed data applications to homes and businesses. Now, turning to our outlook, and assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant currency exchange rates. For the third quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.45. This would represent sales growth of 16% to 19% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 10% to 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. As is our usual practice, this guidance does not include acquisitions, which have not yet closed but does include CIT and Lutze US, both of which are currently operating below the corporate average level of profitability. I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment while continuing to grow Amphenol's market position and driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I just want to take this opportunity here to thank our entire global team for what were truly outstanding efforts here in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'd be more than happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go head. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. Adam, really impressive order growth over here. Big, big numbers. Can you just talk about how much of that was driven by AI? Are you seeing a lot of new programs kick in? And how do we square that with your expectation of a moderate increase here in IT datacom for the third quarter? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thank you very much, Wamsi. Look, we were very encouraged by the orders this quarter. And as I mentioned, our 1.12 book-to-bill far and away, the biggest driver of that was a very significant book-to-bill that we saw in the IT datacom market. And no doubt about it, I mean there's a significant portion of that, that is being driven by AI. And this is existing programs that we've already won, new programs that we are winning, a really broad array of momentum that we have across AI. And I think -- I'm just so proud of our team, who is leveraging our leading position in high speed and power to really continuing to win in these extraordinarily complex systems. And, yeah, as it relates to your question on the third quarter and the guide related to our sales, we shouldn't forget, these are some of the most complex interconnect products ever built that we are making in many cases. And they have to be that because what our end customers are trying to achieve with AI is really phenomenal. I mean, the phenomenal array of growth of these next-generation models that are being trained, the intensity of the interconnect, the requirements of both speed, high -- ultra-high-speed, ultra-low latency, the complexity of these systems, because you're effectively having to connect every GPU or TPU or whatever it may be to every other one in order to create this sort of fabric-like network. There is an enormous amount of technology involved in these things. And we've talked about also in the past that for some of these systems, it requires also some meaningful investments upfront. And while our CapEx last quarter was kind of in line with our normal historical, I think Craig did mention that we continue to expect some elevated CapEx here in the second half. And so I would say that the orders that we're getting from customers in many ways they have slightly opened the order aperture to maybe give us more confidence in, kind of, extending ourselves in those investments and as well in order to make sure that these significant new products with all the challenges associated with them that we're building the right capacities in order to do that. And I'm not talking about massive extensions in these order apertures, but these are not necessarily just orders for the next quarter alone. And so as we look at our order book, we look at our backlog related to AI, I mean it gives us confidence not just for the quarter ahead, but for a long-term to come. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll stick to the AI theme. Adam, maybe -- there's obviously a lot of focus on what does the AI opportunity really mean for Amphenol. So, I'm wondering if you could spend some time just framing on how do you see this opportunity playing out for you? Is it bigger with hyperscalers or with semiconductor companies for you? And is there a way to think about maybe how much of the incremental, let's say, $300 million of revenues you had in June was AI driven versus not? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Thank you very much, Amit. I mean, look, the answer is all of the above. I mean at the end of the day, there are folks who are spending money to build AI data centers. And those tend to play down to the chip companies. And I think what's unique about AI is these systems are so much more complicated, there's so much more technology embedded in them that, in fact, we are working through the stack of that entire chain in making sure that our products are doing the right thing at each level. And so I think from that perspective, it's a little bit unique compared to traditional IT datacom, where we work with just OEMs or just service providers. I say here, we work with companies up and down the stack and in significant ways, let me say that. In terms of the growth over prior year, I mean, you've characterized our growth, which is just over $300 million on a year-over-year basis. And I think what I -- how I described that was the vast majority of that growth really came out of AI. And we've been careful not to just put specific numbers. In fact, it's not always easy to tell what is exactly AI and what is exactly not AI. And so we've tried to be a little bit more directional about those numbers. And I think we've been consistent about that from really the beginning of the sort of advent of this revolution. But I think you can safely say, it's the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis. And then on a sequential basis, just to give another data point, I would say that the strong majority of our growth on a sequential basis, but not all of it. And we were encouraged on a sequential basis as well to see some growth in the base IT demand, which has been a long time coming. I think we all know, I mean that was not the easiest of markets over the last, I don't know, six to eight quarters. And it's encouraging for us to finally see meaningful growth from that sort of base IT investments, which we always expected would when they come. But no doubt about it, the vast majority of year-over-year, the strong majority of our sequential growth has come out of AI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, I'm actually going to switch gears here and ask you about the acquisition of CommScope particularly in terms of when you think about mobile networks and you mentioned you're starting to see somewhat of a cyclical sort of spending recovery from your customers. But I think investor perception generally for that mobile networks business has been that service providers don't really need to spend massively until we get to 6G. So maybe if you can sort of outline why now, why now the acquisition, how you're thinking about sort of the outlook for the next few years? And what drove sort of -- what drove the decision here to double down on this mobile networks business. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well thank you, very much Samik. Look and I'm just going to -- from a vernacular perspective, we'll call this Andrew. So it's not to confuse as anybody because we're not buying all of CommScope for buying the mobile networks business from CommScope which is essentially Andrew that was acquired by them in 2007. And Andrew is just a fabulous, fabulous company. I mean as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a rich legacy of technology and outstanding enabler of all the generations. I mean they go back all the way to 1G and 2G and 3G and 4G and now 5G as a core partner in enabling those next-generation networks and I think yes, for the last year or 1.5 years, we've seen more muted demand in mobile networks. We're encouraged to see that now. I'm not going to tell you that we're smart enough to have timed exactly this announcement to exactly when we started to see that market turn. I think that's more coincidental. This is a company that we have admired for a long, long, long time. It's a fabulous organization with fabulous people, fabulous technology. So that's not -- it's that -- we saw the market turning and then we decided to acquire it, but quite the contrary. These are lengthy discussions. So the why now, I think is not necessarily. I wouldn't tell you that there is a now. It just happened that this was the right time for them and the right time for us in how these discussions go. But the long term, I will say this, the long term for mobile networks is something that we do believe in as a component of the broad diversified presence that we have across the entire range of the electronics industry. And the fact is, all these things that we're talking about, be they AI or next-generation communications or mobile devices or whatever. We are accessing these things by and large through mobile networks today, not through fixed line. And by the way we cover fixed line. We still have our broadband business as a way to make sure that we're present whenever people are getting Internet through a cable or otherwise. But we've always said, we want to be present in a high-technology way as a partner to our customers in every way that people are accessing data. And over the long term, there's no doubt in my mind that the highest growth way that people are going to access data is through -- is in a disconnected fashion through mobile networks. And yes, there's 5G today, where there's still a lot of work to be done to build that out. There will be a 6G, there will be a 7G, there will be an 8G. I've been in the company long enough to have watched these generations unfold and we want to be a participant in that. Doubling down. I mean sure, this is going to significantly expand our position in the mobile networks market which I would argue today is somewhat underrepresented 4% of our sales last quarter. But this is not doubling down for all of Amphenol in that respect. After we make this acquisition mobile networks may represent somewhere in the high single digits roughly of our sales. And I would also put that into context that over the last 18 months, we've made -- now we've completed 12 acquisitions and we've signed two others Lutze Europe and now Andrew to be -- that we'll be closing in the future. And we've made these acquisitions across the range of Amphenol of the served markets that we have, but in particular with the acquisition of CIT and a number of our other industrial markets those kind of slower cycle markets of commercial, air, defense, industrial, automotive those have been a little bit more concentrated there. And we do believe that having balanced across the faster cycle markets and the slower cycle markets, the communications markets being the faster ones, we think that balance is a very great thing for the company long-term and it allows us to continue to have great exposure to every corner of the electronics market. While not having overexposure and thereby being overly susceptible to risk should there be a problem in any given market. So we think this is a great strategic acquisition from a product technology perspective. It's great from a global customer relationship perspective. And it's great for overall Amphenol and what it brings. Not to mention that the 4,000 people that one day will join our organization, many of whom have worked for the company all the way back to the time when it was in fact Andrew they're going to make fantastic Amphenolians in the future. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Thank you for taking the question. Adam maybe a near-term question, but you mentioned in your prepared remarks that of course you've been seeing a pause in the industrial markets that you were encouraged by some early signs of momentum in the quarter. Could you just double quick on what you're seeing in some of those areas be geographically or by end market? And maybe if you could frame it up with what you're seeing in terms of orders as a leading indicator that would be helpful as well? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much Luke. Yeah. Look starting with orders. I mean, we were encouraged actually, I think I can't tell you how long it's been but to have a positive book-to-bill in the industrial market and not just like 101 :1. It was like a decently positive book-to-bill that we had in industrial. So that I would say is encouraging sign number one. I would say encouraging sign number two is that we saw with our distributors in particular on a sequential basis. But even on a year-over-year basis, growth in demand from our distributors, the demand they put upon us. And that's a great early indication that the kind of inventory corrections that were happening with the end customer and in the distribution channel those seem to be largely behind us. And I never want to be the guy to call a bottom, let me say that. But I'm encouraged that we actually had meaningful growth on a sequential basis in distribution from the first quarter, and when I say meaningful I'm talking about high-teens kind of growth rate on a sequential basis from distribution. And that's broadly from distribution, but also from the distribution that is within industrial. So I think those are good signs. If you look at our guide here for the third quarter, yes, we were on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter organically down, but we were actually up slightly sequentially in industrial. And then our guide for the third quarter would have us be kind of flattish sequentially on an organic basis. I mean, I talked about the fact that we will grow but that growth is really driven by the new acquisitions. So look this is not to say that all is perfect in industrial, but I think the cognition of the orders and the behavior of distributors those are two pretty good early signs. And as we get into the third quarter 90 days from now and we see how that goes, we'll certainly try to be able to give everybody a little bit more visibility to whether that is in fact happening. The last thing I would say is you mentioned geographical. There's no doubt that the industrial trends are diverging geographically. So we actually saw organic growth in the quarter on a sequential basis in North America and Asia and we saw continued organic declines in Europe. And so I think Europe is certainly not out of the woods right now, but it's encouraging that we see this in distribution. North America has maybe a little bit more distribution than Europe does and to see also the growth that we're seeing now in Asia. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. You may go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. Just double click on operating margins, really strong here in the comm segment. As you continue to see AI momentum here, how should we think about both incremental operating margins going forward? And just broadly EBIT margins going forward? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. Yeah. Listen we're really proud of the operating margins here in the second quarter and 21.3% record operating margins and that's obviously including part of the quarter where we have CIT which is well below the company average kind of in the low double-digit range. And so certainly proud of the operating margins. And certainly, that's driven by a bunch of factors, and I wouldn't focus it on one particular area. There was a few things happening here. Certainly, in some of the markets that are growing including IT data market and military and some others are certainly. Those businesses continue just to execute well on the higher growth rates. And the other side of that coin is we have certain markets in certain businesses that are not growing in industrial we talked about a little bit. And they're really doing a good job kind of on the other side of the coin to be able to kind of protect their margins. So overall, I wouldn't focus it on say one area, but I think as we continue to grow as we continue to be able to drive volume, we should be able to continue to drive our margins up and into that kind of 25% or so targeted conversion margins we talk about. Clearly, CIT here in the third quarter sequentially is going to have a bit of an impact and you see that in our kind of implied guidance from a sequential perspective. But if you look organically coming into the third quarter, we're still converting very well excluding kind of the CIT impact into those margins and we feel real good about the margins and the expansion potential as we move forward here in the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Spak with UBS. You may go ahead. Joe Spak : Thanks so much. I want to go back to Andrew's. So I'm getting the nomenclature right now. The -- just a couple of quick things. One, the 25% EBITDA margins you sort of highlighted on that deal. I mean, again, just looking at some of the historical looks a little bit higher. I just wanted to understand, if you were building in any sort of synergies or anything else into that? Or that's just a forecast. And then two, I noticed in the release you said EPS accretive ex-transaction costs and I'm sure you're still going through some of the deal amortization and the other issues. But you generally run that through. So is it also just straight EPS accretive? Should we expect that? Craig Lampo : Sure. Yes. No, I think this is just to start with the EPS accretion part. We haven't called that out, because I think it's a little bit far into the future to start calling out EPS accretion and certainly will be EPS accretive. It's a very its strong profitability. Adam mentioned in his prepared remarks, this is high teens operating margin, assuming kind of the amortization we would expect based on our current estimates post-acquisition. So, certainly, we would expect a good level of EPS accretion after the acquisition. In regards to the 25% EBITDA, there's certainly no synergies. We're not anticipating any synergies. We don't talk about synergies typically as you know our approach when acquiring companies and bringing them into the Amphenol family is we don't try to make significant changes. We kind of -- we essentially enable the businesses to expand margins while helping them do so as part of Amphenol. And that will be our continued playbook in addition to -- as we bring CommScope and we ultimately closed the Andrew's business there. So I wouldn't say that this 25% is -- that's what we view it as right now. I'm not going to talk so much about it's still part of CommScope's business and we're not going to necessarily talk so much about kind of what their expectations are and they're going to continue to report on this business and we'll let them do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Guy Hardwick : Hi. Good afternoon. Adam Norwitt : Good afternoon, Guy. Guy Hardwick : Hi. Thanks Adam for the background on Andrew Core. Just a question. Why so long to close? Because I think it's -- by your timetable is looking like a 10, 11 months to close compared to say four months of CIT? Adam Norwitt : Yes. No, look, I think in any company there's a process a regulatory process and they operate in a lot of countries, because they sell to mobile network operators around the world. And so there's -- when you have lots and lots of different geographies that can sometimes cause a little bit longer time period. But there's nothing more fancy about it than that. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. You may go ahead. Scott Graham : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to just understand the nature of the restructuring charge and maybe the payback on that? And if I could squeeze in a second one. Adam you commented that you were seeing some of your automotive manufacturers slowing production. I'm hoping you could elaborate on that. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yes. I mean, I don't know what restructuring charge you're talking about. We did talk about a $70 million acquisition-related charge, which is acquisition expenses, which includes the money that we pay to various advisers who help us do the deal together with some amortization of backlog and things like that. This is not a restructuring charge. You usually will not hear Amphenol talking about restructuring. Relative to auto, I think, what I mentioned is that we do see -- in particular, I would say, in Europe that some of the demand expectations for our customers going to the third quarter are a little bit more muted. But our guide is this is not a severe change in the volumes. It's just a very modest change here in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. I wanted to check on mobile devices. Correct me, if I'm wrong, I think you said you're guiding that up 20% sequentially. And presumably there's some renewed optimism around, that's being driven by an upgrade cycle of devices. Can you talk about first off, can you confirm that and then secondly, how do you in past cycles tend to participate in upgrade cycles that this work to do on \u2013 is it earlier on, later on or how does that play out in line? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Andrew. I mean look, I think we had a very strong second quarter in mobile devices, much stronger than we anticipated coming into the quarter. And now with a guide of 20% sequential growth on a higher than we had anticipated baseline here in the third quarter I mean it's \u2013 I think that's a fairly positive view. Is that due to upgrade cycles? I mean yes, I guess every year mobile devices there's new releases. These are very short life cycle products. And so there tend to be new products every year. Whether there's a more significant upgrade cycle I wouldn't tell you that that's necessarily what we're sort of discounting for here. As always, we have a team of folks who work in mobile devices, who are extraordinarily agile. And we have demonstrated over many, many years of participating in this market that when there are additional sales to be had, when there is kind of more of a \u2013 I don't know the term folks use now super cycle of upgrades, we have always been able to capitalize and get more than our fair share of that. So we'll see what happens here this year. I think this is probably a more kind of a normal outlook that we would have and it remains to be seen. And to your question of when would we or how would we participate? I mean if people are making more devices then we'll sell more components to go on those devices. And when they build those will depend largely on the type of demand that they see from their customers. And our job is not to anticipate that but rather to react in real time when there are changes in the demand. And if there are favorable changes, we\u2019ll manage through that and I'm sure we'll do well. And if there are not favorable changes, our team will adjust in real time to preserve the bottom line and that's how we've always operated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. With the CIT transaction and the proposed Andrew [ph] deals both over $2 billion and I think the largest Amphenol has done in its history. I was hoping you can help us to better understand if the degree of diligence Amphenol does changes for deals of that size including as you think about cultural fit. And how you think about the ability and your confidence in getting the margin performance and execution to more typical Amphenol levels over time when taking on these larger businesses? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks very much, Mark. I mean look, you can imagine that we are very serious in both our diligence but also in our interactions with the people. And the bigger the company, the more people you're going to want to interact with. I mean it's pretty linear from that perspective. And so we had a very, very significant review and diligence with both CIT and these businesses from CommScope, which we will just refer to here as Andrew. And both from a diligence integrity of the numbers but also from a cultural perspective, I mean, on one side, in terms of integrity, Carlisle and CommScope are both great companies. They're public companies. They report great numbers. So I think, yes, we do enormous financial diligence around them. But I think the starting point is also, these are public companies with audited financials from extremely reputable big four auditing firms. As opposed to sometimes, you buy family companies and you almost have to sort of do a ground-up audit of them. And you don't have to do that kind of work here. But the cultural aspects, getting to know the people, understanding are they passionate about becoming part of Amphenol, do they believe in the business, do they see the potential, are they -- do they feel even liberated by being part of an interconnect company in the case of CIT, or being able to be a stand-alone business in the case of Andrew, this is really important because we always preserve the management. And we're not going to buy a company like this, if we hear from the management team that they're not committed to being part of our company going forward. And I can tell you that both inside CIT and Andrew, the folks are extremely passionate, extremely excited to be part of the Amphenol organization. Now, relative to margins, I mean, we've been making acquisitions for many, many, many years, as you know, Mark. And at the end of the day, we don't have just one recipe for how do companies improve their operating margins to bring up to at or above our corporate average. We believe that there are no sacred cows. Margin is price minus cost. And we seek to expose them to their sister and brother companies around the world, so that they can see some of the ways that other Amphenolians have gone about improving their companies in due course. And I think both the folks at CIT and in Andrew, and they have different levels of profitability, by the way, CIT is a lower profitability today, Andrew is actually operating at really nice levels of profitability. But we see with both of them long-term great opportunities, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And how that's going to happen, these are exciting businesses with lots of different inputs and outputs. And I'm very confident that the team will find a way, and we'll certainly help them do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Will Stein with Truist Securities. You may go ahead. Will Stein : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, congrats on all the deals you've announced recently, some really big ones in some storied companies, with Andrew in particular. And it sort of forces me to wonder about management's bandwidth to deal with all these and to potentially continue to look at deals. I know that you've added, I think, a new layer of management, that might have been several years ago, to facilitate potentially adding in bigger acquisitions. We're starting to see something like that. But I wonder whether you have the management bandwidth to continue to look at new deals and to do even more. Or perhaps, you're going to have to put a pause on deals for a while. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you, Will. I mean, look, you asked a question that is so close to my heart. And I think I've even used this with you before. I view my job as CEO of Amphenol really twofold to protect the culture of the company, and to scale the company given that culture. Call it, to protect and to scale. Not quite like the NYPD, to protect and to serve. And I think we can look back over these last, let's call it, 20 years, 25 years even. I've been in the company 26 years. I've been now CEO for 15.5 of those years. I think we've done actually an outstanding job of both of those things. I would tell you that the culture of the company today, across our more than 135, I don't know, 137 or so general Managers, that Amphenolian culture of entrepreneurship is stronger today than it has ever been before as its embodied across those people. The vibrancy and the strength of that entrepreneurship is amazing. I see it all over the world as I travel around to meet with our people. It is so unique and so powerful. But at the same time, we have scaled the company. And you correctly point out, two and a half years ago, we took a big step in the company's evolution with the creation of three divisions run by division Presidents. Each of those are reportable segments, but that was a natural evolution that goes all the way back to even the beginning of the 2000, 2003 when we created our first operating groups, where we had five of those. And that was the first time that General Managers didn't just report to our then CEO, who still happens to be our Chairman. We have a lot of continuity in Amphenol, as you know. And those groups expanded over time to the point where today, we have 15 of these operating groups. These are groups that are roughly $1 billion or so on average in size. We have the three global divisions. And that has created an enormous bandwidth for us both to pursue organic growth opportunities, which are still very, very critical and really core to the company, but also to continue to expand the range of our acquisition program and we've gotten the question over the years. You may have even asked it yourself, Will. As the company grows and if you roughly contribute about a third of your growth over the long term from acquisitions, that must mean either you have to do more deals or you have to do bigger deals. And my answer has always been, for the last 15.5 years, yes, some combination of the two, we will have to do. And I think we can look back and say, yes, we have continued to do that. We have continued to open the aperture of both the number and the scale of the deals that we do. And that is exactly related to that scaling up of our organization. It's interesting though. When you think about most companies and how traditionally they would scale an organization, you would build layers, you would build matrices, you would build really bureaucracies at the end of the day, but that's not what this has happened in Amphenol. In fact, whether it's the divisions or the groups, these are very lean organizations, but they're exactly what our lean headquarters once was before. I mean if you think about the -- when we had just 15 GMs reporting to the CEO, and we would make maybe one acquisition in a year or two. And then when we first started our five groups, maybe we'd make three or four. And now here in the last 18 months, we've made -- we've closed on 12 acquisitions, we've signed two more, and that's included the two largest in the company's 92-year history. And that is just a reflection of the successful scaling of the Amphenol culture. The fact is, is CIT and what we will call Andrew are in different divisions. They report to different division presidents. And you can bet that those individuals are working extraordinarily hard on getting to know the companies, doing the diligence like we discussed with Mark's question, and ultimately bringing them successfully into the Amphenol family. No doubt about it, we would not have been able to do this if we didn't have -- if we hadn't have evolved the organization. But today, we have really almost a limitless capability to do that and coupled with a balance sheet that is second to none that Craig has been such an amazing steward of. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hey, good afternoon. Just one more on CommScope. Can you just talk Adam a little bit from a technology standpoint how you plan on leveraging all the antenna portfolio you will have combined cable assemblies connectors et cetera, as part of one big organization that would be helpful. Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Look Steve I think it's early. We've just signed the deal and we're obviously going to go through a regulatory process here. And then once we get through that we'll certainly be very thoughtful about the company. But what I would say is this, I mean Amphenol has been in RF connectors from the beginning. I mean we invented the world's first off connector back in 1941. Andrew was really the innovator of antenna technology, one of the innovators in antenna technology for mobile networks. And I think the combination of those two rich legacies ultimately is going to create enormous value for our customers. And I can tell you having talked already to several of those customers, they feel very excited about Amphenol as a home for this important partner for them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Michael Anastasiou : This is Michael on for Joe. So, previously you guys adjusted like AI revenues are probably annualizing around $800 million, and there's probably a path to $1 billion or so for next year. Can you just provide any color on customers like CapEx ramp required to support this AI growth? And if you could provide any clarity on how margins compare versus the rest of the portfolio would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much. Again we've given I think some good directional guidance on the scale of this. I talked about the fact that the vast majority of our growth on a year-over-year basis is really growth in AI. And by the way we had some AI already a year ago in the second quarter. I think we talked quite a bit already about the order patterns and the potential CapEx required for this. I don't really want to repeat myself on that. What I would just say is that the customers they want to work with us because of our technology. And at the end of the day these products, these systems have such demands put upon them, the performance levels that they're being run at are so extraordinary that it is coming back all the time to do you have the product number one? And do you have the capacity and the competency to build that product, and that capacity and competency to build is something that we have demonstrated over many, many years, many different revolutions in IT datacom, but it does require for sure us to continue to make investments, so that we can support this real revolution in AI investments. Craig Lampo : And just from a margin perspective, we wouldn't call out any significant difference in the AI product line is certainly margin accretive, but not so -- not meaningfully different from the rest of the portfolio of products that we have. And it's a good business and we want all of our businesses to continue to grow and provide margin contribution which we expect that will happen. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Thanks for fitting us on. Just kind of going back to the industrial commentary. You talked about distribution growing meaningfully sequentially. Do you have a sense of underlying demand getting better? Or is this just the end of destocking. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much Saree. I mean look, I think the end of destocking usually just means that end demand starts to match with the demand put on us by the distributors, because it wouldn't be a restocking if you will. So if you think about, how that would normally go, customers start to reduce their demand. Distributors are left with too much inventory, they reduced their demand by even more. And then once they get to a level that they feel good about, then they try to sort of mirror their end demand with the demand put on us. So I don't think that our distributors are necessarily restocking but, probably they're matching what they're seeing. And that -- again, that's why I say, without saying that industrial is sort of booming here, I think the early signs of the positive book-to-bill that we saw together with the sequential and also somewhat year-over-year momentum from distributors is a good and positive early sign for industrial, but we'll see how it goes through the third quarter and through the end of the year. Operator : And I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much and we truly appreciate everybody's time today. And I do hope that all of you get a little bit of a chance to take some time off this summer and we look forward to being back with you here in the fall just 90 days from now. Thank you very much. Craig Lampo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings conference call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce today's conference host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO; and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter 2024 conference call. Our third quarter results were released this morning and I will provide some financial commentary, and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. And then, of course, we will take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements, so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. In addition, as a result of our previously announced two-for-one stock split completed in June of this year, all share and per share data discussed on this earnings call is on a split-adjusted basis. The company closed the third quarter of 2024 with record sales of $4.39 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.48 and $0.50, respectively. Third quarter sales were up 26% in US dollars in local currencies and 15% organically compared to the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 12% in US dollars, 11% in local currencies and 8% organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. Orders in the quarter were a record $4.412 billion, up 39% compared to the prior year and up 9% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.09:1. GAAP operating income was $819 million and included $64 million of acquisition-related costs in the quarter, primarily related to CIT. GAAP operating margin was 20.3%. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was $883 million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 21.9% in the third quarter of 2024. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 110 basis points from the prior year quarter and 60 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in the prior 12 months. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels, partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, in particular, CIT, which closed during the second quarter. I am very proud of the company's operating margin performance in the third quarter, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down the third quarter results by segment compared to the third quarter of 2023, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.194 billion and increased by 35% in US dollars and 3% organically, and segment operating margin was 23.8%. Sales in the Communications Solutions segment were $1.685 billion and increased by 32% in US dollars and 30% organically, and segment operating margin was 25.6%. And sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment was $1.160 billion, an increased by 12% in US dollars and 6% organically. Segment operating margin was 18.8%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 21.4%, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 18.2% and 24% in the third quarter of 2023. GAAP Diluted EPS was a record $0.48 in the third quarter, up 17% compared to the prior year period, and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 28% to a record $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $704 million or 117% of net income. And net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $476 million or 79% of net income. And as expected, our capital spending was somewhat elevated in the quarter due to investments we are making support the strong growth we are seeing in IT datacom and defense markets. In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending to further support our growth in these markets. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 87, 69 and 59 days, respectively, all within normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $65, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to our shareholders in the third quarter of 2024 was $308 million. Total debt on September 30 was $5.5 billion, and net debt was $3.9 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $4.6 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.6 billion, plus availability under our existing credit facilities. In addition, we expect quarterly interest expense net of interest income earned on cash on hand to be approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding acquisition-related costs, third quarter 2024 EBITDA was $1.30 billion. And at the end of the third quarter of 2024, net leverage ratio was 1.0 times. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and thank you all for joining our call here on a very beautiful fall day in Wallingford, Connecticut. And I hope that all of you are enjoying a very nice fall so far. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight our achievements here in the third quarter. And in particular, we'll discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. And then I'll comment on our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year 2024, and of course, we'll have some time at the end for questions. Our results in the third quarter were really strong and actually stronger than expected and exceeding the high end of our guidance in sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Sales grew from prior year by a very strong 26% in US dollars and in local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.39 billion. We're very proud to have that new sales record. On an organic basis, our sales did increase by 15%, driven by growth in the IT datacom, mobile networks, mobile devices, commercial air and defense end markets, and I'll talk about those details in a few moments. The company also booked record orders of $4,412 billion, representing a robust book-to-bill of 1.09:1. This was also driven especially by continued strength in the IT datacom market. Our adjusted operating margins reached a new record, 21.9%, in the quarter, and this represented a 110-basis-point increase from last year's third quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% from prior year to reach a new record, $0.50, in the third quarter. And then finally, we generated operating and free cash flow of $704 million and $476 million, respectively, in the quarter, and this is yet another clear demonstration of the high quality of the company's earnings. I just have to say, I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter, once again, reflect the strength of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to outperform in any environment. Now just here in early October, we're very pleased to have closed on the previously announced acquisition of Lutze Europe. Lutze is based in Germany with annual sales of approximately $100 million, and it's a leading provider of harsh environment cable and cable assembly solutions for diverse applications in the industrial markets. The Lutze Europe acquisition is a great complement to our broad offering of high-technology interconnect products for the worldwide industrial market. And together with Lutze US, it strengthens our range of value-add interconnect products for this very important market. In addition, we remain excited about the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, and we now expect that transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. We remain confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol. Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and then to successfully bring these new companies into the Amphenol family remains a core competitive advantage for the company. Now turning to our served markets. We're once again pleased that the company's end market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. Now this diversification, no question, continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application. Now starting out with the defense market, it represented 11% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew from prior year by a strong 16% in US dollars and 8% organically. This was driven by growth across really most segments of the defense market with contributions, especially from space, aircraft and avionics, communications and ground vehicle applications. Sequentially, our sales grew by 4%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. As we now look into the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the defense market to increase moderately from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens increase in sales. We remain encouraged by the company's strengthening position in the defense market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology interconnect products. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new products, as well as, very importantly, the capacities to build those products, we're well positioned to capitalize on this long-term demand potential. The commercial air market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and we had another strong quarter in commercial air with sales increasing by 123% from prior year in US dollars and 12% organically, as we benefited from the addition of CIT, which we closed back in the second quarter, as well as continued progress in expanding our content on next-generation commercial aircraft. Compared to the second quarter, sales increased by 37% sequentially, and were up slightly on an organic basis, and this was modestly lower than our expectations coming into the quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a high single-digit increase in sales. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase by more than 80% from last year, driven by the addition of CIT, as well as robust organic growth. I'm truly proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth in demand for jet liners, our efforts to strengthen our product offering, while diversifying our market position into next-generation aircraft are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for the expansion of our technology offering into this important market, and look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. The industrial market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in the quarter grew by 24% in US dollars from prior year, as we benefited from acquisitions. On an organic basis, our sales were flat, as growth in alternative energy, instrumentation, medical and rail mass transit solutions was offset by reduced demand in factory automation, heavy equipment, transportation and oil and gas. Sequentially, our sales did increase by 9% and from the second quarter and were up by 3% organically, which was somewhat better than our expectations coming into the quarter. While we are encouraged to see stronger growth in North America and Asia, demand in Europe did again slowed this quarter. Accordingly, looking into the fourth quarter, we do expect sales to moderate from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to grow in the low double digits, with the benefit of acquisitions partially offset by an organic moderation of sales. With the additions this year of CIT and L\u00dcTZE, we now have an even broader range of products and capabilities to offer customers across the diversified industrial market. I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offerings, both organically and through complementary acquisitions, has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronic revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. And this creates exciting opportunities for outstanding teams working around the world. The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by 4% in US dollars and were flat organically. Similar to the industrial market, while we did grow in North America and Asia in the automotive market, our sales in Europe declined from prior year. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into Q3. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to decline modestly from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range compared to prior year. I remain proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are some areas of the automotive market that have shown some signs of slowing, our team remains focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles. These include electrified drivetrains as well as a multitude of other exciting applications, and we look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased by 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% organically, and this was really driven by broad-based strength across applications in the mobile devices market. Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 38% and that was driven also by higher sales across all segments of the mobile devices market. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our sales to remain at these higher levels. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to be up in the high single-digit range compared to 2023. I'm very proud of our team working in the always dynamic mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales in the quarter. I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices, we are well positioned for the long-term. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales grew by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 19% organically, as we continue to see a recovery in demand from both mobile network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we now expect sales to decline seasonally in the mid-teens. And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the high single-digit range versus last year. We're encouraged by the recent strengthening in the mobile networks market. As operators ramp up their investments in next-generation systems, our team remains focused on realizing the benefits of our long-term efforts to expand our position in next-generation equipment and networks around the world. With the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, we look forward to participating even more strongly in these networks for many years to come. The IT datacom market represented 25% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in IT datacom grew in the quarter by a very strong 60% in U.S. dollars and 59% organically, and this was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in artificial intelligence applications, together with robust growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 15% from the second quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into the third -- coming into the quarter. As we look towards the fourth quarter, we do expect a further mid single-digit sequential increase from these third quarter levels. And for the full year 2024, we expect sales in IT datacom to grow by more than 50% compared to 2023. I have to say that we're more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team who is just doing an amazing job around the world in securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI, there's no doubt that this revolution in AI has created a unique opportunity for the interconnect industry and for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. Whether high-speed, power or fiber optic interconnect, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks, and this continues to create a long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Finally, the broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the quarter, and sales were down by 15% in US dollars and 14% organically as broadband operators continued to moderate their procurement levels. On a sequential basis, sales were down 3%, which was roughly in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect a further high single-digit reduction in sales, and for the full year 2024, we expect a mid-teens sales decline from prior year. Regardless of this current more muted demand environment, we remain encouraged by the company's position in the broadband market, and we look forward to continuing to support our service provider customers around the world, when they resume growing their investments to expand bandwidth and coverage to their enterprise and consumer customers. Now turning to our outlook and obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales in the range of $3.950 billion to $4.50 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.48 to $0.50. This would represent a sales increase of 19% to 22%, and an adjusted diluted EPS increase of 17% to 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our fourth quarter guidance represents an expectation for full year sales of $14.855 billion to $14.955 billion, as well as full year adjusted diluted EPS and of $1.82 to $1.84. This outlook would represent full year sales and adjusted EPS increases of 18% to 19% 21% to 22%, respectively. This has been a very strong year for Amphenol thus far in 2024 and I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow our market position, while driving sustainable and strong profitability through this year and into the long term. And finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team for their truly outstanding efforts here in the third quarter. There's no doubt that they worked extremely hard to deliver, especially this level of growth, and I'm truly grateful to them. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session period will now begin. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. You may go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, good morning, guys. Adam Norwitt : Good morning. Andrew Buscaglia : So obviously, a very robust quarter for IT datacom. And even you said slightly better than maybe you expected. So I think last quarter you were alluding to IT datacom, the non-AI portion, also starting to improve. So could you help us parse out how much of this sequential improvement is from AI versus non-AI? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, Andrew, thanks so much for the question. Look, I think we did start last quarter being the second quarter to see a little bit of stronger performance. And I would tell you here in the third quarter, the underlying IT datacom, obviously, with the caveat that we -- it's not always exactly easy to tell what product goes into what application. But our best assessment of it is that the underlying IT datacom market did show actually very, very strong growth this quarter. Now I will tell you that roughly the AI -- the products that we sell into AI represented a bit more than half of our overall year-over-year growth and about the same in terms of sequential. So, very strong performance for anything related to AI. We have a very significant position in AI, as you know well, but we were encouraged, very encouraged to see that the underlying IT datacom demand has grown. And there's no doubt that there is today a real rush to equip data centers, enterprises, consumers, service providers with this next-generation compute power with all the switching that's associated with that and the like. And I think that is driving a bit of a recovery in these products in quite a significant way for us here in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. You may go ahead. Luke Junk : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Adam, just hoping to double click on your automotive business. Clearly, a very dynamic market right now in terms of overall production volatility. You mentioned Europe, especially EV moderation, et cetera. Just given that backdrop, be curious what you're seeing in terms of the bookings pipeline right now, especially relative to your ability to continue to drive growth above market at or above the levels the company has driven historically. Is the market constraining your growth potential at all right now? Or the OEMs actually need more help from Amphenol in this environment? I appreciate the perspective. Adam Norwitt : Well, thanks so much, Luke. I mean a lot to unwrap there, but let me say this. I mean, I'm really proud of our team in automotive. I mean, on a year-to-date basis, we've just done a fabulous job of continuing to outperform and navigating what, as you term, is very much so a dynamic worldwide automotive market. And these dynamics are sort of multifaceted. There's the dynamic of drivetrain choice, and I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole, but for sure, the world is talking about this. There's also the dynamic of just overall demand in certain geographies and in particular, Europe, where it's been widely reported, and I'm probably not the first to say that there are some challenges in the overall European demand in automotive. And we see that on a related basis, I think in industrial. But what I'm really pleased with is, if you look this quarter, we did have still robust growth in Asia and North America on an organic basis on a year-over-year basis and that was offset in part at least by a moderation in Europe. So to your specific question about content and Amphenol continuing to outperform, we have every confidence that the momentum that we've had in gaining content, enabling new applications with our customers around the world, whether those be next-generation drivetrains, whether those be next-generation electronics in cars, connectivity, communications, antennas, sensors and the like, the breadth of the product offerings that we have, the capabilities to fulfill those offerings on a global basis, continues to put us in a very strong position with automotive OEMs, the world over. And our team just has to navigate those dynamics as they are. But the good news is, regardless of whether something is made in Europe, made in Asia, made in North America, regardless of whether something is a full electric vehicle, a hybrid or a full internal combustion engine, there is continuing to be a proliferation of electronics across all of those cars. And so it's up to us to make sure that we continue to drive our next-generation products into those platforms around the world. And I'm confident that our team is well positioned to do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Adam, there's been a fair amount of noise around your content when it comes to AI deployments. And if I sort of think of the number you just said about half of the year-over-year growth is AI-driven. Can you just talk about the breadth of your customer base when it comes to AI deployments? And if there's a way to maybe even think about how do your revenue stack up hyperscale versus XPU providers, and just the breadth of your offering there would be really helpful. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, Amit, thanks so much. I mean, look, we have really an outstanding breadth of offering into the IT datacom market and, in particular, into applications related to AI. And I think we've talked about this in the past. What's unique about AI is that we're working with customers throughout the entire stack of the chain. And that starts -- it starts with the people who have the money, and that's the web service providers. And there's only a limited universe of those, and we're very well-positioned with those companies. Through the OEMs, the people who outfit the data centers, the OEMs who make equipment to sell into those data centers all the way down to the chip companies who sometimes are creating designs and configurations of those things that are used. And I think that comprehensive aspect of our relationships has really served us well because it's not about an individual product, an individual program or whatever, it's about the collective efforts of the industry to build out artificial intelligence in kind of a big way. And I think that collective efforts are happening in so many different aspects. You have different types of chips being used, different architectures being used. But what ties them all together from an interconnect perspective is two things. They have to be high speed and low latency, and you've got to help them use less power. And those two things of the speed and latency on one side and the power efficiency on the other are where we come into play and we create value for our customers because we have the industry's leading high-speed products, the highest -- operating at the highest speed, the lowest latencies. We have industry's leading efficient power interconnect products, everything from power connectors, assemblies, bus bars and the like, everything that gets power all the way down to these power-hungry chips. And working on those complex architectures, as our engineers have done for many years, together with scaling out our capacity and capability on a global basis, so that we can meet this demand has really put us in a strong position with customers of the world over. And so I wouldn't get hung up on noise of one or another program or configuration, I would think much more about the overall opportunity that is here and the fact that we're, for sure, capturing more than our fair share of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And Adam, congrats on the strong results here. I guess, I'll follow-up to what Amit's question was. Adam, you talked in your prepared remarks about your team working hard to win or secure business in IT datacom on next-generation systems. Can you talk in relation to when you're seeing the robust growth numbers in IT datacom, what are we seeing in terms of content growth in of next-generation systems? How much visibility are you getting today in relation to what your content on a per unit basis, in some cases, looks like going to a next-generation system? And how are you positioned whether that next relation system uses more copper or fiber? How do you think about opportunities on both those fronts? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thanks very much, Samik. I mean look, we've talked in the past about the fact that the unique architecture of these neural network, machine learning, AI, whatever you want to call them, systems, is that you essentially have to create a very high-speed, low-latency mesh fabric so that the chips can all talk to each other. And that's -- and I am not an electrical engineer, the farthest thing from it. But I can tell you that it is unbelievable the type of interconnection requirements that are going on these -- in these systems. And that just means there is greater content and a greater role. I mean, we use this word content, but let me change that to talk about just the role that interconnect plays in the functioning of these systems. Because the role of the interconnect becomes really fundamental to whether these systems can operate. If the chips can't talk to each other at a high enough speed and at a enough low latency, then to go out and build a complex large language model or whatever other model you're trying to do, it just takes too long and the thing becomes obsolete before it's even completed. And so the ability to have these rapid calculations and comparisons and probabilities that come across these chips is, in many ways, dependent on the interconnect as a link to that. And thus, the content opportunity regardless of who makes what chip, regardless of how someone chooses to architect that, that content has gone up and will continue to go up. And we have a very strong position with customers, again, across that that stack I described earlier. Relative to copper and fiber, the good news for Amphenol is we're present in both, and we've made great acquisitions and been a strong innovator in fiber as well as in copper. But I think you also know very well that there are advantages to each. And when you think about power, you want to use copper as much as possible because optics has a much higher usage of power. And so the value that we can create for our customers is by stretching the capabilities of copper such that it can meet these ultra-high bandwidth demand. And that's something we've been doing for more than two decades. When I think back on the acquisition of Teradyne Connection Systems 19 years ago, that brought us into a leadership position of high-speed over copper. Back then, we were talking about things like five gigabits as being kind of an aspirational or 10 gigabits as an aspirational speed over copper. Today, we're achieving things like 200 and aspiring to 400 and 800, and who knows maybe beyond over copper. And that's the incredible value that you can create for customers by stretching the capabilities of copper through your engineering expertise. This is real value that you can create through engineering and technology, and I think our teams are doing that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citi. You may go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the results. If I can a little a little bit on CapEx. I think Craig mentioned bit on elevated CapEx here. And so if you could help me understand how long do we expect this CapEx run rate to exist? Are we at the end of the CapEx that you guys are putting in to support the IT datacom growth? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yeah. Thanks, Asiya. So if you think about kind of our capital spend, we talked about this last quarter a bit, and we said we would expect to be kind of elevated for certainly the next couple of quarters being this quarter. And I just kind of reiterated that here in the fourth quarter, we expect to be kind of a little bit elevated levels to drive this and support the significant growth we're seeing in both IT datacom, as well as, to a certain extent, to the defense market as well. I mean we're not giving guidance yet for next year, so I'm not going to necessarily comment specifically on what we expect for capital spend for 2025. But we do certainly continue to target kind of that 3% to 4% of sales from a capital perspective. I think nothing structurally has changed over kind of the mid- or long-term from our expectation of capital spend to kind of maintain our business going forward. Certainly, in years, we're going to see strong growth such as 2024 here, and certainly in other years, we tend to be kind of at the higher end of that range in years that we see kind lower growth, yes, I would expect to be kind of more in the middle of that range or so. So I think that that's how we expect our capital at this point. Certainly, we'll talk about 2025 more specifically, if we see elevated levels as we enter the year next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Spak with UBS. You may go ahead. Joe Spak : Thanks so much, everyone. Maybe two quick ones. One, I just wanted to understand, in the aerospace guidance you gave, whether you assumed any impact from the ongoing strike and if that's at all significant? And then last quarter, you talked about some industrial green shoots, and I know you mentioned today that North America, Asia, okay, Europe tough. Just wondering if there's, I guess, any further sprouting, and if you're seeing any impact from any of the China stimulus in that region? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Thanks very much, Joe. I mean look, relative to your first question on aerospace and strikes, I mean, look, we wish for all of our customers that they have peaceful relations with their workforce. And without commenting specifically on any customer, I'll tell you that our guidance always incorporates all the information that we have from our customers around the world, including within that market. In terms of the industrial green shoots, it's absolutely the case. The last quarter, we did talk about seeing some green shoots in industrial. And look, I mean, this quarter, we did see some sequential growth on an organic basis from prior quarter. But I will say that our view of the trends in Europe are probably a little more muted than maybe they were a quarter ago. I mean we're pleased with what we've seen in North America and Asia. We grew in industrial organically in both regions, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, but we've probably seen an incremental tick down in Europe. And what to look for there, I mean I think we'll have to watch. The automotive industry and the industrial -- the automotive market and industrial market in Europe are fairly tied at the hip as you know well. You have a lot of factory automation and machine tool industries and the like, which are somewhat dependent on the investment cycles that come from the automakers, who are such a big component of the European economy. And so I think we'll have to watch that and see how it proceeds. But look, in our organization, I mean, not to be cavalier about this, but like it is what it is. Like we -- our team is very used to this scenario where you tighten your belt and you put your head up high and got and take some business. And so to the extent that there is, in Europe, a moderation in these -- in a place like industrial and automotive, our team know how to deal with that. We've got a playbook. And to the extent that there are opportunities in other geographies, we'll work to capitalize upon those and take more than our fair share as they come along. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question. EBIT margins came in at a record high, even with a full quarter contribution of the CIT acquisition. So I'm hoping to better understand what led to the margin strength this past quarter? Maybe you can level set us on where CIT margins are running at this point, and if they're already at the levels you're targeting? And how should investors think about incremental margins going forward? Thank you. Craig Lampo : Yes. Thanks, Mark. We're really, really proud of our operating margins here in the third quarter. I mean, this year, we really have done a great job of really execution, and this really goes without saying here in the third quarter. The CIT margins, I would say, ultimately, we're not going to talk so much specifically about their margins. But I would say, they're still on their journey. That really wasn't a strong contributor here in the third quarter to the margin improvement, really, the margin improvement here was just the execution of the team and the ability for team to really just maximize the profitability on the strong growth that we've seen. And I think that as we go forward, we talk about this 25% conversion margin. We've done clearly better than that recently. I still think, over the long-term, 25% is kind of the way we kind of think about things, but the team really has been executing very well on this the strong growth that we've seen over the recent quarters. And I would expect as we continue to grow, we'll continue to be able to kind of execute well and increase those margins as we grow. As it relates to how long it's going to take us to kind of get CIT at the company average, we're not going to really talk about so much how long exactly we think, but we're certainly very happy with the progress so far. And certainly, I would say, today, even versus 90 days ago, I would say, I'm even more optimistic that, ultimately, that CIT will get to the company average. But this is just a great team. They're extremely motivated. They're excited to be part of Amphenol. And I think they're really making some great strides to take the steps they need to get those really great goals. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Guy Hardwick : Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the fantastic Q3 results. Adam Norwitt : Thank you, Guy. Guy Hardwick : Just -- obviously, it's great news that you can close Andrew a little bit closer than earlier than expected. Does that mean any sort of antitrust issues that you may have encountered or receiving? Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much. I mean, look, we never thought there were going to be any meaningful antitrust issues, but we knew that there would be a lot of filings to be done, because Andrew operates on a global basis in lots of different geographies. And you never know how long those things can take. And I think we're just encouraged by how the process is going and that gives us really the confidence to think that it's going be sometime in the first quarter as opposed to in the first half. But we -- again, just to reiterate, we never thought there were any substantive antitrust issues, but there's always a process to do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi. Good afternoon Adam and Craig. I was wondering if you could step back on the mobile device market. You called out that you're now going to see high single-digit growth for the year, which is kind of an interesting data point, even if it's off of a down year in 2023. Can you just sort of talk about what that high single digits is comprised of, how much you think it's content growth, what you think the markets are doing and what it implies maybe for next few quarters, roughly? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Steve. I will punt a little bit on your last part of your question, because I'm not very good at forecasting mobile devices even in one quarter, let alone the next several quarters. But let me do this, our team working in mobile devices has still done a fabulous job again this year. I mean, this is such a phenomenal organization. And you think about the technologies that we're working in, things like connectors, obviously, antennas, obviously, the mechanisms that we participate in. And there's no doubt that the content in many of these products, the breadth of content continues to expand. And if I think back on a phrase that I've used for many, many years, probably almost entirety my nearly 16 years here doing these calls as CEO. It's that when the hardware creates value for the customers, then our products can create value for our customers. And there's no question that you see continued innovations in the things themselves and the devices and those ultimately result in just really, really beautiful products that are coming out. And our team is helping to make those beautiful products. And the more functionality that comes into them, the more opportunity there is ultimately for us. Now look, all of that is with the caveat to tell you that this is a very fickle dynamic volatile market. And so we're guiding the market here in the fourth quarter to stay at these pretty robust levels that we achieved in the third quarter. And hopefully, I'll be right about that, but time has told that I'm usually not spot on in even guiding in a 90-day period on mobile devices. But there is no doubt. I mean -- and maybe I'm a power user of these mobile devices. I mean, I have them sitting all around me at all times. I use them constantly. We have learned, I think, the extraordinary things that you can do with mobile devices and what used to be just a phone becomes a tablet, a wearable, hearable device. The line gets blurred between all of these things, but ultimately, they allow you to communicate and to be productive. And I think that our customers continue to push the limits of that that productivity and communication such that consumers ultimately want to buy the product. So I think that's where we stand today. Next year, who knows what it's going to be, Steve, we still see. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Scott Graham with Seaport Research Partners. You may go ahead. Scott Graham : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, and great quarter. I was hoping you would perhaps comment on organic orders in the quarter and maybe call out, which verticals were maybe stronger versus those, which were weaker? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. I mean we don't really talk about organic orders, like if you're talking about order growth or something like this. I mean, our book-to-bill is what it is because we acquire a company and they have bookings greater than their revenues, that's still organic book-to-bill, and I think our strong book-to-bill is a total reflection of the companies that we own, not being on prior to being part of Amphenol. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yeah. Thank you so much. Adam, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the aperture of these orders, again, like a very strong order number, can you talk about maybe, one, the visibility that you have around these orders? And how far out maybe some of these orders are? Like how much would you fulfill current quarter versus maybe next? Are these stretched out even beyond that, that would be helpful? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yes. Well, thanks very much, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Look, I have mentioned, I think, last quarter, and I'll reiterate it again this quarter that these are very strong books book-to-bill. And in particular, we see those strong books-to-bill in IT datacom first and probably defense and comm air to a somewhat lesser extent. And there's no doubt that we have seen a bit of the order aperture opening. And I would actually relate that also to the fact that we're spending more on capital spending. And Craig already talked about CapEx. And you can imagine, when we think about spending a little bit more than we're used to on capital that we work with customers to make sure that we have assurance that, that capital is going to be used, and that assurance often comes in the form of orders. It can also come in the form of contributions or guarantees. And so there's some extent of that order aperture that's a little bit longer that is there to give us the comfort and security that we'll be making those investments, which may be more significant than is typical. In terms of how far out, I mean, look, we'll never book anything -- we don't record any booking that's more than a year out in our numbers. That's a sort of even an accounting rule some sort internally. But the vast majority of our orders would be fulfilled within a couple of quarters. And I can't tell you are there some of those that poke out into three quarters out occasionally, that could be on an occasional basis. But I would say the vast majority would be within a couple of quarters. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may go ahead. Joe Giordano : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, you hinted at this, and you've done it, you said calls historically about how you guys motivate your people to go find new business in new markets, if it's not in your current one. Like I'm just curious, what you're doing now in and the money you're spending there and the success you're having, like is there an ability to scale that to markets that are not currently using it? And I guess the other side of this, the people in that IT sector that are running full tilt it to meet demand now, like how do you prepare them for times when it's not going to be growing 50% a year to make sure that the business kind of stays at high levels and when growth ultimately kind of starts to moderate? Adam Norwitt : Yes, Joe. I mean, look, excellent question. I mean, first, what you get to here with -- you're talking about kind of two sides here, how do you motivate people to get new business maybe when they don't have it? And how do you motivate people to keep working as hard as they do, knowing that maybe there can be always volatility? And I think that's really the Amphenolians way. I mean if you get to the essence of our culture of entrepreneurship, it really boils down to agility, reactivity, flexibility, which is kind of -- those are three words that kind of mean the same thing. I understand that. And that just means you always thinking about -- in a difficult time, you're planting seeds, you're aggressively going out there and finding ways to proliferate your technology into other applications. And there may be a multitude of ways of doing that. I mean I still remember anecdotally, the folks in our business who worked in oil and gas at the time when the price of oil dropped by 60%, 70% from like more than $100 down to $40, and they realized that they weren't necessarily just selling oil and gas connectors, they were selling really high-voltage, high-power products that went into ultra-harsh environment. So, how do you go and find a new application for those ultra-high-voltage, ultra harsh environment products that may not be oil and gas. And then lo and behold, you do that work for some time, you may be develop some new opportunities for those technologies and along comes that market recovering once again. And now you've got a more stable base, kind of a second or third leg of the stool. By the same token, when you're in a really strong market and there's no doubt about it. I mean, our folks working in IT datacom, they grew 60% on a year-over-year basis. We have individual operations that grew by a heck of a lot more than that, you can imagine. This is hard, hard work. I mean I just -- I said it earlier in my prepared remarks, but I cannot commend enough our folks working around the world on these products and the sacrifices that they have made personally, weekends, nights, travel, missing family events and the like. I mean it is -- it's humbling to me, let me tell you, to just bear witness to what these folks have done and thereby, achieved and which -- I get to talk about just some numbers here, but these guys have put their heart and soul into the matter. But everybody in Amphenol, regardless of where they are, they're always putting one foot on the gas and on one the brake. They're thinking with each investment, what if this goes down, what is inevitably there is a cycle? And they're managing their business accordingly. So, that one day, when there is a cycle. I mean, we're a diversified company. We've been around for 92 years. We know that business goes in cycles. And it's our job to maximize our business on the -- when those cycles are strong and to moderate the impact when those cycles are not strong. And I think we've demonstrated that over a couple of decades through every cycle, whether those are big cataclysmic cycles like the global financial crisis, the Internet bubble burst in COVID, where we've moderated the impact of this on the downside. Our margins dropping just 300 basis points peak to trough in each of those cycle. And we've also done it in those little cycles across businesses, the best example being our mobile devices' team who probably deals with the cycle three times a year. I mean they are, every quarter, having one of these cycles, growing massively. I mean, look, they grew by 38% sequentially in our mobile devices team from Q2 to Q3. And probably in Q1, they're going to go down by a decent amount at that time. And so there's no doubt about it. And the IT datacom team, this team who is working on AI, they have also gone through their own cycles, whether it was before COVID, coming out of COVID when we saw a flood of demand so that people could communicate with their families and relatives, and all of and all of this -- the stuff that happened through the building of the Internet and thereby, the kind of inventory that was built up thereafter. And so I'm very confident in our team that not only are they going to maximize their performance here. But when inevitably a cycle comes and I'm certainly not going to be the one to pick when that cycle will be, we'll be ready for it as Amphenolians always have been. Operator : Thank you. And that was our last question. I will turn it back to Mr. Norwitt for any closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much to all. And I'm really grateful to have all of you on the phone here today, and I wish that you have a great finish to the year. And hard to say it, but we'll talk to you all in 2025. Thank you. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation. Following today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Until then, all lines will remain in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference host -- over to your host, Mr. Craig Lampo. Sir, you may begin. Craig Lampo : Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO. And I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year and welcome you to our fourth quarter 2024 conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business and current market trends. Then, we will of course take questions. As a reminder, during the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures and make certain forward-looking statements. So, please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information. The company closed the fourth quarter of 2024 with record sales of $4.318 billion and record GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.59 and $0.55, respectively. Fourth quarter sales were up 30% in US dollars and in local currencies and up 20% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales were up 7% in US dollars, in local currencies and organically. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. For the full year 2024, sales were $15.223 billion, up 21% in US dollars and in local currencies and up 13% organically compared to 2023. Orders in the quarter were a record $5.14 billion up 58% compared to the prior year and up 14% sequentially, resulting in a strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 to 1. For the full year, orders were $16.835 billion, up 37% compared to 2023, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11 to 1. GAAP operating income was $954 million and included $12 million of acquisition-related costs in the quarter, primarily related to the pending acquisition of the Andrew business from CommScope. GAAP operating margin was a record 22.1%, which increased 140 basis points and 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '23 and the third quarter of '24, respectively. Excluding these acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of '24 was $966 million, resulting in a record adjusted operating margin of 22.4%. On an adjusted basis, operating margin increased by 120 basis points from prior year quarter and 50 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating margin was primarily driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. On a sequential basis, the increase in adjusted operating margin reflected strong conversion on the higher sales levels. For the full year of 2024, GAAP operating income was $3.157 billion, which included $146 million of acquisition-related costs. Full year GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to 2023. Excluding acquisition-related costs, full year 2024 adjusted operating income was $3.303 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 21.7%, also a record. Compared to 2023, adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points, which was primarily driven by the strong operational performance on the higher sales levels, partially offset by dilutive impact of acquisitions. I am very proud of the company's record operating margin performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflects continued strong execution by our teams. Breaking down the fourth quarter results by segment compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $1.262 billion and increased by 40% in US dollars and 8% organically and segment operating margin was 24.2%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $1.928 billion and increased by 43% in US dollars and 42% organically, and segment operating margin was 26%. Sales in the Interconnect and Sensor Systems segment were $1.128 billion and increased by 4% in US dollars and 3% organically and segment operating margin was 18.6%. Breaking down full year results by segment compared to the full year 2023, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $4.117 billion -- sorry, $4.417 billion and increased by 25% in US dollars and 4% organically and segment operating margin was 24.7%. Sales in the Communication Solutions segment were $6.324 billion, and increased by 29% in US dollars and 27% organically and segment operating margin was 24.8%. Sales in Interconnect and Sensor Systems were $4.482 billion and increased by 9% in US dollars and 4% organically and segment operating margin was 18.4%. The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.4% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 22% and 24% in the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. For the full year 2024, the company's GAAP effective tax rate was 18.9% and the adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, which compared to 20.7% and 24% in 2023, respectively. We currently expect a 0.5 point increase in our effective tax rate in 2025 compared to 2024, bringing our tax rate to 24.5%. This is primarily driven by our expectation of a slightly less favorable income mix in 2025, and our first quarter guidance assumes this higher 24.5% tax rate. GAAP diluted EPS was a record $0.59 in the fourth quarter, up 44% compared to the prior period and on an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased 34% to a record $0.55 compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2023. This was an excellent result. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was a record $1.92, a 24% increase from $1.55 in 2023 and adjusted diluted EPS was a record $1.89 in 2024, an increase of 25% from $1.51 in 2023. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $847 million or 114% of net income and net of capital spending or free cash flow was $648 million or 87% of net income. This was an excellent result, especially considering that our capital spending was somewhat elevated in the quarter due to investments we are making in support of the strong growth we are seeing in IT datacom and defense markets. We expect to continue to have somewhat elevated levels of capital spending in the first quarter as we continue to invest to support the significant growth that we are seeing in the IT datacom market, particularly related to AI applications. For the full year 2024, operating cash flow was a record $2.815 billion or 116% of net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $2.157 billion in 2024 or 89% of net income, a strong result. From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 80 days, 68 days and 58 days, respectively, all within our normal levels. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $70, and when combined with our normal quarterly dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $368 million and $1.280 billion for the full year of 2024. Total debt on December 31st was $6.9 billion and net debt was $3.6 billion, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $6.3 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $3.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. Until the previously-announced acquisition of the Andrew business from CommScope closes, we expect quarterly interest expense, net of interest income earned on cash-on-hand to be approximately $45 million, which is reflected in our first quarter guidance. We continue to expect the CommScope acquisition to close in the first quarter of 2025. Excluding acquisition-related costs, fourth quarter and full year 2024 EBITDA was $1.137 billion and $3.902 billion, respectively. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, our net leverage ratio was 0.9 times. We are very pleased that the company's financial condition remains strong by any measure. I will now turn the call over to Adam, who will provide some commentary on current market trends. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you very much, Craig, and I hope it's not too late to wish everybody here on the call a Happy New Year from frozen Wallingford, Connecticut. And I hope all of you are able to stay warm on this very chilly, but beautiful winter day. As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the fourth quarter and the full year. I'll then discuss our trends across our served markets, and then I'll comment on our outlook for the first quarter, and of course, we'll have time for questions. With respect to the fourth quarter, the company had a very strong finish to a successful 2024 with sales and adjusted diluted earnings per share both exceeding the high end of our guidance here in the fourth quarter. Sales grew by 30% in US dollars and local currencies, reaching a new record of $4.318 billion. And on an organic basis, our sales increased by a very strong 20% with growth across virtually all of our served markets. The company booked just over $5 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, also a new record for the company and representing another strong book-to-bill of 116 to 1. Orders grew by a very strong 58% from prior year and were also up 14% sequentially. These strong orders were once again driven primarily by data center demand related in particular to artificial intelligence or AI investments by a number of our large customers. We're pleased to have delivered record adjusted operating margins of 22.4% in the quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. I would just say that this superior profitability is a direct result of the outstanding execution of the Amphenol team around the world. Adjusted diluted EPS in the quarter grew by 34% from prior year and reached a new record of $0.55. Finally, the company generated record operating cash flow of $847 million as well as free cash flow of $648 million in the fourth quarter, both clear reflections of the quality of the company's earnings. I just have to say that I can't express enough my pride in the Amphenol team. Our results this quarter once again reaffirmed the value of the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we have continued to perform well amidst the very dynamic environment. Now, turning to the full year of 2024. I just want to say that this was a truly successful year for Amphenol. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 21% in US dollars and local currency and 13% organically, reaching a new sales record of $15.2 billion. As we cross $15 billion in sales in 2024, our organization is proud that we have grown our sales by 40% just in the last three years, and it's a great reflection of our organization's ability to navigate market uncertainties while capitalizing on the broad array of opportunities arising across the electronics industry. Our full year 2024 adjusted operating margins reached a record 21.7%, an increase of a full 100 basis points from prior year, and this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve record adjusted diluted EPS of $1.89. And finally, we generated record operating cash flow of $2.815 billion and free cash flow of $2.157 billion, clear confirmations of the company's superior execution and disciplined working capital management. Also very pleased that our acquisition program again created great value in 2024. We completed the acquisition of Carlisle Interconnect Technologies, our largest ever, together with the acquisition of Luetze US and Europe. These acquisitions have collectively added annualized sales of more than $1 billion to the company while enhancing Amphenol's position across a broad array of technologies and bringing outstanding and talented individuals into our family. In addition, as previously announced, in July, we signed the acquisition for the Andrew businesses from CommScope. This outstanding acquisition, which we still expect to close here in the first quarter of 2025 will also strengthen the company's position in the global communications market while adding incredible technologies and team members to Amphenol. We returned substantial cash to shareholders in 2024, buying back 11.1 million shares under our share repurchase program and increasing our quarterly dividend by 50%. And this represented a total return of capital to shareholders of nearly $1.3 billion. As we enter 2025, I remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Our agile entrepreneurial organization has created a new position of strength from the company from which we can continue to drive superior long-term performance. Now, turning to the trends and our progress across our diversified served markets, I would just comment that we're very pleased that the company's end-market exposure remains highly diversified, balanced and broad. This diversification continues to create great value for Amphenol because it enables us to participate across all areas of the global electronics industry, all while not being disproportionately exposed to the volatility of any given market or application. So, turning first to the defense market. This market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 11% of our sales for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 16% in US dollars and local currency. On an organic basis, sales increased by 9% with broad based growth across virtually all defense applications, and this included in particular space, ground vehicles, avionics, airframe and communications. Sequentially, our sales increased by 4%, which was in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2024, our sales grew by 15% in US dollars and local currency and by 9% organically and this reflected our superior operational execution together with growth across really all segments of the defense market. I would just note here that our growth in 2024 was particularly strong in Europe and that reflected our broad and leading position across the many countries there who are increasing their defense spending. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to remain roughly at these levels. And we remain encouraged by the company's leading position in the defense interconnect market, where we continue to offer the industry's widest range of high-technology products. Amidst the current dynamic geopolitical environment, countries around the world are expanding their spending on both current and next-generation defense technologies. With our investments in the development of a broad array of new products as well as in the capacities to build them around the world, we're well-positioned to capitalize on this long-term demand potential. The commercial air market represented 6% of our sales and for the full year 2024 and in the fourth quarter, sales grew by a strong 137% in US dollars and local currency and on an organic basis, our sales increased by 18% from prior year, and this was really driven by broad-based strength with virtually all commercial aircraft manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales grew as expected by 7% from the third quarter. For the full year 2024, our sales increased by 86% in US dollars and local currency as we benefited from the acquisition of CIT as well as from strong underlying growth in the market. And in fact, organically, our sales increased by 15% from prior year and that really did reflect our robust design-in position on a broad range of jetliner platforms. Looking into the first quarter, we expect sales to moderate in the high -- mid-to-high single-digit range sequentially. I'm just really proud of our team working in the commercial air market. With the ongoing growth and demand for aviation, our efforts to expand our product offering both organically and through our acquisition program are paying real dividends. We continue to see great long-term opportunities for our technology offering in this important market, and we look forward to realizing the benefits of our growth initiatives for many years to come. Now, turning to the industrial market, this market represented 23% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year 2024. Our sales in the quarter grew by 26% in US dollars and local currency from prior year. And on an organic basis, we were pleased that sales grew by 6% from prior year with growth in instrumentation, alternative energy, battery and electric heavy vehicles, medical as well as rail mass-transit applications. On a sequential basis, our sales grew by 3%, which was better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2024, sales grew by 14% in US dollars and local currency as we benefited from the impact of our acquisitions. Organically, sales declined by 2% from prior year as strength in rail mass transit, alternative energy and medical applications were more than offset by moderations in other markets. Looking into the first quarter of 2025, we now expect sales to decline in the low-single digits from these fourth quarter levels. I will say that in 2024, despite the overall market moderation, we did continue to expand our range of products and capabilities in service of the diversified global industrial market. Demand did moderate in particular in Europe this year, but we remain encouraged by the company's strength across the many diversified segments of this important market. As demand now begins to improve, I'm confident that our long-term strategy to expand our high-technology interconnect antenna and sensor offering, both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned us to capitalize on the many electronics revolutions that will no doubt continue to occur across the industrial market. The automotive market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter and 20% of our sales for the full year. Sales in the fourth quarter were down by 3% in US dollars, local currencies and organic, and that was really driven particularly by lower demand from European customers, which more than offset organic growth in North America and Asia. Sequentially, our automotive sales increased by 1%, which was a bit better than our expectations coming into the quarter. For the full year 2024, our sales increased by 6% in US dollars and local currencies and by 4% organically, and this was driven particularly by strong performance in North America and Asia, which was partially offset by reduced demand in Europe. Looking into the first quarter of 2025, we expect a seasonal moderation in sales from this quarter's levels. I just want to say that I'm really proud of our team working in the automotive market. While there are clearly some uncertainties in the market, in particular in Europe, our team remains focused on driving new design wins with customers who are implementing a wide array of new technologies into their vehicles, and this includes everything from electrified drivetrains to a whole multitude of other exciting applications that we're working on and we look forward to benefiting from our strong position in the automotive market for many years to come. The mobile devices market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter and 9% of our sales for the full year. In the fourth quarter, our sales grew by a robust 15% in US dollar, local currency and organically as strong growth in smartphones, laptops and wearables was only partially offset by a moderation in sales into tablets. Sequentially, our sales increased by 7%, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And for the full year, I'm really pleased that our sales in the mobile devices market increased by 11% in US dollars and organically, and this was driven by growth in virtually all mobile device applications. As we look into the first quarter of 2025, we do anticipate a typical seasonal sequential decline in the sort of mid-30% range. I'm very proud of our team who is working in the always dynamic and volatile mobile devices market as their agility and reactivity have once again enabled us to capture incremental sales here in the fourth quarter. And I'm confident that with our leading array of antennas, interconnect products and mechanisms designed in across a broad range of next-generation mobile devices that we're positioned very well for the long term. The IT datacom market represented 27% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 24% of our sales for the full year. Sales in this market grew by a very strong 76% in US dollar, local currency and organically, and this was driven by the continued acceleration in demand for our products used in AI applications, together with continued growth in our base IT datacom business. On a sequential basis, sales increased by 17% from the third quarter, substantially better than our expectations coming into the quarter. This sequential growth was driven essentially by growth in AI-related applications. For the full year 2024, our sales in the IT datacom market grew by a very strong 57% in US dollars and 56% organically as we benefited from strong demand for AI-related applications as well as growth in our non-AI IT datacom business. Looking ahead, we expect a further mid-single digit sequential increase in sales in the first quarter as investments in AI-related data centers continue to accelerate. We are more encouraged than ever by the company's position in the global IT datacom market. Our team continues to do an outstanding job securing future business on next-generation IT systems, particularly those enabling AI. This revolution in AI continues to create a unique opportunity for Amphenol given our leading high-speed and power interconnect products. And really whether high-speed power or fiber-optic, our products are critical components in these next-generation networks and this creates a continued long-term growth opportunity for Amphenol. Now turning to the broadband and the mobile networks markets, I just want to note that with the pending acquisition of the Andrew businesses from CommScope, that effective in the first quarter of 2025 and going forward, we will combine the broadband and mobile networks markets into one market that we will refer going forward to as the communications network market. The broadband market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter grew by 10% in US dollars and 11% in local currency and organic as demand from broadband operators improved. On a sequential basis, our sales increased by a very strong 14%, which was well ahead of our expectations for actually a high single-digit sales decline. For the full year 2024, sales in the broadband market were down by 11% in US dollars, local currency and organically, and that was driven really by a moderation in broadband operator spending. The mobile networks market represented 3% of our sales in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year 2024. Sales in the fourth quarter increased by prior year by a strong 25% in US dollars and local currency and 21% organically, as we benefited from increased spending by mobile network operators as well as wireless equipment manufacturers. Sequentially, our sales decreased by 4%, but this was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. And for the full year 2024, sales grew by 11% from prior year and 5% organically, and this was driven by a strengthening in the mobile networks market in particular in the second half of the year. So, now looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect the newly named communications networks market to see a mid-teens decline in sales from these strong fourth quarter levels. And as a reminder, this guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions that have not yet closed and therefore excludes the impact of the Andrew acquisition that we still expect to close in the first quarter. I would just say that we're very well-positioned with customers across the communications networks market, and we look forward to continuing to support our OEM and service provider customers in 2025 and beyond. Our teams around the world are working aggressively to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next-generation technologies and we look forward to the increased potential that comes from Amphenol's unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. As we look forward to welcoming the Andrew team to Amphenol, we remain poised to further build on our position as mobility technology innovation continues to accelerate. Now, turning to our outlook, and obviously, assuming the continuation of current market conditions as well as constant exchange rates, for the first quarter, we now expect sales in the range of $4 billion to $4.100 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. This guidance would represent sales growth for the first quarter -- or from the first quarter of 2024 of 23% to 26% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 23% to 28%. And I would just reiterate here that I remain confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to adapt to the many opportunities and challenges in the current environment and to continue to grow Amphenol's market position while driving sustainable and strong profitability over the long term. And finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our entire global team around the world for their truly outstanding efforts here in the fourth quarter and in the full year 2024. And with that, operator, we'd be happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer period will now begin. Please limit to one question per caller. Our first question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Your line is open. Luke Junk : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Adam speaking in late January only, certainly into New Year. Just be curious to hear what's your number one below the radar opportunity for Amphenol in '25? AI is much discussed, of course, as are the new CIT and pending Andrew acquisitions. But what about the below the radar opportunity either end market or operationally that you're excited about in the coming year? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Well, Luke, thank you very much. I mean, I would burn the next five hours if I started to talk about all of the little bits and bobs of opportunities that we faced, and so I'm going to punch a little bit on that. But just to tell you one thing, which is that we see across the company so much opportunity with the revolution of electronics. I was just a couple of weeks ago out in Las Vegas at the Consumer Electronics Show and I know for a lot of people going to CES is kind of a chore and they dread it. They spend their whole Christmas holiday dreading going on the first week of January to roam around the crowded aisleways of CES. For me, it's the most exciting thing on Earth to go. I think I burnt nearly 30,000 steps in one day, wandering the hallways, looking at this extraordinary array of what's going on in the world. And there was one thing that we see in our business and you saw on full display in Las Vegas, which is the real convergence of all of these things that have been going on, things like robotics, the next-generation vehicles and next-generation consumer devices, IoT and the like, and converging that with now this revolution in accelerated computing. And the combination of the device and product innovation with the acceleration of compute power that really is AI, for me, that's going to unlock opportunities across our industry that we never could have imagined before. And when I spent those 30,000 steps in my half day of walking the -- and burning out my shoe leather at CES, I just saw this over and over and over again. And so, I am really excited about that convergence and I'm really excited about what that's going to create, the unknown new industries that are going to come out of this accelerated compute and that convergence with the amazing developments around product technology that we as a company are enabling across all of our end markets. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Adam, if I can just ask you one on the [indiscernible] AI connectors, particularly and there's been a lot of news reports about the complexity of the connectors that you're manufacturing for these AI systems. I mean, if you can talk about the implications of the complexity increase that you're seeing there in terms of both market share for Amphenol and how that trends long term with the increasing complexity vis-a-vis sort of the need maybe for customers to look at some of the level of simplification over time and how does that sort of impact your content opportunity on a generation-to-generation basis? That will be helpful if you can talk about those drivers. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thanks very much, Samik. It was a little broken, but I think I got the gist of your question. Look, the complexity is a great thing for Amphenol and we've talked about this already a number of times with this advent and with the development and the acceleration of the investments in AI. But what is really unique about these systems is the fact that these chips, the processors have to all talk to each other to make the complex calculations and the probability calculations that ultimately creates a learning model or a neural network or machine-learning, whatever it is you want to call it and our products are an integral part of that connectivity of linking chips to chips and then linking them across the various devices in the data center. We -- is that complex? It is by definition, because the products have to all talk to each other. And so, then, it's a question of can we solve our customers' problems with the highest speed, lowest latency interconnects that enable those chips to talk to each other to make those calculations amongst themselves, and to do that using the lowest possible amount of energy, because I think nobody -- you cannot pick up an article about AI without also hearing in the same breadth about the challenges around the power supply for these networks as they're being built out. And the beauty of the products that we supply is they accomplish both. They are enabling the high speed, enabling the low latency, but also doing that with a much more significant reduction in power than you would get from certain other architectures. And for us, we're agnostic to how customers go about architecting these products as long as they continue to make investments broadly across the board in these new AI architectures, which just are by definition going to have a more intensive content of interconnect products for our industry and where Amphenol, we're confident we're going to gain more than our fair share of that opportunity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Adam, hoping you can just maybe talk a little bit more about the AI theme and maybe the part you can talk about is just the durability of growth you're seeing on the AI front will be helpful. I think $5 billion of orders is extremely impressive. Maybe you can just touch on what's the duration of this book? How does that convert to revenues? And then, really related to AI, you folks had a really nice shout out from NVIDIA on their earnings call recently. So clearly, you're working very closely with them. But typically when we see in your traditional smartphones or switches, everything else, your content typically goes up as you go from Gen 1 to Gen 2 to Gen 3. Would that hold true for AI as well, or is there something different here? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Amit and look, we are very pleased with the company's position on these next-generation systems and I've talked about the fact that we're working with really players up and down the stack from folks who are actually making the investments themselves in these data centers, all the way down to folks who are designing the chips and the systems around those chips and everything in between and we're really proud of our position and the breadth of our position. And I think the breadth of that position and the strength of our products is really a very durable position in as much as there is not a backwards trend in performance. Performance of these systems is a one-way ratchet. And as we continue to enable and push the limits of the performance of the programs, that further strengthens our position across that entire stack of the investment. Now, are we going to win 100% of everything? Of course not. I mean, we have great competitors and some of those competitors are actually our licensed partners in certain cases. But I would say that with Amphenol's leading position in high speed and power products, it puts us certainly in a position to gain more than our fair share of that. We're very pleased for any positive comments we get. I will continue my trend of not making any comments about any customers. But what I will say is that as our customers think about the generational shifts and the performance increases in their products, we will have a very prominent role with them in helping to enable those generational changes, whether they're looking for more performance, whether they're looking for more power efficiency, whether they're looking to embed more complexity into those systems, those are all areas where we are already deeply at the table in a real partnership with all of our customers as they push the limits of this very, very exciting revolution in AI. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the record profitability. Another question on AI, if I could, and you spoke a bit already around the very robust demand that the company is seeing. I am hoping to double-click a bit on the supply side, if I could please. And as Amphenol is shipping products to support next-gen AI servers and racks, can you comment more on how that ramp is going and whether or not Amphenol has encountered any yield or supply issues that may be gaining your ability to meet demand? And if there are any constraints, maybe you could share what the current status is? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Well, thanks very much, Mark. Appreciate your comments. I mean, look, when our customers choose Amphenol, they're doing this for a variety of reasons. They're doing it because we have the proverbial better mousetrap that our product has the capabilities and the abilities to satisfy the needs that they have and whether that's high-speed low-latency or more efficient power or the like. But they're also doing it because they have a -- that they have a kind of a confidence in the execution machine that our entrepreneurial organization has created. And let's -- if you step back for a moment and think about what makes our company special, it is really that decentralized entrepreneurial organization with nearly 140 general managers around the world who each have the full authority and accountability to tailor their individual businesses in such a way that they meet customer demands. We've talked for years about the unique ability of our team working in mobile devices to capture incremental opportunities when maybe our competitors fall down. And we did that again last quarter as you saw outperforming our expectations coming into the quarter. And I would just tell you that the wide array of folks working inside of Amphenol on these AI ramp-ups, which are very significant ramp-ups, there's no doubt about it. I mean, you have only to look at the public CapEx spending of some of the big companies who are outfitting these AI centers to know that these are very, very significant and not for the faint of heart. There is no doubt about it. Very challenging products, very challenging ramp-up schedules, but no question, our customers are always happy to work with Amphenol on that unique agility. Are we perfect at all times? Of course, we're not, but are we always there to react in real time to redirect resources to make whatever needs to happen, happen in support of our customers. No question about it. And that is at the end of the day the greatest value that we offer our customers is that unique Amphenolian entrepreneurship and the agility that comes there from. And I would tell you, I'm so proud, so proud of our team working on these just really momentous programs and how great of a job that they're doing so far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia [Technical Difficulty] Our next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. You may proceed. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thanks. If I can just about the industrial end market, I think Adam mentioned that demand trends are improving. So, if you could just double click on where you're seeing the end market improving the linearity of that improvement, that would be great. Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thank you very much, Asiya. And there seems to be some issue with some connectivity here, certainly not using Amphenol connectors. But if I understand your question, where are we seeing the improvements in industrial, and first, I would just comment that we're very pleased actually to have for the first, I think in seven quarters, organic growth in the industrial market growing [indiscernible] so bad in the quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, that growth would have been even better were it not for the fact that we continue to see an organic moderation of our sales in Europe. When I think about the markets that showed particular strength or the segments of the market that showed particular strength in the quarter, we're really pleased that we had good growth in areas like medical and rail mass transit, alternative energy and other areas that we saw good organic growth. And then, actually very encouraging that we saw very robust growth in our industrial instrumentation and that really does include everything from test equipment and things that go into, for example, semiconductor manufacturing where there was a little bit of a cycle in that semiconductor manufacturing. I think we're maybe on the other side of that cycle right now and starting to deliver growth. So, we're overall encouraged. I would say it's still too early to call a full recovery, especially because the kind of outlook of Europe remains in my mind very uncertain. But with the strength that we've seen in Asia and in North America, we come into 2025 for sure with a little bit of a better sense and a better sense of confidence than we did coming into 2024. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joe Spak : Thanks. And Adam, I'd recommend getting a good pair of sneakers for next year's CES to ease the strain on your feet a little bit. The Communication Solutions margins, they really expanded quite meaningfully over the past year or so. And I think that trajectory is pretty similar to when AI started picking up. So, can you just help us understand how we should sort of think about profitability here going forward? Is it sustainable? And is AI mix continues to go up? Margins should mix higher? Or are there some other things to consider whether it's more investment or I know you mentioned some higher CapEx to build that capacity and maybe that starts to reign in the margins a little bit? Thanks. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thanks a lot, Joe. Listen, we're really proud obviously of just the overall profitability of the company and certainly hitting the operating margin levels of 22.4% for the company is really something that we're again extremely proud of. As it relates to just the Communication Solutions division and their profitability, I mean, they grew -- that division certainly grew very significantly over the last year, driven by the IT datacom market and AI specifically. Not all of that is in that division, but certainly a good portion of it is. And when you have growth at that level, the conversion typically would be relatively strong. And it's not just related to AI specifically, it's just really related to the business' ability to really have strong discipline over fixed costs and really that drives the leverage in that business. I mean, if you look at the conversion in that division and that strong growth, it's probably in the low 30s, which is not abnormal for a growth rate, for a conversion rate. And when you grow as much as they did, you're clearly going to drive operating margin dollars and ultimately drive that percent higher. So, I would say that's really more driven by just the execution of the team, their ability to really drive -- control the fixed costs within the operations as they continue to grow, which is typical to the Amphenol agility and what we do. We drive the growth, but we always keep an eye on costs. And that's really what I think makes the company special and ultimately able to drive strong conversion margin when we continue to grow. So, really strong -- really happy with the profitability and -- but I wouldn't say this has anything specifically to do with our AI related business. It just really more relates to the growth and the real good discipline over cost. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Your line is open. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. Sorry about that. I think I got dropped there. I wanted to touch on hopefully not repeating any questions that were asked, but President Trump is now taking office. Want to get your take on what you guys are thinking and how you're planning for the year as it pertains to tariffs? And can you provide some details around percent of products coming from Mexico, Canada and China, just so we can try to gauge the risk ahead? Adam Norwitt : Yeah. Thank you very much and appreciate the question. Obviously, we're watching very carefully all that goes around the world -- all that's happening around the world and all of the places that we operate as a global company. Look, specific to tariffs, let me just say this. I mean, this is not a new topic. We dealt with tariffs back -- from the US back in, I think it was 2017. Those were -- tariffs were mostly directed to China, but not only at China. And I think what we saw in that time is our team did a fabulous job of mitigating the impact of those tariffs through a wide variety of measures. There was not a one size fits all solution. Underlying all of that is the backdrop that we tend to make our products in the regions where our customers buy them, not 100%, but that we tend to always try to be close to our customers, and sometimes our customers are making things in regions and shipping them into the US or into Europe and we try to be close to those customers wherever they're making them. But if you really get to the essence of why we were so successful in mitigating the last phase of tariffs, it comes down to that unique entrepreneurial organization that I mentioned earlier. The fact that we don't here at headquarters put out for everybody a mandate to say, \"Hey, there are tariffs coming, here's what you have to do. Here's step one, step two, step three,\" rather, what we do is we tell all of our general managers around the world that it's up to them to manage through anything that comes along and impacts their business, including trade policies, including tariffs, including whatever can come along. There's a whole host of different government policies that can ultimately bump into our company. And what that means is not that they kind of guess where the policy is going, but rather that they make sure that their operations are as agile as possible. And we run a company that's based on the principle of agility, of entrepreneurship, the flexibility, the reactivity. And that positions us extremely well when there are these kind of unpredictable situations that are coming. We're never going to front-run a policy and guess what policy, but we'll be right there ready to react if a policy does come about. And I can tell you that, we were very successful in mitigating any impact that came back in 2017 by having general managers who know their products, who know their competitors, know their customers, have full ability to manufacture their products wherever they need to do so, and to change the logistics if they need to do that. And I'm very confident that we'll be in the same position this time. And if anything, I would tell you that this time around, we're in an even better position, because since 2017, we've continued to expand the presence of our company, the manufacturing presence of our company around the world; new factories in Southeast Asia, new capabilities in South Asia, new capabilities in North America, in the US, in Mexico, in Eastern Europe, in North Africa, you name it. And we have around the world today nearly 300 facilities across more than 40 countries and we continue to expand so that we preserve that flexibility in the event that there are policies that come out that do impact us and our customers. And when those policies come out, we're first going to get together with our customers, we're going to see what's going on with them, what they want us to do, and then we're going to react accordingly in real time and faster than any other organization can do because of that unique entrepreneurial structure that we have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open. William Stein : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'll add my congratulations to the great results. I'm trying to skew away from AI and instead I want to ask yet another one about the industrial end market. Adam, you talked about some of the stronger areas. I wonder about industrial automation specifically. It's my recollection that may be more sort of Europe-focused, and therefore, I'm guessing it's not recovering. But in terms of industrial automation, are you seeing any improvement there and to the degree it's still weak as your sense that it's more demand related or inventory overhang related? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thanks very much, Will. I mean, look, double-clicking down into automation, you're very correct that industrial automation tends to be a more Europe-centric demand. It's not necessarily where the automation ends up, but there's no doubt that the companies that we work with, our customers who are creating these automation capabilities, they are more Europe-centric and they are still more impacted by the overall moderation in demand in Europe. I mean, so look, our sales in the Industrial Automation were down organically on a year-over-year basis. I would say though that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we saw a smidgen of growth in factory automation. I don't want to get ahead of my skis on that and tell you that that's a recovery or any other sign, but it is a data point. And so, we'll see. Look, I remain somewhat concerned about Europe with the exception that we've seen very, very strong performance in our defense and commercial air businesses in Europe. But anything related to industrial, and industrial by the way in Europe still has a strong linkage to the overall automotive industry, that I think the recovery and the timing of that recovery is yet to be really determined. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. So maybe building on some of the margin commentary, obviously saw some nice margin improvement, but you did highlight the dilutive impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Could you just update us on the integration of acquisitions and margin improvement there? And then, maybe how organic margins would have performed in the quarter? Thanks so much. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thanks, Saree. I appreciate the question. Yeah, we had obviously a really good quarter on the face of our conversion margins of kind of in the mid-20s conversion on a year-over-year basis and in the 30% sequential conversion we had going into the Q4. But as I did mention, as you point out, that really despite the acquisition and dilutive impact of acquisitions, we had those conversions. So, with the acquisitions, these conversion margins were even stronger. I wouldn't say sequentially so much because there's not such an acquisition impact sequentially, but really on a year-over-year basis. And obviously, the biggest acquisition on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter was CIT. We're not going to give specific margin information on CIT, but we certainly are very happy with their progress during the year. They're still under the company average margins, so they're still dilutive to the company in regards to our conversion, but certainly accretive on an EPS level and also from the perspective of progress on the margin line, we're happy with the progress they have made. The management team has been outstanding, and really just couldn't say really enough things positively about how happy we are with the CIT and the progress of that acquisition. But the margins do have a little bit more to go. This takes a little bit of time. And, but I think that at the end of the day, we're really optimistic that ultimately we'll get to those company average margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. Your line is open. Guy Hardwick : Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask a question about the defense business. Adam, if you could break it up a little bit as you did with industrial? What's driving the growth beyond just broadening improvement in military budgets? Are you in particular areas where there is unmanned systems or electronic warfare? Can you maybe talk about some of the drivers behind defense? Adam Norwitt : I mean, look, a little bit different from industrial. Our defense business, which had a very strong performance last quarter and for the full year, both growing by 9% organically. I would tell you that it's very broad based in defense. I mean, yes, are there different pockets which are a little higher growing than others like space, for example, anything related to space is growing really strong. Actually, we're seeing good strength in vehicles in particular in Europe, airframe growing very strong. But there's really communications growing strong both in the quarter and the year. But it's not as distinguished as it was in industrial where we're seeing a few markets which really offset other markets that remain more challenged like we mentioned to the answer to Will's question. So, I think broadly in defense, it is a question number one of increased investments by a variety of different countries, especially what we're seeing in Europe. And then, it's the redirection of that spending towards next-generation electronics broadly. And that's where Amphenol's position is really at such a premium because we participate in those next-generation electronics to a greater degree than we did in just the general overall military spending. And I think that's ultimately the equation that results in the strong performance that we saw last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yeah, thank you. Adam, there are a lot of moving pieces here in this AI supply chain, if I could go back to that topic. You had record orders, but your CapEx came down marginally. Your yields are very good, but ODM yields are low in these complex AI systems. Can you just help calibrate if investors should think that second half revenues in AI could moderate for Amphenol or what kind of visibility do you have into second-half growth versus first half especially given where you are with CapEx and perhaps your capacity matching with ODM ramps? Thank you. Adam Norwitt : Yeah, thanks very much, Wamsi. I mean, look, I'm not going to try to predict any of our markets past the guidance that we've given here in the first quarter. I would just tell you that our position for these AI buildouts is very robust. We're making significant investments as we've talked about. And yes, sure, in a given quarter, I mean, there can be a lumpiness to CapEx for a wide variety of reasons, when you order certain things, when you pay for certain things and the like. But I think the orders that we talked about, the very significant book-to-bill that we have in IT datacom, in particular, related to AI, and the broad array of design wins that we have with customers gives us a great long-term confidence without commenting on which quarter is going to be higher or lower next year, I think we've already given guidance about the first quarter that is unseasonably strong. I mean, typically, our first quarter in IT datacom would be down, I don't know, kind of low- to mid-single-digit decline from the fourth quarter, which is typical seasonality in IT datacom. And here we are guiding that up mid-single-digits, which is quite a differential for a market of that scale. And so, I think we come into 2025 with a very positive outlook. And as we go through the year, we'll try to give you a good sense of how we see that each quarter successively. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just on the auto markets and the mobile devices markets, it seems like you guys for the full year on an organic growth basis outgrew what were pretty flattish markets. I was just curious if you could sort of give us a report card on whether that's sort of par for the course now looking at those numbers or if there was something unusually positive or negative that helped or hurt your growth over market in those areas looking out into '25? All right, thanks. Adam Norwitt : Thanks so much, Steve, for the comment. I think you're correct. I mean, we've outperformed in both of those markets. And I would say that that's not a rarity for us in recent years. I mean, automotive, for example, I think we've outperformed for a number of years, whatever benchmark one wants to use. And I think, the underlying driver of automotive has always been for more than a decade, the expansion of electronics into cars and thereby the content opportunity that comes to us. And then, our ability to try to win more than our fair share of that content, whether it's in next-generation drive trains, next-generation electronics, safety, communications and the like. And relative to mobile devices, it really comes down to two things. One is our position with customers through the breadth of our antenna interconnect and mechanism offering and wide variety of products that we sell into that market, everything from unique antennas to complex interconnect products to mechanical hinges and the like. And then, our ability to execute when customers need us the most, and thereby to take a little more than our fair share of that overall business. And I think our team has demonstrated time and time again over, gosh, I'd say the whole of my 16 years so far as CEO, they've demonstrated that ability to execute. And our team is just a fabulous organization. They continue to have that agility that serves them so well in mobile devices. And look, every year is different. There's a different cadence. There's a lot of volatility. But I don't think there's something unique in 2024 rather than a continuation of what has allowed us to outperform for many years prior. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Scott Graham with Seaport Research. Your line is open. Scott Graham : Hey, thank you for squeezing me, and congratulations on a strong quarter. I also have a question on the auto market and hopefully, it's simple. With EV production well above certainly current and forecast ICE production over the next five years, does that reduce your market opportunity in auto? Adam Norwitt : We talked about the fact that EVs and ICE vehicles all have growing amounts of content. And when you get to an EV and you're converting things that were mechanical or hydraulic into electronic and electrical, that creates a great opportunity for our company. And I think we've done a fabulous job of capitalizing upon that opportunity around the world. And meanwhile, with ICE vehicles, to the extent that there is a tilt to or from EVs to ICE, there's no doubt that ICE vehicles will be built to also be more fuel efficient and electronics is a great driver of that fuel efficiency as well, new sensors, new interconnect products that go along with that. And the vast majority of our automotive business is actually agnostic to the drivetrain. And what it's not agnostic to is the expansion of electronics in the car. And so, I think today when you get a new car, and I know recently, we've been shopping for a new car for my mom, and you look at these new cars and, I mean, there's just a kind of flamboyant array of different electronics that you can get even for someone who is not used to so much electronics in their life like my mom would be. And it's amazing. I mean, it's just amazing. These are life-saving, life-changing electronics that are being embedded, even in the type of a car that my 75-year-old mom would want to drive. And so, I think the opportunity ahead of us in automotive remains very, very robust. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Norwitt for closing remarks. Adam Norwitt : Well, thank you so much, operator. And I want to extend again my thanks to all of you on the phone for your attention and support of the company, and we very much look forward to talking to everybody 90 days from now. Take care. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for attending today's conference, and have a nice day.",
