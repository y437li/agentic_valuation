My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, April 17, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our first quarter results. I am obviously happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $9.3 billion, net earnings $2 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.02 and our annualized return on common equity was 10.9%. The first quarter reinforced two consistent themes that we have seen over the past few years. First, the continued uncertainty around the strength of the global economic recovery; and second, the dominant role that central banks play in driving broad economic activity and capital market sentiment. With respect to the first, market participants struggle to reconcile mixed economic data across different regional economies that weigh the prospect of a strengthening U.S economy against an improved, but still relatively weak European economy and a slowing economy in Asia. As it relates to the second theme, discussions among market participants are also centered on the potential for additional central bank activity. In United States, the focus remain on the pace and potential magnitude of further tapering to the Federal Reserves bond buying program. In Europe, the market attempted to weigh the potential for either negative interest rates or the introduction of an asset purchasing program. In Asia, market participants questioned whether the upcoming hike in Japan's consumption tax would weaken positive momentum and require the Bank of Japan to boost its quantitative easing. Given the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for central bank activity, it is understandable that overall client sentimental risk appetite was subdued. With this backdrop, we are all reminded of the importance of a strong and diversified business. With respect to the client franchise at Goldman Sachs, we continue to see strong relative positioning and performance across all of our businesses. Within investment banking, we maintained our market leading position in completed M&A. We advised on 31 value transactions, valued at $1 billion or more, the highest number in the industry. We helped underwrite $55 billion in global equity offerings during the quarter, making us the market leader. We also helped to bring a $194 billion of high yield and investment grade debt offerings to market, which is a quarterly record for debt underwriting volume. Within investment management, total assets under supervision reached a record $1.08 trillion, up 12% over the past year. Despite market headwinds, our performance within FICC demonstrates the benefits of offering our clients a diversified product suite, meeting their needs across rates, credit, currencies, mortgages and commodities. Whether it's from a business, products or regional perspective, the value of diversity was reinforced in the first quarter of 2014. Now, I'll discuss each of our businesses. In investment banking, we produced first quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% from the fourth quarter. This was our highest quarterly performance since 2007. While investment banking backlog declined from yearend levels, it is up significantly compared to this time last year. First quarter advisory revenues were $682 million, up 17% sequentially. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Vodafone's $130 billion disposal of its U.S. group, whose principal asset is its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. Cole Real Estate Investments' $10.9 billion sale through American Realty Capital Properties and Bristol-Myers Squibb sale of its global diabetes business to AstraZeneca for up to $4.3 billion, plus future royalties. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter. These include Safeway's $9.2 billion sale to an investor group, led by Cerberus Capital Management, Hutchison Whampoa's $5.7 billion sale of a 25% stake in A.S. Watson to Temasek and Foster Wheeler's $2.9 billion sale to Amec. Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were $1.1 billion in the first quarter, down 3% compared to record fourth quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues of $437 million was 30% lower, as industry-wide activity declined in the first quarter, particularly for IPOs. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 29% sequentially to $660 million due to higher issuance activity in both investment grade and leverage finance markets. During the first quarter we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs. Whether it was McKesson's $5.5 billion bridge loan and $4.1 billion investment grade notes offering or Hong Kong Electric Investments' $3.1 billion IPO or X2 Resources' $2.5 billion private placement. Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses, net revenues were $4.4 billion in the first quarter, up 31% compared to the weaker fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were up 50% sequentially. Rates and mortgages were both up significantly relative to the weak forth quarter, although client activity and volatility remain relatively muted. Credit improved slightly and was supported by stable credit markets. Commodities revenues improved significantly relative to a weak fourth quarter, as market volatility and client activity increases. Currency was modestly lower sequentially. Equities includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were down 7% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues, up $416 million, were down significantly due to less favorable market condition in certain areas, including emerging markets in Asia, particularly Japan. Commissions and fees were $828 million, up 11% relative to the fourth quarter on solid cash volumes. Security services generated net revenues of $352 million, up 4% sequentially. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $82 million, roughly consistent with fourth quarter levels. Moving on to our investing and lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $702 million, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including divestitures and pending IPOs. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $597 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $230 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated investments. In investment management we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. Management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Incentive fees were largely driven by performance fee related to the sale of an investment. During the first quarter, assets under supervision increased $41 billion to a record $1.08 trillion. This growth was driven by record long-term net inflows of $40 billion, largely in fixed income assets. During the quarter, long-term net flows were strong across each of our client distribution channels, institutional, high net worth and third party. During the quarter, we also had market appreciation of $14 billion, largely in fixed income and equity assets. Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefit, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the accrual in the first quarter of 2013. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, 24% lower than the fourth quarter and down modestly from the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter included higher litigation and regulatory expenses, higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities. Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,600, down 1% from yearend 2013. Our effective tax rate was 32.7% for the first quarter. In terms of capital, there are a number of items to cover. First, during the quarter we repurchased 10.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.7 billion. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2013 capital plan. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve did not object to our revised 2014 proposed capital actions. With respect to our regulatory capital ratio, the Federal Reserve has approved the firm to come off the parallel run. And therefore, starting in the second quarter, our capital ratios are determined under the transitional provisions of Basel III. As a result, the transitional ratios are not only the most relevant, but also a better assessment of our risk-based capitalization. Our Basel III common equity Tier I ratio on a transitional basis was 11.3%, using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our transitional ratio was 10.9%. Risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach are approximately $600 billion, $355 billion in credit risk, $155 billion in market risk and $90 billion in operational risk. Let me make a few brief points on the supplementary leverage ratio. Given that the proposed rule hasn't been finalized and won't take effect until 2018, to date, we have not taken any significant actions. When we have a final rule, there are multiple options that we can pursue. On the capital side of the equation, our regulatory capital levels benefit from a natural tailwind over time as we comply with the Volcker Rule. As you know, we have investments and funds, where we invest alongside our clients. Under the Volcker Rule, we are required to significantly reduce our level of fund investments, which currently creates an approximately $9 billion capital reduction. With respect to the asset side of the equation, there are also steps we can take if needed. For example, as of yearend, we had over $260 billion of asset associated with secured client financing activities. These are generally lower-risk collateralized assets. We can ultimately decide if needed to reduce the lower returning portion within these balances. Regarding the new proposal, our best estimate today is 4.2%, including the capital impact of reducing our fund investments to comply with the Volcker Rule, we estimate it would be 4.7%. To sum it up, we feel confident about our ability to comply in advance of 2018, given the variety of actions that we can take. And we look forward to working with regulators to pursue the goal of enhanced safety and soundness, while continuing to serve our clients and support economic growth. Before I take questions, let me leave you with some closing thoughts. Our performance in the first quarter is reflective of the ongoing challenges facing the broader marketplace, as the global economy continues its slow recovery. This is being counterbalanced by the continued strength and diversity of our global client franchise. A sluggish, yet steady improvement in the global economy should drive greater confidence and the durability of the recovery. In response, we would anticipate that market sentiment would improve, which should ultimately drive from our client activity and greater risk appetite. And the management team, we're focused on two primary goals. First, to focus the bulk of our resources on serving our clients and in the process grow our single-most valuable asset, our global franchise. Our second goal is to take a disciplined approach to adjusting and reengineering our businesses, so that we are well-position to protect returns in the current environment, and more importantly maximize returns, when a more favorable environment emerges. Simply stated, the goal is to consistently provide superior results for you, our shareholders, across the cycle. Thank you again for dialing in. And now, I'm happy to answer your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : So taking a look at I&L and maybe we should only focus on the equity side because I think most of the debt in lending will stick. At last look there was about $20 billion in there, $16 billion of it private equity. And given that you reiterated the $9 billion of disallowed -- this is a question, sorry. I'm assuming that you had some realizations in the quarter, but market list still has you at the same level of equity. I'm going somewhere with this, because I'm curious to see how you go about winding that down and getting in Volcker compliance over the next couple years and what the backup plan is, if you don't sell it off? In other words, can you spin some off? Sorry for the long question. Harvey Schwartz : I understand. That's obviously an important question, Glenn, thanks. So I think the right way to think about the Volcker compliance is, if you look at the K, we roughly had at the end of 2013, $14 billion of investments in funds. Now, we're obviously coinvested with our clients in all those funds, and those funds are not just private equity, they are private equity, real estate, debt funds, et cetera. And the important thing is really to focus on the $14 billion now. Obviously, there is a process where we can apply for extensions for two years, which basically takes us out three years in terms of compliance. But just to size it for you, I think it worth breaking down the $14 billion. And so if you start with $14 billion, you can immediately take off $2 billion, what I'll refer to as permitted investments, that brings you down to $12 billion. And then, you can take off another billion that relates to investments in fund that we're already in a process of redeeming, hedge funds and credit funds, where we have the flexibility to manage our own time path there. And so that takes you down another billion bringing you to $11 billion. Now within the $11 billion, obviously, for several quarters we've being in a harvesting mode and within the $11 billion, $2.5 billion is already public, but there maybe restrictions on sale down, et cetera. So when you add up all that math, the $14 billion at the end of last year, brings you down sub-9. And so the sub-9 is the number, we really have to manage. And again, we're investing alongside our clients in these funds. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : Moving on just a clean-up question related to CCAR. Your plan wasn't objected too, you got tons of capital and you keep producing more, so all those are good things. I'm curious to see, why you think you were so far off from the Fed in both PP&R and R&R and RWA. And I'm not agreeing with the Fed's projections, it's just, you had the biggest distance to the Fed and I'm curious on how you decompose that knowing that you don't have all the answers just yet. Harvey Schwartz : So that's an important question. So we obviously submitted a plan that we thought was significantly stressful and you can see that in our year-over-year numbers. We don't -- as you know, the Federal Reserve by design has created a process that is not transparent. They've communicated that very clearly. So it's difficult for us at this stage to reconcile our results with the Federal Reserve's results. We'll obviously work with the Federal Reserve and the material they publish and we'll participate in their forums actively and we'll try and get better insights. I think an important takeaway here is, we certainly as a market participant, we're not encouraged necessarily to replicate their test. And so in the end they're regulator, we're the regulatee. And so if they see that their results are more severe than ours, it guides the process. And I think this window for modifying your capital actions, is a good part of the process, which we obviously participated in. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : And last one is you've been able to put up ROEs in 10%, 11% range in an environment that I think you all would describe maybe a 5 out of 10, overall. So with your cost take out and your share count shrinkage, I'm assuming do you feel like you could do better than that over the cycle. I'm not necessarily forcing you for a goal over the cycle, but just curious to get your thoughts on what you can do in a little bit better times? Harvey Schwartz : So over the last several years, as we talked about, we've been focused on a number of strategic initiatives, things like, obviously, growing our asset management business, and very focused as you know, on cost reduction and that really is strategically about building operating leverage into the business. As we've done that through this part of the cycle, we've done it with an eye on finding the right balance, and by balance I mean is, we're obviously running these businesses for years and decades. And so as we're getting more efficient in creating operating leverage, we need to make sure that we protect that franchise. And I think this quarter's results really showed that diversity and the strength that our franchise, whether you're look at investment banking, asset management et cetera. So I think we found that balance, the right balance so far. Now, if we were to get significant tailwinds and a pickup in activity, we're very confident that we would participate in that significantly. So there is a lot of operating leverage in the enterprise. And with respect to our ROE, again, on an absolute basis, it's not what we want to be able to produce for our shareholders. But on a relative basis, it looks pretty good. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Just going back to the Volcker on the equity exposure. So you went through, how do we should think about the $14 billion running-off over time and addressing that, but I guess how quickly and how big you rebuild the direct investment book that I think is still Volcker-compliant? Harvey Schwartz : So it's not as much about speed of rebuilding. And as you know, we've never approached capital deployment about speed. It will all be driven by opportunity set. So that's the way we think about all of our businesses. As capital will comes out of those funds, it can be redeployed and obviously can be redeployed anywhere or it can be return to the shareholders, if we don't think the opportunity set offers the best. So over time, this would be completely driven by the opportunity set. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : So if you had to take a guess, looking out, I don't know three, five years, does the overall equity book get back to about where it is here or I would think a little smaller, but maybe not a lot smaller? Harvey Schwartz : It'd be impossible for me to say. Again, there will be maybe opportunities that are more driven by the real estate cycle versus others. And I don't know, my crystal ball barely works for a week. It definitely doesn't work that well for three or five years. But I wish I had one that did. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : And then just on the comp ratio, looking out the rest of this year. I think last year you changed up a little bit. You kept it steady in the first half and then brought it down a little bit in 3Q, and brought it down again in 4Q. Just any comments on how you're thinking about the timing of phase-in of the comp ratio?? Harvey Schwartz : So as always, in this quarter, it's our best estimate for the year. And we'll evaluate it as we go through the year. And again, really the philosophy in compensation hasn't changed at Goldman Sachs since the day I got here. It's all going to be again the process driven by performance of the firm, and business units and the individuals, and obviously our management of expenses and the returns we want to provide to shareholders. But right now it's our best estimate. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Harvey, given all the debate around the cash equities market structure and the role of high-frequency trading, just curious to get your updated thoughts on transfer to electronic trading business, particularly the future of the Sigma X platform?. Harvey Schwartz : So we've been obviously an active market participant in the dialogue. Gary Cohn, as I'm sure you saw, published an op-ed several weeks ago. Our focus on the equity market structure isn't specifically around high-frequency trading necessarily. It's really about the fact that over the last 10-years plus, the market evolution, speed of execution has just gotten ahead of the market infrastructure and the market plumbing. And so we're very focused on working with all market participants and regulators to ensure that the market infrastructure catches up with the speed. And there is other things in Gary's op-ed that I will refer you to, but that's the primary message. With respect to our own Sigma X platform, I know there has been some things in news. We have no strategic plans for Sigma X at this stage. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Jut switching over to FICC. Just curious as to what happened to the credit business. Your commentary on a year-over-year decline, kind of contrast with peers while speaking to strength there? Harvey Schwartz : So obviously from a debt underwriting perspective, I know your question was specifically about credit, but from a debt underwriting perspective very strong quarter for us I think by any measure, breadth of transactions as I highlighted and certainly relative to opportunity in the marketplace. In terms of any one quarter and credit, I have no insight into the competitors. It's been like a reasonably solid quarter for us in credit, so there really are no major takeaways there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : First question. I think you gave like some updated numbers around SLR, and I just want to make sure I understand. I know before there was sort of that estimate of greater than 5, but the rules weren't finalized. I guess now you're just in, you got the finalized or mostly finalized rules 4.2, but if you got out of some of those funds you get to 4.7. And I just getting from 4.7 to above the 5, just if you could mention like some of the things, obviously there is earnings power, you mentioned some of the repo part of the business, but I just wanted to understand kind of what's the map in terms of getting there? Harvey Schwartz : So if I wasn't clear, let me just clarify. So the 5 wasn't that move to 4.2. The 4.2 was a reference to the proposal that just came out, which incorporates the larger denominator. And we've done, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've done nothing to mitigate that. And as you know, our strategic philosophy on proposed rules is to engage actively in the dialogue with the regulators, but more importantly, we really won't look to mitigate until we feel like we have visibility around the final rule. Because we just don't want to mitigate things, and quite frankly do them in error. So we have done nothing to mitigate it. The reason I highlight the natural tailwind, as I refer to it, is under the Volcker Rule, the $9 billion have to come out of funds. And that is a dollar-for-dollar capital deduction. So just standing still, we would move to 4.7. But we haven't specifically begun to articulate a strategy internally to get us to 5, but this gap is not material for us at this stage to be extremely focused on it. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, then, I guess when you combine the CCAR process and then with some of the other regulations like Volcker, there is obviously some constraint on payouts for everyone. When you think about the other opportunities, so investing in the business, making investments, but on the other hand managing the risk weighted asset side of the equation, are there starting to be more opportunities to invest versus payout? And as the economy improves, does that pick up? Just want to kind of get your sense on the balance there. Harvey Schwartz : That's a great question. I think the one word that you used that, I think should resonate for the whole marketplace, not just Goldman Sachs, is this notion of constraints. And so every firm will be managing to whatever constraint they perceive. Within that really how do you fundamentally manage your capital? And at this particular stage, we're not feeling constrained. Obviously the 11.3%, Basal III ratio I referenced gives you some sense of potential excess capital. I think that this, it's an important industry discussion, because obviously for Goldman Sachs, but again the broader industry, the first priority is always about safety and soundness and adequate capital. But I do think that the flip side is there is a risk to excess capital in the system. And what we're doing is no different than we would have done in the past, if there is periods where we're running with excess capital, we're going to be patient and disciplined and wait for opportunities. And certainly we're in a position today where from a liquidity and capital perspective if there is demand from our clients, we can meet them. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then last one. Just on the fixed side of the business, you comment a lot on the quarter-over-quarter. When we look at year-over-year, and you have given that, at least on the OTC side you've gotten your clearing kind of in place and you were starting on the electronic side or the self-side. Just wanted to get your sense, I know it's difficult to piece those changes versus the broad environment given a lot of the volatility and the uncertainty out there. But maybe just from client conversations, how that's progressing and where you see that pan out? Harvey Schwartz : I think if you look back over the past year, I think clearing certainly manage by the marketplace and the regulators extremely well. I know there were lot of concerns going into it, but I think the multistage launch, really I have to give everybody high marks for that. Swap execution facility is now up and running, still relatively new, so a bit early to tell, but at this stage, really no significant impact in the marketplace. And again, we'll watch it evolve and its impact with market structure, but really nothing to discern at this stage of any materiality. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Can you talk more about the non-comp expense? I know that's been a focus of your, and it certainly came down a lot, how sticky is that decline? Harvey Schwartz : So at this stage, Mike, as you know, several years ago, we launched the cost reduction initiatives. And so that was a series of steps, which brought us up to just under $2 billion. At this stage we're still being at the margin, very focused on costs throughout the entire system. And so the sequential decline, as you know was obviously litigation. So that's not the mover, but the focus really is about again keeping cost significantly subdued during this part of the cycle, and again at the same time positioning us for an upturn. Mike Mayo - CLSA: So are you still looking to have these non-comp expenses decline down year-over-year? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. As I said, at the margin, we're very focused on expenses in this part of the cycle and in areas where we can get positive results, you should see them. Mike Mayo - CLSA: A separate question, the 2% buybacks were nice, perhaps you could do even more. And the threshold for the SLR is $700 billion in assets. And I guess you're above $900 billion. But is there any scenario where you would say, let's reduce our assets to below $700 billion, so there is less regulatory burden on the firm? Harvey Schwartz : No. There's no plans strategically to shift the size of the balance sheet in any way to get underneath some regulatory threshold. However, there is tactical things we can certainly do with the balance sheet, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which gives us some flexibility. And I think, for example, for any market participant if balance sheet becomes a constraint, I think there are elements of the balance sheet that either can be repriced as we move through the cycle or can certainly get smaller. Mike Mayo - CLSA: I've asked this question on several calls, but do you have any published financial targets as of right now? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, Mike, and I always appreciate your focus on this. There is no targeted ROE. And as I said earlier, at this stage, what we're really doing is strategically finding the balance point with this part of the cycle to make sure that we position the firm for growth, we provide you, the shareholders, with adequate and hopefully superior relative returns. And in the future, we're going to look to take advantage of all the market opportunities as the cycle improves. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Well, as a key, should I be looking at the proxy? I'm looking at Page 38 of the proxy, and you have the long-term incentive plan and that's based on ROE and growth in book value per share. So should I take that as an indication of what you're most focused on? But then on Page 33, I guess the Compensation Committee reviews results of Goldman versus peers, and it's a laundry list of ROE, EPS, earnings, revenues, comp ratio, non-comp expenses, a couple of other items. So what are you most focused on, if I'm looking at financial metrics? Harvey Schwartz : So any day of the week, as a firm, we're most focused on serving our clients and growing our activity levels. In terms of aggregate financial metrics, all the things that you'll see in the proxy, whether its book value per share, ROE, those are all components into the compensation methodology, as are those other things that are mentioned in the proxy, whether it's our focus on expenses and aggregate performance, but those are part of our long-term incentive plan. I wouldn't view those as specific metrics as it relates to how we think about our capital. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Lastly, at what point do you think you have enough clarity to be able to give us financial targets? Harvey Schwartz : I think, Mike, that we'll continue to communicate our message in a way that we think is appropriate for the context. Right now, obviously, there's still a significant amount of runway in finalization of rules. And as we get more clarity, we will continue to communicate with you how we think about capital. But I'm not sure necessarily having a published target is necessarily the best way to think about how we're managing the franchise, but we'll continue the dialogue, I'm sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : A couple of ticky-tacky questions. One is on the I&L revenue line. I was just wondering if you can give a little more color around how much was driven from the monetization of the investments. And you're basically looking to understand how that contributed to the higher incentive fees in the investment management? Harvey Schwartz : So the equity line was driven by a portion of the portfolio, which as I referred to as divestitures and IPOs. And the deadline is really investment-related gains and interest income. And obviously to some extent, you'll see it in the broader market this is a solid harvesting environment. And so you're seeing us do that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And did it have any implication for the incentive fees in investment management or not? Harvey Schwartz : As I said, the incentive fees this quarter, obviously largely influenced by a single asset that was sold. Again, I would put them more in the bucket of it's a harvesting environment. And so if we have performance, you're going to continue to see incentive fees. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then the $8.5 billion that you're going to be managing down over time, I mean your clients went into these funds with an expectation of typically 10-ish years or so. But you're not beholding to that timeframe if obviously there's opportunities to extract value early? Harvey Schwartz : So a number of these are older vintage funds. Obviously, we had some visibility on the Volcker Rule, when it was first launched. And so we have obligations to our clients. But again, we'll work with the regulators and continue to harvest the funds in the profile that I gave you. The clients obviously value these returns. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then just on the Basel III, the transitional numbers we got. I'm just wondering if you can you give us a sense of what your fully phased-in number is, since that's what we've been looking at for a while? Harvey Schwartz : 9.7 on the fully phased-in. But I would remind you again that we have to have the capital coming out of the Volcker funds. And so the transitional measure is maybe the best indicator. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then that 9.7 is standardized or advanced? Harvey Schwartz : 9.7 was advanced, I thought that that you're asking about, and standardized is 9.3. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then just lastly on the SLR. You walked through how the Volcker is going to be benefited? Can you give us a sense of how the CCAR would benefit as well? Harvey Schwartz : I think around Goldman Sachs, now we refer to that as CCAR by the way, but I'm not sure that's in the marketplace yet. So we've looked and if we've studied it at the margin, it could in the neighborhood of 10 or 15 basis points. But we're still digging through the details of that. But it's a tailwind too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : So it just a follow-up on the last question. So you gave us fully-phased. The 4.2 on SLR, that's a transitional, is that correct? Harvey Schwartz : No. That would be a fully phased-in, if you will. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And the increase to 4.7 would just be completely static if you were out of the $9 billion or sold funds today without any other change? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. We stand still. We do nothing. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And then you'd to add that 10 to 15 bps for the CCAR potentially just on top of that? Harvey Schwartz : Look again, early days on the CCAR -- and by the way, I'm glad you've adopted the CCAR acronym already. The early days, I think studying the CCAR, so that's why I didn't mention it earlier. But obviously I'm happy to give you a range on it. But the $9 billion that comes out, that comes out. CCAR is obviously a tailwind too. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : I just wanted to make sure that we sort of put them all in one place and then it was clear that they're all in the same basis? Harvey Schwartz : That's correct. And that would give you 4.8 or 4.85, if you will. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Moving back to FICC, I know you don't usually disaggregate, but it would be helpful maybe this time around, because we've seen such diversity of results among some of the different players. If you could give us some color on a year-over-year basis on the divergence that you saw between macro businesses like rates and FX versus credit and commodities, and the more numbers you can help us with, the better? Harvey Schwartz : I think the takeaway from the FICC business this quarter is really given them the market backdrop we had, where sentiment was really fluctuating. We had concerns about Asia growth and then political events. I think it really reinforces that if you're going to be in these businesses, you really need the diversification. And so as we mentioned, the quarter was helped by commodities, because we have a strong commodities business and you saw in certain segments, really unusually strong volatility. So we had opportunities to work with our clients. We just don't look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at in a multi-quarter basis. And in this particular quarter, you saw us outperform. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And just a follow-up question on the commodities. Was that mostly within the energy complex, where you saw the greatest strength? Harvey Schwartz : So that's where the primary volatility was. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: You flagged in the release, the investment banking pipeline, the backlog was down, which is a first time I remember as anyone doing that in a long time. And I'm curious, is that just because of the underwriting calendar or do you sense that M&A is also kind of out of peak and backing off? Harvey Schwartz : No, it was down. That shouldn't be a surprise. You may remember, Chris, that backlog had hit a post-crises high in the third quarter, then it hit another post-crises high in the fourth quarter. And obviously, the fourth quarter tends to be more of the build quarter and then coming-off of relatively strong quarter, and it wasn't down significantly towards yearend. I think more importantly, I've made two observations. One that's specific about the backlog, which I mentioned is up significantly versus the first quarter of last year. But I think the takeaway on M&A is an important one. We've now seen a couple of quarters with higher M&A notional volumes. And so these things can all change quite quickly, but right now it does feel like it's an environment where we're far enough away from the epicenter of the crisis, where CEO competence is at a point where strategic transactions are occurring and there is an important takeaway about the nature of the transaction, which is some of them are very large. And when you have a large transaction environment, I referred to the 31 transactions we did in excess of $1 billion a quarter. Large transactions can have, they won't always, but they can have a catalytic effect, either on the industry or they create subsequent transactions themselves. So again, it could all change on a dime. But right now this trajectory for merger activity feels pretty good. And obviously, over time that feeds a lot of other activity. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: I guess, that's what I was getting at. Everybody is looking for an M&A cycle. And in your view, it's alive and well and that's not the reason for the decline in the backlog? Harvey Schwartz : No. The level of engagement and conversation is quite good. And then again, look, again I referred to my crystal ball earlier not being great, but right now it feels pretty good. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: And then switching gears, the easiest line of your income statement to predict a last couple of years has been the investment management business, because the AUM was always $850 billion and there was always a $1 billion base management fees, I think going all the way back to 2008. And all of a sudden, we're seeing a significant amount of inflows and AUM are up nicely two quarters in a row, what's happening there? And what should we expect? And what's different? Harvey Schwartz : We've articulated this in the past. Obviously, this has been a strategic growth area for us. And it really has been about, it's a bit old fashion, but it's been focused on performance, delivering for our clients and having differentiated performance. And when you look at our historical multiyear numbers, it looked like strong. And so you're really starting to see the inflows. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer: Nothing beyond that? Harvey Schwartz : Because there has been some small bolt-on acquisitions, which were disclosed, but this is really the core drivers' performance, particularly in fixed income this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura: So Harvey, you made a very interesting point regarding the SLR tailwind from the sale of Volcker assets. Looking at the metrics and where they stand today, assuming that SLR will remain binding, the elimination of the disallowed assets will provide a meaningful boost to the numerator, which will help both your risk and SLR ratios. However, the capital relief from any additional shrinkage in I&L, I presume it will impact the denominator exclusively, which if SLR is binding actually incentivizes as you're engaging more risk intensive activities. So should we expect that you'll boost your permissible I&L investments as you optimize the ROE opportunity that you currently see based on the capital constrains as they stand today? Harvey Schwartz : I think we should be really clear on this. In no way shape or form are we going to let the regulatory guidelines or ratios or constraints encourage us to change our risk taking philosophy or how we deploy our capital. I can't underscore that more strongly. We often make mistakes and we're far from perfect, but as a firm, our risk culture focused on mark-to-market and our philosophy has served us well. And we're certainly, as I said, not going to be influenced by metrics that would maybe encourage risk taking. Quite frankly, we would always rather deploy this capital into our franchise businesses and we'll do that as opportunities present themselves. Steven Chubak - Nomura: And just one more from me. The Fed in ANPR published earlier this year, suggested that it would consider imposing some tougher restrictions on merchant banking activities, whether via more punitive capital requirements, restrictions on holding periods, what have you. I recognize this is really in the very early stages, but can you help us think about how your business or the merchant banking operation could adapt if tougher restrictions are imposed? And what level of I&L assets would be classified as merchant banking x those, which are disallowed under Volcker? Really just trying to identify what could potentially be exposed? Harvey Schwartz : It's very early in that process. And so I have no discrete insights for you. We'll obviously participate and have participated in the Federal Reserve's AMPR and it will be an evolving process. Again, I think the fundamental takeaway for you to consider and the way we approach these things, is if needed, if you had outcome that restricted our abilities, we would weigh that outcome and our ability to drive value for that capital. And if we felt, we couldn't drive value for that capital, then we would look to return it to the shareholders. I think it's that simple. You've seen it too before in things like our insurance business in Europe and our reinsurance business in United States, and that's the length that will evaluate all of our capital opportunities. But, obviously, we'll discuss this as we get more clarity. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Coming back to the commodities, solid results for this quarter, certainly encouraging. Maybe can you talk about your commitment to the physical side of the business and whether or not you think that a regulatory surcharge on that business could make it still economically viable for you all? Harvey Schwartz : It all depends, obviously, on the outcome. We don't have any visibility into the outcome. But again, it will depend on whether or not regulatory constraint is too high bar. I think more importantly today, as you know, we have a long history in the commodity business, providing our clients corporate treasurers and asset managers around the globe with hedging solutions and access to the marketplace and liquidity, not unlike we do in the corporate bond market. And separately, we feel we provide value in providing debt and equity capital to the investing side of the business. But it will evolve over time and we'll adjust accordingly. But it's a bit of a wait and see. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Have you seen any impact in that market as some high profile editors have announced plans to exit or sell or what have you? Harvey Schwartz : This is an important business to us, because it's important to our clients. I don't want to read through too much of this, because it's only one quarter and I think it's hard to extrapolate anything from a quarter. But certainly in commodities this quarter, in certain sectors, the feedback we're getting from clients is that, there may be, and again I have very limited visibility into our competitors businesses, but there just maybe some benefit to those market participants that stay strong in commodities like us, by those that are deemphasizing or exiting, particularly when the market is volatile. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Can you speak to trends of MD and partner headcount over the last few years maybe across the firm and by division? Harvey Schwartz : Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we've been very focused on cost. We continue to drive efficiencies throughout the organization, in terms of non-comp expenses and obviously also in people. But I don't really have any specific color for you, in terms of by division, et cetera. Obviously, we're managing those resources in the context of the business activity that the businesses are seeing. Brennan Hawken - UBS: I was just trying to get a sense, the shift to a more pyramid structure that you guys have referenced in the past. Harvey Schwartz : This is a partner year for us. So it's been two years since we made partners. And so obviously, we'll be grinding the entire organization through that process this year. Brennan Hawken - UBS: And then the last one, just sort of in reference to this $9 billion that you've chatted, where we discussed a bunch here and the dollar-for-dollar capital hit in I&L. Does your experience this year in sort of [indiscernible], which I certainly recognize as positive, trying to shrink the equity base? But does that make you a bit nervous about potential friction in returning that capital and the possibility of trapped capital for a while here as I&L shrinks? Harvey Schwartz : It doesn't. This year, again, there was a difference in outcome between our results and the Federal Reserves results. We obviously thought we submitted a severe test and the outcome was more severe. Again, I think this process of giving firm the opportunity to adjust, I think it's a good one and it provides us in the marketplace all the flexibility. So again, I have to believe, again, in my opinion only, so discount it as you will. I have to believe, we'll be able to return excess capital over time for the exact reason that excess capital on a sustained basis for any industry, I don't think is a healthy thing. But again, that's just my opinion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Just two quick ones. You obviously spent some time today talking about the ratio at the holding company. Just curious if you could update us on the SLR ratio at the bank level, if that's materially changed from or materially different from what you were talking about maybe a quarter ago? Harvey Schwartz : So, again, I think what we should just do for the purpose of this conversation is, ignore the last quarter and I'll just focus on the supplementary proposal that's out there, because I think the proposal is probably more relevant for your work. And that number in the bank would be 56. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : And are there any other mitigating actions you can take within the bank relative to what you talked about in the holding company? Harvey Schwartz : I haven't focused on it. But obviously, there are lots of things that go into the supplementary leverage ratio. So it's not a primary concern. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : And then you mentioned, and I'm sorry, if I missed it, but you mentioned in the equities trading side of things, the particular strength in cash in the first quarter. I guess I'm just curious if you could give us some color in terms of the trends in the equities derivatives and PB businesses? Harvey Schwartz : You can't really read anything, I don't think into one individual quarter. But I think that this quarter in particular was probably in some respects tougher for our client-base than the headline indices would read just in terms of their ability to drive performance. But again, the equity business, to be a leading player, you really have to be strong in all facets of it, which means the prime brokerage business, you have to have a strong research footprint, you have to be able to drive IPOs and secondaries, and obviously you got to be able to commit capital, that's very important, and obviously you have to have a huge commitment of technology. And so, right now we feel quite good about things. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : But in terms of the client activity levels or risk appetite, it sounded like that was a little bit lower than maybe the headlines would have suggested across your non-cash equities businesses? Harvey Schwartz : So if you look at our commissions and fees line, you can see it's up year-over-year and sequentially. But I would say, again, for certain segments of the client, client-based asset management, in particular for example and some of the headwinds, I think it was a tougher quarter for them. But I haven't studied all the full results. That's what I would expect to see. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : So since there are on more questions, on behalf of the team, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see you in the coming months. If there are any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. And otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's Goldman Sachs first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 15, 2014. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculations of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey M. Schwartz: Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our second quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $9.1 billion; net earnings, $2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.10; and our annualized return on common equity was 10.9%. The operating environment for our businesses was mixed during the second quarter, with favorable stable conditions in certain businesses and headwinds in others. It was an environment that, in the end, reinforced the benefits of a global, diversified business and a strong client franchise. All of this helped position the firm to continue to generate strong relative returns. Over the course of the second quarter, there was a lot of focus across the industry on the challenges facing market-making businesses. Most importantly, how an environment defined by low volatility weighed on client activity and risk appetite. Given how much has already been discussed on the subject, I won't go through the statistics. Suffice it to say in several markets, volatility is at historically low levels. During the quarter, we continued to see an increase in CEO confidence and a significant pickup in M&A activity. Year-to-date, announced M&A is up more than 70% to $1.8 trillion for the industry. It is nearly double that rate for our firm. Historically, increased M&A activity has been a favorable sign for a few reasons. First, it traditionally coincides with a positive trend in economic activity and client sentiment. Second, it generally translates into greater client activity, for example, currency, interest rate or commodity hedging. During the second quarter, financing markets also remained strong, driving our clients' demand for debt and equity underwriting services. As you would expect, rising asset prices created a favorable environment for our equity and debt investments. The quality of the underlying portfolio and favorable markets have also helped drive 8 straight quarters of strong Investing & Lending revenue performance. And finally, continued success in growing and preserving our clients' wealth has driven solid net asset flows within our Investment Management business. I'll talk more about this later, but it's important to note that assets under supervision reached another record this quarter, finishing at $1.14 trillion. So while Institutional Client Services is currently facing a lower level of client activity, our other businesses are seeing significant demand for our services. In a mixed operating environment, it's all about being diversified and staying close to our clients. Historically, this has been critical to generating superior returns. It's as relevant today as ever. Now let me take you through each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, flat with the first quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog increased during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. As you would expect, advisory activity was a significant driver of the increase. Second quarter advisory revenues were $506 million, down 26% from a strong first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Sallie Mae's $7.2 billion spinoff of its education loan management business and Illinois Tool Works' $3.2 billion sale of its industrial packaging segment to The Carlyle Group. While the reduction in completed transactions quarter-over-quarter contributed to the sequential decline in revenues, we experienced a significant increase in announced M&A, which should benefit future quarters and is reflected in the growth of our backlog. For example, we're advising on DirecTV's $67.1 billion sale to AT&T, Covidien's $42.9 billion sale to Medtronic and Holcim's combined EUR 40 billion merger with Lafarge. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were a record $1.3 billion in the second quarter, up 16% compared to the first quarter results, with significant strength in Europe. Equity underwriting revenues of $545 million were 25% higher, as industry-wide activity increased in the second quarter across IPOs and secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues increased 11% sequentially to a record $730 million due to issuance activity in the high-yield market, particularly merger-related activity. During the second quarter, we were committed to meeting our clients' diverse financing needs, whether it was Apple's $12 billion investment-grade offering, the AUD 2.3 billion financing of Transurban Group's acquisition of Queensland Motorways or B&M Value Retail's GBP 1.1 billion IPO. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.8 billion in the second quarter, down 14% compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Excluding DVA, net revenues were down 22% sequentially, reflecting reduced levels of client activity during the quarter. Currencies was higher sequentially, although volatility in volumes remained relatively low. Mortgages was roughly flat, while credit decreased modestly. Interest rates declined compared to the seasonally stronger first quarter. Commodities revenues declined significantly, following a robust first quarter as volatility in client activity decreased. Total net revenues for Equities in the second quarter were $1.6 billion. Excluding DVA, results were up 2% sequentially. Equities Client Execution net revenues of $483 million for the second quarter were up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Commissions and fees were $751 million, down 9% relative to the first quarter on weaker volumes. Securities services generated net revenues of $373 million, up 6% sequentially due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down 6% relative to the first quarter, mostly due to lower equity VaR. The overall decline was driven by both lower levels of volatility and risk. Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific events, including financings, as well as divestitures. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $604 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments and net interest income. Other revenues of $215 million include revenues from the firm's consolidated investments. In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially to a record $1.2 billion, reflecting the increase of assets under supervision. Following a large performance fee in the first quarter, incentive fees were down quarter-over-quarter. During the second quarter, assets under supervision increased $59 billion to a record $1.14 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of $21 billion into fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $23 billion, principally in equity and fixed income assets. Let me provide you with some detail on our Investment Management business. There are a couple of current themes that are really important to our clients. First, clients are concerned about the potential for rising interest rates. As a result, we saw institutional, private wealth and retail clients seek unconstrained fixed income strategies. Second, our clients are focused on outsourcing portfolio management functions to both create greater efficiencies and focus on their core competencies. They are also engaging us as an advisor to gain expertise and enhance their decision-making around asset allocation, portfolio manager selection and risk management. The demand for an outsourced asset management function and advisory services, particularly for our insurance clients, also contributed to net inflows for the quarter. Additionally, many clients have been looking for other opportunities to generate incremental yield and uncorrelated returns in their portfolios. As a result, we saw continued net inflows into our yield-focused strategies, as well as our liquid alternatives funds. And finally, clients have a continuing demand for defined contribution retirement solutions. We have been focused on growing our defined contribution product offering. To that end, we completed the acquisition of Deutsche Bank's Stable Value business, which contributed $11 billion of inflows this quarter. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 43%, which is consistent with the accrual for the first half of 2013. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, up 4% sequentially due to higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 32,400, down 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 30.3% year-to-date. The lower rate this quarter was driven by earnings that were permanently reinvested abroad, as well as changes in the earnings mix. Moving to capital. As I mentioned on our last conference call, the Federal Reserve approved the firm coming off the parallel run, and therefore, starting this quarter, our capital ratios are subject to the transitional provisions of Basel III. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.4% using the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach, our ratio was 10.9%. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion. Now I'd like to spend some time on our balance sheet. Over the past few months, we have received greater clarity on the role of the balance sheet across a variety of regulatory requirements, most notably CCAR and the supplementary leverage ratio. During the quarter, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of our balance sheet. We began the process by examining the return on asset characteristics associated with different businesses. Through that analysis, we identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings potential. As you would expect, the quarterly reduction largely impacted lower-return asset activities within our matched book and other secured financing transactions. By managing our balance sheet, we've achieved a number of benefits : first, we responded proactively to comply with regulatory developments; second, we improved the overall efficiency of our balance sheet, and third, we positioned the firm to provide additional risk capacity to our clients if needed. Going forward, we will continue to assess our positioning to ensure that we comply with new regulations and remain prudent allocators of an increasingly important financial resource. In closing, our management of the balance sheet is just one recent example of our firm's mindset and our broader culture of adjusting to a changing environment. In the past, you've heard us use the words adaptable and nimble. While adapting to an evolving backdrop is simple in concept, it can be difficult to implement. Successful implementation requires many things. It requires a culture of collaboration. It requires a talented and dedicated team, and you have to provide them with the necessary tools and analytics to make prudent risk-return decisions. However, the most important factor is our connectivity with our clients. Their needs ultimately inform our actions. Adaptability has always been important for our industry. However, it may be even more valuable in the current environment, given the numerous regulatory and economic changes underfoot. We do know that regardless of the environment, adaptability has been and will continue to be an essential ingredient to serving our clients and producing superior returns for our shareholders. Thanks again for dialing in, and now I'm happy to answer any of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : First question is a follow-up on your comments on the balance sheet reduction. I'm just curious for any type of example of a low-ROA business that doesn't have a broader client implication that's helping reduce the gross balance sheet. I'm assuming it's something in repo land, but just more interested in learning. Harvey M. Schwartz: Glenn, thanks for dialing in. So as I said, we started this exercise as we got basically increasing feedback on role, effectively, that balance sheet was going to play. And one of the significant inputs into the process, obviously, was CCAR. And so the way we approached it and one of the good things about working with the balance sheet is this notion, and I'm oversimplifying it, but you can effectively sort your balance sheet by return on asset, low to high. Now that doesn't mean necessarily that all low-ROA activities can be taken down. But in this case, it seemed like we had some opportunities that, as I said, would allow us to comply with the rules and give us a lot more flexibility. One example would be the matched book, which, of the $56 billion reduction in the quarter, came down $25 billion approximately. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, I get that. Maybe we could switch over to I&L for a second, and you mentioned the results have been great now for 8 quarters. I'm curious on the double-edged sword of the markets continuing to do better and the environment's good, produces good revenues, but we still have that little shadow hanging over us. It's a good shadow, but $9 billion or so in Goldman capital in the Investing & Lending function that eventually has to work its way out. Good environment to work its way out, but I don't know if you could provide any update on the asset side of what's in equity, debt and lending buckets, how much of the $9 billion you've worked through and maybe if you're working towards July of '15 or July '17, because I know we don't know those rules yet. Harvey M. Schwartz: So it's a great question. So in terms of how we think about the process in terms of complying with the rule, first, let me remind you, this capital, obviously, sits alongside our clients, in funds that our clients are co-investing with us in. So we're harvesting it at a pace that obviously makes sense for those funds and the performance associated with those funds. I won't go through all the numbers, because they haven't moved so materially since the last time I gave you an update. But on the last call, when I walked you through basically a waterfall of flows, the number ended up being roughly $9 billion. Now that was based on the January numbers. If you look at kind of midyear, we're at an $8 billion number now, give or take. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the no big change is just a function of markets keep moving higher, so your assets grow with it. So you sell some, but it goes off. Okay, I got that. Harvey M. Schwartz: So I mean, with respect to the capital, the reality is that as it comes off, we have the flexibility deploying that capital in any way that we think is in the best interest of our clients and the firm, or obviously, we can look to return it. And that will be opportunity-driven in the franchise. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, and I've noticed some direct investments being made. That's cool. Last 2 are quickies. One, what was the SLR ratio, and two, what's the geography of the market gain? Like what line item did it go through? Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of the SLR ratio, on the last call, we were at 4.3%, and then you have to make some adjustments. During the course of the quarter, you probably saw that we issued $2 billion in preferred. That adds 10 basis points to the ratio. That gets you to 4.4%. Balance sheet and other basic actions we took during the quarter gets you up to 4.5%. And again, an important fact on this is the one you mentioned earlier. As the capital comes out of the funds, which is punitive from the standpoint of the significant financial institutions deduction, that has to come out, obviously, before you have to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio in 2018. When you do that math, we're north of 5%. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. Cool. And the last cleanup was just the geography of the market gain. Harvey M. Schwartz: So as you know, we keep all those items in our Investing & Lending section. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay, in Equities? Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First one on, just the optimization of the balance sheet. So I understand a lot of the commentary. I guess, can you provide any color on maybe the return impact to the overall firm or what the returns were in the areas that you're exiting? And when you look at the broader balance sheet and given the current relationships and the activity levels, is there much more to do, or was this the bulk of it and you'll just keep an eye on it going forward? Harvey M. Schwartz: So as I said, the impact, de minimis, and that has a lot to do with how we approach this. So at the beginning of the quarter, when we began this exercise, as a management team, we didn't pick $860 billion as a hard-line target. This is a very iterative process that we go through. We set multiple targets. And just to give you a real sense, our initial target, we basically said, look, let's work down to an $875 billion level. And as we went through it, we realized that there was more capacity in terms of our ability to build in efficiencies and still work with clients and really no impact at the margin. But importantly, as I said before, this allows us to comply with the rules. And again, builds in flexibility in terms of how we deploy capital. In terms of how we go forward, our process will continue the same way. There won't be hard targets to get down, and we'll just continue to reassess. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just on the Investing & Lending segment. So Glenn hit on the capital side, I think it's obviously a hard business to predict, and so maybe ex the mark-to-market gains that we all try to predict, but can you give us any color on like the current MOC [ph] or the IRR of the portfolio, the seasoning, like normal exit premiums? Just anything to get a sense on how things are doing and what we can expect over the next couple of years as you're running it down or exiting those positions. Harvey M. Schwartz: So I mean, just for clarity purposes, obviously, the debt line has interest income in it. The equity line has equity positions. To give you some sense of how we look at it in terms of the underlying quality of the portfolio, if you look at the performance in the equity line this quarter, give or take, about 2/3 of the performance was driven by IPOs, other event-related activity in terms of the quarter. And so what you're seeing is the strength of the portfolio as we work through it. In terms of predicting the pace, obviously, some of that is driven by market conditions, but that's really about how these entities are run ultimately within the funds, and the performance has been good. And again, I know there's always some skepticism about the future performance, but as I pointed out, when you look at the last 8 quarters, it's been pretty steady. So we'll see how it goes over time, but the quality of the portfolio feels good. Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just Investment Banking and Investment Management, both those segments, the trends have been very strong, and it's been fairly consistent. When you look at the outlook, obviously, the M&A backdrop, that's easy to see. But when you look across those 2 segments, where do you see the big opportunities at this point in the cycle versus -- are there areas where you're starting to get concerned? Are the risks rising in the overall market that we could start to see some decrease in activity? Harvey M. Schwartz: So why don't we just start with the Advisory business? I mean, I think if, when we were doing this call a year ago, there was a lot of concern or question around, look, almost -- for lack of better language, will M&A ever come back? And now we sit here in an environment where there's lots of activity. And maybe in retrospect, sitting here, that doesn't look surprising because as sentiment shift and CEOs get more confident and global economic activity stabilizes, starts to grow, you start to see it. For us, during the slower part of the cycle, the slower part of the cycle was really aimed at making sure that we stayed connected with our clients. And I think you see it in some of the statistics. For transactions greater than $1 billion, we are in 60 of the transactions out of 175, and that's, give or take, roughly a 35% market share. And as I mentioned on the call, our market shares have continued to grow on a relative basis during this. Now when you think about other parts of the Investment Banking set and you think about debt, this was a big discussion again we had last year. I remember we hit a record in debt performance in the first quarter of last year, and there were a lot of questions about whether that's sustainable. So I think as economic growth continues to improve globally, the opportunity for Goldman Sachs to provide advice to our clients, capital to our clients, I think it feels pretty good, but it will be environment-driven. But it seems like there's some capacity from here. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : In the past, you've spoken about the strategic importance of growing the wealth management business. There's been some talk in the marketplace about Goldman expanding their business by acquisitions. Can you remind us about your ambitions and growth plans for that business and how you think about using M&A for growth? Harvey M. Schwartz: So the business has been a strategic growth focus for us for a number of years. We've taken a number of steps in that business, and this goes back multiple years, to really improve performance. And what you're seeing is you're seeing quality of performance, which is now driving pretty significant inflows and growth into the business. In terms of acquisitions, our philosophy on this is pretty straightforward. If we believe it's accretive to the business and we can provide value to our clients, we'll consider them. I mean, largely, what you've seen us do are bolt-ons. I mentioned the Deutsche Bank Stable Value business. That follows an acquisition we did a couple of years ago, and that's about building scale in a space where we feel we can provide value. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : That's helpful. Just switching over to FICC, apologies if I missed this on your prepared remarks, but clearly, June saw an improvement in activity levels. Could you provide a bit more color on which businesses and which regions did better? And also, I'd appreciate any insights into how July is progressing so far relative to June. Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of the quarter, as we all saw in the beginning of the quarter, there were some pretty negative forecasts related to kind of general client activity across Fixed Income and Equities. As the quarter went along and investors felt more comfortable, certainly, post the actions of rate policy announcements out of Europe, there was a more significant pickup in activity. I would say that relative to historical markets, volumes, and clearly, you're seeing it in volatility levels, really feel like they're bottoming a bit. But activity improved across the business broadly. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Nothing on July, I take it, then? Harvey M. Schwartz: Bit too early to tell. Chinedu Christian Onwugbolu - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's fair. Just my last question, really, is more of a broader question on Goldman's long-term competitive positioning. I guess the period post-crisis was really marked by industry consolidation, and since then, there's been significant growth in the non-bank financial sector. And as we move into stronger macroeconomic conditions, it seems to me that there'll be a lot of competition for Goldman's clients. I'll be curious on how you see Goldman competing against -- or competing in the sales and trading businesses against the balance sheet might and customer flow that the money center banks enjoy and also how Goldman competes against less-regulated firms such as the independent M&A brokers and the alternative asset managers. Harvey M. Schwartz: Okay, so why don't we start with Institutional Client Services? So we obviously have a very long history in these businesses, and one of the things we benefit from is the diversification of the business, so currencies, commodities, interest rates, by the way, also the leadership position we have in equities, client brokerage, derivatives. And our ability to commit capital has always been a defining characteristic for our clients. And so we feel that our competitive position now, relative to the rest of the market, it feels to us like it's a pretty good position. And so we'll have to see it evolves. We've seen pockets of areas where, when volatility has picked up, and I've talked about it in the last quarter, for example, in commodities, as far as we could tell, it felt like there was some kind of advantage, given our commitment and long history in the business, when the markets were volatile. But these are pretty quiet markets, as we discussed, some of the most historically low levels of volatility that we've ever seen. But the competitive position, when we think about our people, ability to hire, the talent, it feels strong. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Can you talk a bit about some of the ancillary businesses or business that you get from M&A and the timing of that? So obviously, we've had a lot of announced M&A, and I guess I usually think about the ancillary business occurring closer towards when the deals are actually completed. But just kind of a broader conversation, if you could talk a bit about the other businesses you get from the deals. Harvey M. Schwartz: Sure. So as I mentioned, the largest part of the growth in the backlog was in the announced, and obviously, we're extremely active in terms of our position in the marketplace. These transactions, as you know, they can take 6 to 9 months to close. Lots of the transactions we've seen have either been cross-border or they've had a debt component, and so there are a variety of different hedging elements that will go on associated with those transactions where we're providing advice. In general, those corresponding activities tend to happen around closure also, not in all cases, but for the most part, given the fact that there's always uncertainty about whether the transaction will be completed. Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So still a lot of that benefit, one would think, to come then? Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. Again, as I said, the backlog growth, which is the highest it's been since 2007, the backlog growth quarter-over-quarter really was driven by M&A and the announced transactions. Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just a bigger picture question on rising rates on the Fixed Income businesses. I guess in the old days, people used to think rising rates are bad for investment banks because they hold all this inventory, and you get marks on the way up. Although a higher rate environment, once you get there, might be better for activity. But I've noticed that for the industry overall, the inventory levels have come down pretty significantly versus a year ago. So I'm just wondering how you think about -- if we can split it, like the impact of rising rates as it's occurring versus once you get to a higher level. Harvey M. Schwartz: So it's a great question. If you look back in history in periods of rising interest rates, it's all very contextual. A lot of it depends on the base that you're coming from and whether or not the market was expecting or not expecting the move in the first place. In the end, it all relates back to is the rise in interest rates something that is a stimulus to activity, so we don't see inflation in the forecast. If you had rising rates as a result of inflation, and you had -- or struggling unemployment, I think generally speaking, that would be bad for activity. But in an environment where it's more of a return to normal, and we've been at such managed low levels for so long, but a normal environment with good, solid, stable economic growth, that may bode well for client activity. But again, it's all going to be activity-based. Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, on the comp ratio, you have historically done adjustments in the back half of the year, usually, in the fourth quarter. And I think last year, you did some in the third quarter as well. And just if you could comment on that, especially in light of the -- I think the FICC trading comps are pretty easy in the third quarter a year ago, but how, when we put it all together, think about the comp ratio at the back half of the year. Harvey M. Schwartz: So the 43% that you've seen this quarter, the first half of the year and actually, the first half of last year, for this quarter, obviously, it's our best estimate of where we think we are. We're reviewing it every quarter. Last year, you started to see some of the benefits maybe earlier than we have in the past versus -- in third quarter versus fourth quarter, just because of the cost savings that we had built into the enterprise. And so we'll continue to evaluate it every quarter. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just a couple of questions. One's a ticky-tacky on the SLR that you mentioned earlier. I know in your Fixed Income presentation from May, you had the SLR at the end of 1Q '14 at 4.2%, and then the press added the 10 bps to get you to 4.3%. So then on top of that, the balance sheet adjustments added another 10 bps to get us to 4.4% at quarter end. Is that the right math? Harvey M. Schwartz: No. So I have it at 4.3%, 4.4%, 4.5%, but there's a rounding in there, too, right, so when you go back and forth. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then if we assume all of Volcker-noncompliant $8 billion goes away, that's what gets you to above the 5%. Harvey M. Schwartz: No, just to be ticky-tacky, too, just so we're very clear, so the $8 billion is what still needs to be managed after you take adjustments for things that are already public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. The significant financial institution deduction itself is actually bigger, so that's $9 billion. And so once that's out and with extensions, as you know, the final compliance date is July 2017, as we know it now, that precedes the 2018 SLR requirement. That gets us north of 5%. Is that clear? Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. And then on the balance sheet freeing-up that you did, you have the relatively low-ROA assets that are not necessarily helping clients as much. I mean, I would think that you're doing that in part ahead of the significant M&A calendar that typically comes with lines of credit, bridge loans, et cetera. Is that fair? Harvey M. Schwartz: No, we don't -- again, from that perspective, we feel like we have more than enough capital adequacy and certainly more than enough liquidity in the balance sheet to support those franchise activities. This really was directly correlated to, basically, information that we've gained from the discussions around supplementary leverage ratio. And as I said, a significant factor is CCAR. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. So then the M&A activity, obviously, announced, as you indicated, up significantly, so we should have a nice second half here into '15. Any lines of credit that you're extending with those activities is on your books today. Is that correct? Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes, so the way they generally work is if we're committing to a financing, if we're left lead, then those show up as either unfunded commitments, or if they become funded, they show up as funded commitments. That's correct. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great, okay. And so part of that's already in the footings? Harvey M. Schwartz: That's correct, yes. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, as the Volcker-noncompliant rolls off and you're using the capital to reinvest elsewhere, I'm thinking about the fact that your clients have been involved with you on these noncompliant Volcker assets because they are alternatives. They are giving you, potentially, uncorrelated risks -- uncorrelated returns, I'm sorry, and that there's certain elements of this that might look akin to alternative investments. I'm just wondering what the strategy plan is for increasing your offerings in that area of asset management business. Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of the capital, I'll make a couple of points as it comes out. So obviously, we run a very large asset management business, and those clients can participate in that, as I mentioned, as they wish. So obviously, we run a very big alternatives business aside from the capital that's in these funds. Also remember, we can invest those dollars in other Volcker-compliant funds for our clients, and we can offer them those options. We can also co-invest with them in Volcker-approved structures, so there's enough flexibility where certainly, we feel like we can respond and deliver to our clients' needs. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. Yes, I get that. I'm just thinking there's some opportunity to expand the offerings even further. Harvey M. Schwartz: If you want to -- there certainly are as the capital moves around. But if you want to follow up with Dane and the team later, we can break down for you a bit how the alternatives asset line actually moves in terms of activities that we're being asked to exit and those that are growing side by side. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I have 3 questions around balance sheet optimization. The first is, what's left? So you reduced total assets by $56 billion. How much more is there to go? And also, the risk-weighted asset decline was only $5 billion versus the $56 billion. What's your priority looking ahead? Harvey M. Schwartz: So that's a great question, Mike. So in terms of the balance sheet, again, we're going to continue to reassess as we go forward. Standing here today, there certainly may be some room, but as we approach the third quarter, there are no strategic initiatives at this stage. But I would expect it to be around this area, but we'll see how things evolve. Again, it's going to be very much client-driven. In terms of the metrics, I think this is a great example of when we're complying with the various metrics, some are risk-based, and those are less -- those like the leverage ratio or leverage tests, are, by definition, not risk-based. And so the reason why you're not seeing a corresponding meaningful reduction in RWAs and you actually saw an increase in our Basel III advanced ratio from 11.3% to 11.4% is because this really is in response to those non-risk-based measures. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Got it. As it relates to loan growth, what are your priorities for growing loans, and do you think that loan growth in the industry is accelerating? Harvey M. Schwartz: So it's hard for me to see across the industry in terms of how it's accelerating. It feels like it may come off the bottom a bit, but I guess I would say the following, which is an important takeaway. So lending for us has always been an important component of how we provide strategic capital to our clients. Obviously, predominantly, our corporate clients and obviously an important component of our private wealth business, we don't target loan growth. Again, these activities, while well collateralized, particularly, for example, in private wealth, while well collateralized, again, this is risk-based capital, and so the way we manage it is through a limit process and through an individual approval process. And so we'd be pretty reluctant to target loan growth. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Can you just elaborate on your comment? You said loan growth does not seem to be accelerating. It's just a downfall... Harvey M. Schwartz: No, I said I don't have great view into the industry. It's been growing for us over the past year when you look at it, and we've just seen opportunities to work with our clients more closely, so we've been extending more capital. I don't have great view into the industry. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : And lastly, if you feel confident enough to restructure your balance sheet and downsize so much, does that mean you have better -- enough clarity on SLR and other regulations to set an ROE target anytime soon? I know I ask that every quarter, but it seems like you're making progress. Harvey M. Schwartz: So I got to say, Mike, actually, I don't think a quarterly call would feel complete for me if you and I didn't have this discussion. So I think we should plan to have it next quarter, and if we need to, we should have it the quarter after that. I don't mean to be glib, but I do enjoy the discussion. So how are we thinking about capital? And you're right. We're getting increasing clarity. In terms of our strategic priorities over the last several years, we've been focused on a number of things, most importantly, obviously, growing the franchise. And you're seeing pretty significant growth in areas where there' s activity : Advisory services, Investment Management. Obviously, we've seen more headwinds in other areas where there's been low volatility. But the most important thing is our focus on our clients. The second thing is about building, and we've talked about this a lot, operating leverage into the business so that we're positioned to grow returns when the environment improves and continues to improve. And so we're going through all these steps. In terms of returns in absolutes, we're being disciplined about how we deploy the balance sheet. You saw some of that this quarter. And in the end, Mike, look, we just aspire for better returns. In this environment, you've seen us do, give or take, 11% for 2.5 years, but we continue to look to aspire for better returns. And I think maybe the balance sheet this quarter, even though it's just 1 quarter, taking it down $56 billion, I think that's a good example of some of the steps we're taking. Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division : I mean, the 11% ROE is so far below where you've been historically. The question is, do you just stay here for a long period of time? Harvey M. Schwartz: Well, I don't know. My crystal ball has never been quite good on these things, but we could certainly have a discussion around -- if volatility picked up and you saw activity levels, I think that the future will be what it will be. Again, what we try to do during this period where it's been so much lower is find the right balance. And by balance, I mean protecting our client franchise, at the same time, building these efficiencies. And look, I think when you look at it over the cycle, I think our returns, on a relative basis, they look pretty good. They've been superior. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : First, I just wanted to revisit the tax rate comments that you made in terms of having made some permanent offshore reinvestment decisions. Is this something that will continue and accelerate going forward? Should we begin to think about tweaking down the core tax rate that we use in computing earnings? Harvey M. Schwartz: No, so there's 2 things here. One is obviously as we review capital needs around the globe, in this particular quarter, we made an election to permanently reinvest capital. But it's also earnings-mix-driven. And so in terms of the capital needs, I think you should treat that as a one-time event. Earnings mix will be what it'd be, driven by client activity around the globe. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : Got it. So this isn't a call to begin to shave a point or 2 off the tax rate that we use in forecasting? Harvey M. Schwartz: No. We're a high tax payer. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : Just wanted to make sure that we get fully phased-in Basel III ratios, core equity Tier 1. Harvey M. Schwartz: So again, the 11.4% was the transitional and 10.9%, and fully phased-in would be 9.8% and 9.3% -- sorry, 9 -- yes. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : All right. Advanced and standardized, in that order, is that right? Harvey M. Schwartz: That's correct. I'm sorry. I misspoke. I said 9.3% and I should have said 9.4%. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : 9.4%? Okay. Great. Harvey M. Schwartz: There's the transitional ratio and then there's the fully phased. And so when I went through it, I just misspoke. I apologize. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : Got it. That helps. You obviously mentioned, both in the release and the press and your comments before, that headcount is down about 1% off the end of last quarter. Obviously not a big number, but just makes me want to ask if you can give a say, year-to-date, what the puts and takes are. If not quantified, at least where are you adding and where are you rationalizing, by key line of business? Harvey M. Schwartz: All right. So well I think in terms of the aggregate, as we come into the third and fourth quarter, our new analysts will be coming on board, so you should expect that year-end headcount will continue to come up a little bit. We've been very focused on the pyramid, as we referred to it, over the last several years, and also simultaneously investing in those areas that have been growing, like asset management. And Gary spoke about this at a recent conference, if you take Fixed Income as an example over the last couple of years, headcount has been down roughly 10%. And so it's very business-specific-driven in terms of how we're adjusting the resources. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : Got it. So mostly down in Fixed Income, up in asset management, pretty much stable everywhere else, is that the right takeaway? Harvey M. Schwartz: That's about right. And also I would say, in general, we feel pretty comfortable in terms of how the global business is right-sized at this stage. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : And when you made that comment about the pyramid, does that refer to the fact that in order to try to make the lifestyle implications for the junior staff a little bit more manageable, you've upsized what, 10%, 15% in terms of the analyst class, is that what you're talking about? Harvey M. Schwartz: No. I was talking more about -- I'm glad you asked me to clarify. I was talking more about post-2008, when we normally get sort of a, call it, every other year, series of retirements of partners, many people elected to delay what otherwise were retirement plans. They just felt like they needed to be here. And so we've just seen some acceleration of that, but it's been fully expected. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : Got it. Okay. Yes, that helps. Final question, just to revisit the balance sheet exercise that you went through, and thanks for talking about that, that's very interesting. Is there some way that you can quantify for us the ROE impact over the next year or 2 of having made the changes that you've made, assuming that you can do what you want to do with CCAR? Harvey M. Schwartz: So obviously, we can't predict future CCAR results, and so that's difficult to assess. I think when you think about how any firm, certainly Goldman Sachs, needs to manage capital in an environment of multiple constraints, it's about finding the right place to comply with the rules, and at the same time, building maximum flexibility, so you can be there for your clients when they need you to be. And when you have excess capital, be in a position to return it. And that's what all these exercises are about. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP : So you didn't -- you didn't undertake it with the thought that if you optimize in this way, you could add 100, 200, 300 basis points, over time, to ROE in a normalized environment. It's more about, as you said, being prepared to provide more risk and remediation when the markets call for that, that type of thing? Harvey M. Schwartz: So the way I would think about it is, less figuring out a target in terms of capital flexibility and the CCAR process, because again, we don't have much visibility, we don't know what next year's test is going to look like. The key driver of the exercise is the dialogue we have with clients as we undertake it. And so as we work through that process and we feel the capacity is there, then obviously, it's the more efficient way to deploy our capital. And so we'll see how future CCAR tests go, but look, certainly having more capacity in terms of flexibility is preferred, but again, the key driver is going to be how our clients -- what our clients need from our balance sheet. And as I said earlier, in this case, we're able to reduce the $25 billion out of the matched book. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I just have 2 questions, please. One was regarding the deductions, because I was surprised that the look-through, although fully phased-in, ratio hadn't improved more. Could you just go through those again? I think you mentioned an $8 billion number, but then also a $9 billion number. And then the second question was really on the non-compensation expenses underlying. They seem pretty steady, give or take, taking out litigation in the last 3 or 4 quarters. Is there a target to keep them flat over a period of time, and is there quite a lot going on in the background for that to happen? Harvey M. Schwartz: Okay. So I'm really glad you asked the first question, because I certainly don't want to leave anybody confused on this topic. Those are different numbers. That's the important takeaway, they're different numbers. The first number, the $8 billion, that relates to the dollars in funds that we need to ultimately remove from those funds as we harvest alongside our clients to comply with the Volcker Rule. And the reason I highlighted that in the last call, it's roughly $9 billion, now it's a bit north of $8 billion, was when you look at our financial disclosure, you would see roughly a $14 billion number in terms of total investments. But there are capital, there are capital allowances, there are assets that are already public, there are other funds that are approved, and so I just want to make sure you have some scale. And that number has moved down to roughly $8 billion since January. Okay, that's one number. They just happen to be very close in size. Under the Basel III capital rules, you get a certain allocation for which you are allowed to have dollars invested in what they call significant financial institutions. For us, that is a dollar-for-dollar deduction from capital that is $9 billion. Now as we comply with the Volcker Rule, that $9 billion comes out just side-by-side, which is why we give you some sense of that and its future impact on our capital ratios. Is that clear? Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just to clarify, the $9 billion deduction under the calculation you disclosed hasn't really moved because of maybe some other offsetting factors? Or... Harvey M. Schwartz: Okay. So that number is driven by the aggregate. And so that number, again, is a different number versus the $8 billion that is still in funds but isn't yet public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that includes, for example, that includes assets that are already taken public but are still sitting in the funds and they're working through the sell-down process. And just remind me, what was your second question, Fiona? I'm sorry. Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just on the non-compensation expenses, if you strip out litigation they're very flat over a long period of time. Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. So we're staying very focused on non-comp. As you know, several years ago, we went through an exercise to take out roughly $2 billion of cost out of the enterprise. At this stage, we continue to stay very focused on it, but there hasn't been any material movement. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : So I just wanted to kick things off with, actually, a big picture FICC-related question. So shortly after Basel III and Dodd-Frank, at a number of investor conferences, you guys highlighted, I suppose, the potential opportunity for FICC industry fee growth in the context of the paradigms, let's call it, of FX and equity electronification, suggesting that we could actually see some improvement in the revenue backdrop. And I thought it was quite telling where, flash forward to the Bernstein Conference last month, I felt as though your comments, as well as Gary's, were a bit more measured on the long-term outlook. And Gary specifically highlighted some challenges to FICC digitization, and relating to that, he even made some explicit references to TRACE. And the TRACE experience, I guess, in my mind, is more of a cautionary tale where you saw really meaningful spread compression in terms of corporate bond pricing and only a modest volume improvement, resulting in a net revenue decline. So we're now 4 years into the adjustment process within FICC, and I'm wondering whether your fundamental outlook for the FICC industry has changed, and more specifically, whether we should even read into Gary's explicit references to TRACE in the context of your views on FICC. Harvey M. Schwartz: Okay. So let's back up and let's just take history into context a bit. In FICC, and actually in Equities, the advancements in technology, if you will, we would say that's been a secular change that's been in place for well, well over a decade. And whether it was in Equities where, back in what some people call the good old days, you have $0.06, $0.065 commissions, which collapsed with electronification and decimalization and other rules that the regulators put in place, I don't remember, actually, Gary's explicit comments about TRACE, but I think his point was that when technology first gets adapted, there's an adjustment process that goes through. Now if you look at it over multiple years, I think our experience with TRACE would be similar to the experience we saw in the government bond market with Tradeweb, and the same as I described with Equities where you go through a market adjustment period, but for example, in our, in TRACE, again, I don't remember exactly Gary's comments, but I think he was mostly speaking about the high-yield market when it first came onboard. At first, when TRACE came onboard, I think it was actually disruptive to liquidity. That was the feedback we got from clients. But then as the market adjusted, over time, we actually found that our leverage finance and high-yield franchise got stronger. Now I could give you a whole host of examples like that. Again, the government bond market, when we started trading government bonds on Tradeweb, everyone said that business was over, just like, by the way, they said the same thing when the euro was created. And over time, these businesses have generally -- we've been in a position where we've been able to provide more value to our clients, enhance liquidity to our clients. Now in terms of the last couple of years, obviously, the regulators have been quite effective, and I think they deserve a lot of credit for deploying clearing. We're in the early stages of swap execution facilities. It's not our sense that those things have been headwinds for the business. This has really been much more climate-driven in terms of the low volatility, but it's something we stay quite focused on. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Okay. So essentially, your view hasn't really shifted? Harvey M. Schwartz: Now, that was a long-winded answer, but you did ask for big picture, so I apologize if that was... Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : No, it's extremely helpful, so I appreciate it. Harvey M. Schwartz: No problem. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : And then shifting gears and moving on to preferred issuance and your capital structure. So you noted that you had issued $2 billion in the preferreds in the quarter, and to my knowledge, you're the only universal bank which is actually at the 150-basis-point RWA target that's contemplated under Basel III, which -- I guess I can interpret it 2 different ways : either you've taken advantage of the cheap cost of issuing, perhaps, in the current backdrop and have no intention of tapping the market anytime soon; or, in an effort to cover the current SLR shortfall, which currently exists, you actually plan on issuing additional prefs from here in order to optimize your capital structure. I was hoping you could at least explain what's driving the preferred issuance plans going forward. Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. So I think the simple question are we full, we'll assess it as we go forward. You also saw in the quarter that we launched a tender for trust preferreds, which is capital that under the Basel rules didn't qualify. And so you should think of this as adjusting in terms of -- again, in complying in response to the regulation, so trust preferreds aren't considered valuable capital and so you'll see preferreds come into the mix. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : But do you have any intention of issuing additional preferreds from here? At least in, call it, the next -- in the near to intermediate term, because you are essentially full? Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. We'll continue to evaluate it and we'll see how we proceed. But again, this is all part of our capital planning and consistent with our CCAR plan, so... Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Okay. And then just one last one for me on the topic of, I guess, the term that we've used internally is bindingness, but the need for U.S. SIFIs to manage to the multiple binding capital constraints that you had talked about earlier. And as far as we can tell, there's 4 constraints that really seem to matter. So you have the 2 risk-based targets, advanced and standardized, and clearly, you screen quite well in those metrics. Separately, we look at CCAR. And clearly, you've been able to support outsized payouts over the last couple of years while getting past the stress test. And then, lastly, we have the SLR. And your comments indicated that you could -- that pro forma, I suppose the reduction in the Basel III deductions to financial institutions, that you'll be just above the 5%. But when looking at required capital levels, it looks as though it's actually going to be highest under the SLR. And while I don't want to ask you for, once again, for an explicit ROE target, I wanted to get a sense as to how you're thinking about the relevant binding constraints and how you plan on -- whether you plan on optimizing your capital position based on the 4 that, I guess, I had just mentioned. Harvey M. Schwartz: Okay. So as you mentioned, there are a number of constraints, mostly risk-based, right? CCAR, Basel III, standardized -- I'm sorry, advanced, standardized, a bit mix, but also risk-based, and then non-risk-based, which is the bucket I would put the leverage ratio or leverage test into. In terms of the supplementary leverage ratio, because we would agree with you, based on the Basel III advanced and standardized, lots of capacity at this stage. So let's begin honing on the supplementary leverage ratio. A couple of factors. Again, we haven't seen the final rule, so we'll have to see the final rule in the context of the denominator. We don't have to fully comply until 2018 and so the reason I give you the natural adjustment that will happen in terms of the $9 billion coming out of funds is because it's such a tax on the current capital position. And so as that comes out, you can see the flexibility. Now because we haven't seen the final rule, we haven't really taken any steps to mitigate it. As you know, our policy is to see the final rule, and when we see the final rule or have some very strong sense of the final rule, then we're willing to look at how we should comply. Now how do we do that? And we've talked about this in the past, but we'll, we begin, again, by providing tools to the businesses, and then as a leadership group, we figure out the best way to deliver capital to our clients, and at the same time, comply with the rules. Now CCAR obviously as an annual test, last year for us, was a binding constraint. And so you'll see us adjust there as we can as well. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : So how do I reconcile those comments that the rules haven't been finalized, so you haven't been actively mitigating, with the balance sheet reduction that we saw in the quarter? Harvey M. Schwartz: So as I said, the leverage ratio has an impact there, but also CCAR a significant factor. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Just a quick follow-up, maybe just on the balance sheet question. It was very helpful, you talked about the matched book coming down $25 billion, but the total balance sheet down $55 billion. Could you give any color on the other $30 billion? Harvey M. Schwartz: So it's $56 billion in total, roughly $25 billion out of the matched book. It was various back-and-forth items in terms of just basically things, as I said, mostly secured client financings, client cash, things like that. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. Just kind of broad-based. And then if we think about the... Harvey M. Schwartz: Again, the takeaway, low ROA, Jim. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Right. Right. No, I here you. And then on the -- just not to beat a dead horse in the SLR, just wanted to make sure I understand this. Sequentially, it seems like you didn't -- if I look at it the right way, it doesn't feel like you got a lot of benefit on the SLR from the reduced balance sheet. And is that a fair way to think about it? Is it just sort of a timing thing, because it's under the SLR guidelines it's average and you did most of that towards the end of the quarter or should we see more to go on the SLR in the next quarter? Just trying to run the math, it doesn't feel like there was a lot of benefit on the balance sheet reduction in SLR. Harvey M. Schwartz: There were certainly benefits. The big things that factor into the SLR are... James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Obviously, derivatives. Harvey M. Schwartz: Correct. And so when I say that we haven't taken any steps to comply with those rules, we're going to wait until we see the final rules on that before we really begin to address that. That really has to do with credit derivatives and the way various maturities are treated. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Right. And you haven't really done much there in terms of whether it's compression trades, things like that yet, as you await the final rules, is that sort of the takeaway? Harvey M. Schwartz: So compression trades have obviously picked up over the last, call it, year or so within the industry. But again, in terms of addressing that item, we really want to see the final rule before we take any steps. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay. So there still could be more to come there? Harvey M. Schwartz: I would expect that. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : And then lastly on SACCR, do you still think it's 10 to 15 or have you refined that at all, in terms of the benefit? Because again, some of your peers have been more aggressive in saying it would help them more significantly. Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes, I didn't include that in the numbers today. We're not -- it's not 100% clear to us that in the final rule, SACCR is going to be a component. It's no different than it was. I did mention it on the last call, but again... James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : The 10 to 15. Harvey M. Schwartz: But again, I don't think we should necessarily -- we don't want to count things that aren't necessarily, we think, in the final rule. So we're just giving you kind of the mark-to-market on this today, and then we can give you adjustments because we know that other capital has to come out of the funds. So those are things we know. But if it does come to fruition, it's 10 or 15 basis points also. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Right. Okay. And then just switching gears, just last question. In asset management, seems like the performance definitely picked up. You've had good flows, particularly in Fixed Income, and Equities is doing better as well. But alternatives seem to be still be choppy, even though there's been industry-wide good flows, is that just still struggling performance there or just the type of funds you're offering? How do we think about -- seeing -- when -- how should we think about flows improving on the alternative side? Harvey M. Schwartz: So when you -- so our alternative performance has been strong also. What you're seeing is the mix of the harvesting versus areas like fund-of-funds. And Dane and the team can give you a breakdown on sort of how those flows, but you can see the growth there also. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Okay, so it's more of the harvesting. Harvey M. Schwartz: Right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co. Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Just curious if you can say -- I mean, $56 billion isn't a lot in assets, and if you view them as CCAR-onerous, surely every other financial institution in the world also views them as CCAR-onerous. So just curious, who took your side of the trade? Or, I mean, is it non-bank financials? Is it funds? Is it -- or is it just that it's a complete tear-up and those positions don't exist in the marketplace anymore? Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes, it's a good question. So obviously, we have no visibility into our competitors' strategies and certainly how they're thinking about CCAR. I think that a lot's been written about the repo markets. Certainly, our $25 billion reduction in the matched book had no marginal impact in terms of the repo market, but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves because, as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple constraints. Each bank will address their constraints, in they think the way that's most impactful for their clients. That's how we approached it. And so we'll have to see how it evolves in terms of, ultimately, if all firms adopted this strategy, what impact that has on liquidity and how liquidity gets provided, but it's very early in that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So a quick one, first, on the market piece. I think you had told Glenn it flowed through I&L, but can you give us a sense of how much the Equities revenues were impacted by the gains from that transaction? Harvey M. Schwartz: So I'm happy to tell you, it was roughly $50 million in terms of market's contribution. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Perfect. And then insofar as the non-comp, just following up on Fiona's question, was there any impact from the sale of the reinsurance business from last year? So like when we look at '13 versus '14, how much should we think about dropping out of non-comp from the sale of businesses? And then if you could also maybe give us a sense of variable and fixed in that line might be helpful. Harvey M. Schwartz: You can see in the insurance line in the expense base, and then if you check the earnings release, I think we have the detail there. But the reinsurance revenues for the first half of last year were roughly $315 million, I think, $317 million to be specific, but we can give you the full number. But Dane can follow through on the insurance reserves that came out. When you actually look at it, 6 months to 6 months, year-over-year, when you look at that sale, basically, revenues are pretty much flat year-to-year. We replaced that with, obviously, other activity in the franchise. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Yes. No, I'm sorry, I was asking about the non-comp side, on the expense, but okay. And then last one, quickly, is security services. So you guys are tracking to be up a bit here on last year, but pretty well below still prior years. And so I just was kind of curious as to what maybe might be driving that sort of moderate bounceback, given markets at peak levels and some competitors highlighting some strength in that business. Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of our prime services business, that franchise feels incredibly strong to us in terms of its differentiating characteristics. In terms of performance, that'll be driven by a number of factors : balances, the degree to which market participants are short and borrow stock. And so I think it just really reflects the current environment. Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So you think it's far more cyclical and not anything specific to the franchise or anything, any changes that you guys have made? Harvey M. Schwartz: No, definitely not. Definitely nothing in the franchise. As I said, the franchise feels quite good. Part of that business is about lending stock into short positions and sourcing short positions. And in this kind of marketplace, where it's been steadily rising and you have lower conviction, you don't see as much of that performance. But the franchise feels quite good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just a couple of quick ones for me. Just in terms of the -- it looks like the pace of buybacks increased a little bit this quarter, perhaps that was just a second quarter phenomenon coming out of the CCAR approval. But I'm just curious as to how you all are thinking about potential buybacks through the course of the year, given that you got a pretty sizable, about 5 quarters of buybacks, available at this point. Harvey M. Schwartz: Right. So we did $1.25 billion, as I mentioned, in the quarter. And so -- again, one of the things in terms of the way we approach the capital planning is we really don't want our folks and our investors to think of stock repurchase as a dividend. So one of the things we don't do is we don't announce our stock repurchase capacity at the beginning of the year because we treat it dynamically, it'll be environment-driven. In this particular part of the environment where you see our capital ratios are very high, we just felt like we're in a position to return that capital, and that will be our philosophy going forward. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just a question on the operating risk, RWA. I think you mentioned last quarter that, that was about $90 billion. I guess I'm curious as to whether or not that's changed at all, given some of the litigation issues that have beset other companies. And obviously, you all have had a little bit of litigation running through the P&L as well. Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes, so when we came off the Basel III parallel run, we didn't -- we weren't asked to make any significant adjustments to up risk capital. It hasn't moved materially quarter-over-quarter, but we will continue to assess it, and the extent to which we have isolated events and we take reserves, it will impact it accordingly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Just wanted to drill down a little bit on Fixed Income, both primary and secondary. First, I guess -- and so we have the Fed finally announcing they plan to be done with buying, I believe, in October. Anyone inside the organization thinking that could be a little bit of a catalyst for FICC, particularly volatility in treasuries, or is it still really more based on just overall market environment? Because it is continuing to feel like them in the market has been a hindrance for other levels of activity. Harvey M. Schwartz: Well, I think if you were to look back 1 year ago, and I think it was May 22 in 2013, the initial announcements of tapering came out. I think you -- look, I think you have to consider it a pretty extraordinary success in terms of the way the Federal Reserve has navigated that announcement and the process and the way the market has responded to it. There was obviously some initial volatility because there was some uncertainty on what tapering means. Our sense is that it's been executed quite well. The market understands it. The communication has been good. And so, in a sense, I don't want to say anything is always fully baked in, but I think the market has adjusted to the notion of tapering and so there's not a lot of new information in it for the market to adjust to. Now of course, that's always in the context of what's happening in the global economy and political events and everything else, and so there's always other factors. But I think, narrowly defined, I think we'd call tapering a success. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : But just expanding on that, I mean just the fact that, potentially, they were maybe crowding out players in the market, and to the extent that doesn't exist anymore, you're not seeing that maybe as a little bit of a boost to the business, post-October or as we get closer to the deadline where they're done. Harvey M. Schwartz: It's a factor. There are a number of factors. I think sentiment, global growth, what happens with volatilities and trends are bigger, but it's always -- it certainly is a factor. Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay, great. And then just second question. Obviously, the banking continues to be very strong. The debt origination continues to be very resilient. It looks like Europe and maybe some of the high-yield markets in Europe have been really good this year, and I'm just wondering, for the longest time, people would talk about the potential disintermediation of the European lending market versus the bond market being a driver for your industry. I mean, is that something we're starting to see a little bit more of now, with some of the constraints on the banking sector there, that the bond market is picking up. Can you maybe elaborate a little on that, because it did look like European credit, particularly high yield, was really good for the industry this quarter? Harvey M. Schwartz: So obviously, we've had a long commitment to our European business. And as they work through the geographic regions associated with their part of the crisis, certainly, we've seen opportunities to work very closely with clients. I think the shift from, as you -- we would call it and you would call it, bank-related financing, the debt capital markets, is something that's underway. But that's certainly, I think, a long-term trend and so we'll see it evolve over many years. Now where you have seen, obviously, a huge amount of immediately picked up activity across Europe, was basically in the equity capital markets. We obviously rank #1 there, but the amount of capital raised was pretty extraordinary in the quarter, over $180 billion, 600 [ph] deals in the first half of the year alone. And so there's a lot of activity in Europe. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to just follow up on your comments on the VaR. I'm just trying to reconcile the continued compression across volatility in most products, and well as some of the balance sheet reductions. And yet it would seem that some of the more -- well, basically all of the FICC products didn't seem to show too much movement, so I'm just trying to understand the dynamics. Harvey M. Schwartz: So as I mentioned, quarter-over-quarter, the bigger mover was in Equities, and that was a combination of volatility and risk coming down. When you look across it, most of the movement in the quarter, when you look across the various asset classes, was more volatility-driven, again corresponding with the extremely low vol levels that we've talked about. Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division : And the -- so the balance sheet actions, I guess, didn't have much of a role. And I guess, is that reflected then in the limited changes around RWAs? Just... Harvey M. Schwartz: Yes. So again, this is this important distinction between those regulatory measures that deal with things that are risk-based, like the Basel III rules, and those things that are not risk-based or not as much risk-based, like leverage tests. And so this was really, as I said, not risk-based parts of the balance sheet, low ROA portions of the balance sheet like the matched book. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Just 2 quick questions. On the Basel III ratios that you gave, what was the risk weighted assets for the advanced and standardized, and the breakdown there? Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of the quarter, under the advanced, $592 billion, and under standardized, $619 billion. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then as you're repositioning the balance sheet, as well as looking forward to next year's CCAR, how do you think about the dry powder that you have with the excess capital that's available that could be deployed into the other businesses. When you submitted last year's CCAR, you were at like a 9.2% under the Basel III standardized. Is that the right way to think about the floor in the capital ratios that you would target to manage the business? Harvey M. Schwartz: So as we've talked about in the past, we have a target of 9.5%, we're running at an 11.4% level, so clearly, we feel like we have more than enough capital capacity to deploy that capital. And so we feel like we have a lot of flexibility at this stage to respond to our clients' needs. In terms of future CCAR tests, we'll see how they go. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : But would that target move lower now, now that you're doing these balance sheet actions? Harvey M. Schwartz: It's something we'll look at. It's possible, I certainly don't see it moving any higher. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : Just a couple quick follow-ups here. So first, with respect to the comments on competitive positioning, debt underwriting, you highlighted it was a good market, but you guys have also been moving up the league tables quite a bit there, both within investment grade and high-yield, so that's also showing up within results. So would you attribute that to something that Goldman is doing specifically in those businesses, just given, maybe, better economics, or are peers becoming less competitive, which is creating openings? Just trying to get some perspective there. And then with respect to deal financing, it doesn't sound like that there's any issues that you're seeing, but do you expect any impact just from greater regulatory pressure on the more highly levered deals? Harvey M. Schwartz: So in terms of our position, obviously, we've been participating in some large significant transactions, and the more that you see -- the more you see financing driven by advisory activity or merger activity, given our role in that marketplace, you'd expect us to be more significantly involved. Now obviously, the debt business has been a very important business to Goldman Sachs for a number of years. Historically, we haven't been the most aggressive lender certainly, we haven't felt the risk return in terms of that activity. But you know, in the most important transactions, where content and execution are at a premium, we've done a pretty good job of staying involved. We won't always be, but we've done a pretty good job. In terms of -- I mean, you're talking specifically about the leverage finance rules. Again, a bit of a work in progress. Obviously, a very significant focus for the regulators. I think this is one of these things where the market, over time, will find its way in terms of those clients that want to use significant leverage. But at this stage, I think the whole market and the industry is sort of adjusting and working its way through. I think at this stage, it hasn't -- it certainly hasn't impacted people's ability to get transactions done in the way they want to get them done. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division : I appreciate the color. And then just secondly, just maybe coming at the balance sheet topic again. I really appreciate all the detail in the prior questions. But when thinking about the mechanics of the ROE and what's going to drive it higher over time, just from a really simplistic perspective, profit margins are already back to where they were in 2007, and so it sounds like improving asset productivity is going to be the primary contributor. But when you look at the mix of businesses today at the firm, is there anything that has changed where you feel like there should be further upside in profit margin from where we were during the prior cycle? Harvey M. Schwartz: So as we've talked about, we feel like we have significant operating leverage from here. Maybe the best way to characterize that, it's a bit of a blunt metric, but if you look at our compensation ratio, call it, post-crisis versus pre-crisis, it's been averaging 900 basis points lower. And so it's a pretty significant change in the cost structure of the firm in terms of the steps that we've taken, and yet when you, and I think this is really important to underscore, when you look at our results and you look at our relative position in M&A, or as mentioned, in the debt activity or certainly in equity, our performance in Institutional Client Services or the growth in asset management, we've been able to achieve all that simultaneously. And that's with certain of our businesses, particularly Equities and Fixed Income, really in a low vol kind of a headwind-oriented environment. And so if we went through a period where we saw revenue tailwinds, we feel like we're well-positioned in terms of our clients and the franchise, and certainly, there's meaningful upside in terms of operating leverage. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Sorry to flog a dead horse, but small questions on SLR. Do you have particular targets in mind going towards in 2014, or indeed, towards the 2015 CCAR for what SLR you envisage? Harvey M. Schwartz: So certainly, no targets yet. We want to see, again, the final rule. And again, I think the regulators have done a very thoughtful thing here. In terms of the compliance, given there's a multi-year compliance glide path, if you will, to 2018, we haven't set a target yet. When we see the final rule, we'll work with it, like we have with all the other rules, and then we'll eventually have a target that we'll manage to. As I said earlier, without really taking significant steps, right now, when you add up all the math, the preferred, the balance sheet exercise, and obviously, the capital that will come out from the significant financial institution deduction, we see ourselves achieving something that's in excess of 5%, but there's no target set yet. Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Right, I see. And in terms of managing that SLR, can you state explicitly whether you can issue more preferred stock over and above that 150 basis point limit on RWAs for the purposes of contributing to the numerator in your SLR? Harvey M. Schwartz: So I think we have the flexibility, I don't know necessarily that -- again, we'll see the final rule. I don't know necessarily whether it will be a preferred, to use that language, our preferred approach in terms of complying with the rule. Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : So it's not your preferred approach, but you can do if you wanted to, is that correct? Harvey M. Schwartz: I believe we have the capacity. But again, that would be also something that any firm would have to work through with their CCAR plan, et cetera, right? We're just talking about capital management outside of CCAR, right? So we're being very specific now. Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Okay. Okay. And then, sorry, how much could you reduce your balance sheet by if you reduced your compression trades, theoretically? Harvey M. Schwartz: I don't know the number off the top of my head. Sorry. Andrew Lim - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Right. Okay. And then very lastly, just thinking about catalysts to turning around the weak trading environment, obviously, we're living in a world of very low volatility. I think you yourselves and other banks talk about a subdued economic environment causing this low volatility, but to my mind, it's not really that bad. Global economic growth is still positive, and especially in the U.S. and the U.K. I mean what do we really need to get a turnaround in volatility in trading volumes? Are we missing other catalysts here to fall into place? Harvey M. Schwartz: So in the end, it's going to be economic growth. And look, I agree with you, we've come off a very low level in terms of economic growth and it's positive. But economic growth in the long-term is really what's going to drive sentiment and sentiment will drive activity and not all businesses participate in sentiment in the same way. Again, we've seen a big sentiment shift year-over-year in terms of the way CEOs are thinking about merger advisory activity. Hard to tell when that sentiment shift will change in terms of driving more position changes in terms of the way people think about their portfolios. We'll see. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey M. Schwartz: So again, since there are no more questions, I and the team, we just want to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, we'll get to talk to you, and myself and other members of management will get to see you in the coming months. Of course, if there are any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, everyone, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on the next call. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our third quarter results, then I'm obviously happy to answer any questions. Third quarter net revenues were $8.4 billion; net earnings, $2.2 billion; earnings per diluted share, $4.57. Core to our strategy over the past few years has been a consistent focus on strengthening our relative position within the industry. Our success begins with a fundamental approach of engaging our clients, understanding their challenges and then addressing their needs. That is the foundation for expanding the breadth and depth of our existing relationships and the basis for building new ones. For the first nine months in 2014, revenues are 1.4 billion higher than this time last year. The increase reflects the combination of greater client activity in certain businesses and a strong market position. For example, as client activity picked up in global M&A, you saw an increase in our market share. Our global market share in announced M&A for the year-to-date of 29% is up 300 basis points compared to 2013. Our volume advantage to our next closest peer is more than $100 billion. We have also been focused on making sure that we are well positioned to deliver operating leverage as client activity increases. In 2011, we announced an operating efficiency initiative. This initiative was subsequently increased twice and ultimately reached nearly $2 billion. We continue to expand upon that prior initiative to grow margins and increase returns. The benefits of those efforts are demonstrated in our year-to-date results. We had 1.4 billion of incremental revenues and nearly $1 billion of incremental pre-tax earnings. Ultimately, the embedded operating leverage contributed to an improvement in our year-to-date annualized return on common equity to 11.2%. We have also achieved this result by being a prudent allocator of our global resources. Getting this right not only drives positive results for our clients, but also for our shareholders. Now let me take you through the quarterly results for each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, down 18% compared to a strong second quarter. Importantly, our investment banking backlog increased again during the quarter, reaching its highest level since 2007. Third quarter advisory revenues were 594 million, up 17% from the second quarter on an increase in completed activity. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including Hillshire Brands' $8.6 billion sales to Tyson Foods, InterMune\u2019s $8.3 billion sale to Roche Holdings and Gates Corporation\u2019s $5.4 billion sale to Blackstone. We're also an advisor on a number of significant announced transactions. For example, we\u2019re advising on TRW Automotive's $13.5 billion sale to ZF Friedrichshafen, Siemens' $7.6 billion acquisition of Dresser-Rand and Corio's \u20ac7.2 billion sale to Kl\u00e9pierre. Moving to underwriting. Net revenues were 870 million in the third quarter, down 32% compared to record second quarter results. Equity underwriting revenues, up 426 million, were 22% lower sequentially as industry wide activity decline in the third quarter across secondary offerings. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 39% from a record second quarter to 444 million due to reduced activity particularly within leverage finance. During the third quarter, we remained committed to meeting our clients' diverse finance needs, whether it was Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion IPO, Sysco\u2019s $5 billion financing in support of its acquisition of US Foods or ADP's $1.6 billion high-yield offering. Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $3.8 billion in the third quarter with FICC Client Execution of 2.2 billion and Equities of $1.6 billion. ICS includes a one-time $270 million gain related to the tender of a portion of our trust preferred security. Excluding the fixed portion of the one-time gain in DVA, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially. Mortgages declined quarter-over-quarter as clients were less active amid a relatively stable backdrop of prices. Credit declined significantly as increased volatility, wider credit spreads and lower issuance provided a more difficult backdrop. Currencies, interest rates and commodities were all higher sequentially as volatility and volumes generally increased from relatively low levels. When you exclude equities portion of the one-time gain in DVA, the results within this segment were as follows. Total Equities net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 10% sequentially; Equities Client Execution net revenues of $372 million were down 26% quarter-over-quarter reflecting lower net revenues in cash products; commissions and fees were 745 million, relatively flat with the second quarter; securities services generated net revenues of 343 million, down 8% sequentially from the seasonally stronger second quarter. Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the third quarter was 66 million, down 14% relative to the second quarter, mostly driven by interest rates. Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively they produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of 876 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including IPOs and net gains in public equities. For example, one of our investments, Mobileye went public and our investment generated 285 million in net gains during the third quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were 606 million and benefited from net gains on certain investments due to asset sales and net interest income. Other revenues of 210 million include revenues from the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments. In Investment Management, we reported third quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. Management and other fees reached a record 1.21 billion. During the quarter total assets under supervision increased $8 billion to a record $1.15 trillion. Let me quickly walk you through the long-term flows. Long-term assets under supervision had net inflows of $13 billion with 7 billion in equity assets and $6 billion in fixed income assets. This was largely offset by foreign currency translation which drove net market depreciation of $12 billion. As we have discussed before, the key to long-term success is delivering strong and consistent performance for our Investment Management clients. Across the global platform, 81% of our client mutual funds' assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis and 76% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 300 basis points lower than the Firm's accrual in the first half of the year. The lower compensation accrual reflects stronger year-to-date revenues, greater clarity on full year compensation levels and our continued efforts to improve operating efficiency across the firm. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 4% sequentially. Now let me quickly run you through some key stats. Total staff at the end of the third quarter was approximately 33,500. This is up 3% from the second quarter due to summer hiring. Our effective tax rate was 31% year-to-date. Our global core excess liquidity ended the quarter at $180 million. Our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using the advanced approach. It was 11.1% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 4.9% based on the final rules. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. And finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.55 to $0.60 per share. Before we turn to Q&A, let me leave you with some concluding thoughts. A constant in our history as a public company is an unrelenting desire to provide world class service to our clients and superior returns to our shareholders. Given the dynamic nature of our industry, meeting that objective requires adaptability. Since we went public in 1999, there are several examples that are readily available. We went from 250 billion assets in 1999 to 1.2 trillion in 2008 and then back to approximately $870 billion today. And along the way we made Goldman Sachs a stronger firm. We increased our common equity from $10 million to over $70 billion and substantially increased our liquidity pool which now fits at $180 billion. We have expanded our global footprint and increased the diversity of our franchise. Our number of offices is up by more than a third to over 50 with one quarter of our staff located in Bangalore, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Texas. Back in 1999, we had approximately 3,000 people in our technology division. Now we have nearly 8,000. They represent close to a quarter of the firm. We also built an Asset Management business, largely organically, from a few hundred million assets under supervision to 1.15 trillion today. By adapting, we\u2019ve fundamentally improved the strength of our Firm, our opportunity set and as a result our ability to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Going forward, we will make any necessary changes to continue our history of providing superior client service and generating industry leading returns. It\u2019s what our clients, our shareholders and our culture demands. Now just before I take your questions, I\u2019d like to make one additional closing comment about the market environment we\u2019ve seen over the past week and particularly yesterday and this morning. It\u2019s clearly an environment that reminds all of us about the power of investor sentiment and how fragile it can be at times. Yesterday in particular, it was clearly a market in the morning where investors were, quite frankly, shooting first and asking questions later. We've seen this market reaction in the past. And while painful, it\u2019s somewhat a normal part of how markets function. Clearly investors are now debating whether we\u2019ll see lower rates for longer and more importantly whether the global economy is slowing or continuing to grow. These are questions that the market has certainly debated before. We\u2019ve always believed that over the long term markets follow fundamentals. In speaking with our economists only yesterday, they would argue that nothing has fundamentally changed in the past few weeks or certainly the last 24 hours regarding the long-term outlook for the global economy. That doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to grow, but it certainly doesn\u2019t mean it will stall. For us, in any environment, it\u2019s always about staying close to our clients. Yesterday was a difficult day for many of them. Our focus is being there for them. We have the intellectual capital and the financial capital to help address their needs and we remain committed to doing it. With that, I\u2019m happy to take any of your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Hi, thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Good morning. So Investment & Lending continues to do great and the future being what it is with this quarter. But I\u2019m just curious, you mentioned the good IPO market obviously, but if you could break down maybe on the equity side what was realized gains versus marks and then if we\u2019ve seen any changes in the composition of the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets? Harvey Schwartz : There hasn\u2019t been a major shift from the -- if you look at the Investing & Lending balance sheet, you won't see a major shift in terms of the quarter. As you know, the investing and the lending business, it\u2019s a long term business and so you will see changes overtime. Obviously, as I highlighted, we continue to harvest. Part of that is obviously driven by the strength in the market but also part of that is driven by the idiosyncratic strength of the portfolio. And so it continues to perform quite well. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: But no breakdown on realized or unrealized on the equity side? Harvey Schwartz : So it's not a question of realized or unrealized. I mean that's why I am struggling with that point. In terms of when you are talking about things of, for example public versus event driven events, but we've always mark to marketed the portfolio as we work through. And so a good portion of the events over the past quarter were all events and IPOs as I highlighted. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: Okay, good. That's all I was really calling calling towards. Harvey Schwartz : Sorry, I got confused by your wording. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: No worries. I confuse myself too. I appreciate the comment on some of the balance sheet data that everyone is looking for. Maybe just one more thing on total losses absorbing capital, you are at the highs, you have tons and you turned out a lot of your long-term debt. You also have among the highs short-term wholesale funding at last look which the Fed has focused on. And so last quarter you did a bunch of repositioning ahead of CCAR and reducing balance sheet and the repo book. I am assuming that no call-out means no big changes this quarter. But if you could just comment on repo book size, short-term wholesale funding and if any more adjustments are needed? Harvey Schwartz : So at this stage we don't feel there is any adjustment needed. As we highlighted and we focused on in the last quarter, the balance sheet did come down pretty significantly. I will say with respect to the balance sheet, as you know, it\u2019s always going to be dynamic. And we'll always take our cues from the clients in the marketplace. But as you saw in the quarter, it basically went up $9 billion. And when you compare the quarter end to quarter end second quarter to third quarter liquidity pool, basically all of that's in the liquidity pool. So that was any growth in the balance sheet. In terms of the balance sheet, we are going to continuing to remain very disciplined in terms of returns. And as you said, there was no response in terms of the CCAR process last year which drove us to reassess our ROE hurdles that we required and we did that in conjunction with our clients. But we will continue to focus on it. But as you said, the Firm's capital levels and liquidity levels remain quite high. I mean at this stage, 20% of the balance sheet is our liquidity pool. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: All right. Last one is -- I appreciate the comments on the market. In the past, when there were big spikes in volatility, if that happened in a short period of time, that was typically bad for the broker dealer community. But inventories are down like, I don't know, 80%, 90%. I am just curious if big spikes and volatility are less painful this go around given all the changes in broker dealer balance sheets? Harvey Schwartz : So I think the comment with respect to the short-term reaction function as it relates to market volatility. As I mentioned, yesterday, today, particularly difficult days for our clients. And if it's difficult for our clients in the short run, markets can be challenging. And so we always root for good things for our clients and for good markets. We will have to see how this period of volatility translates. If you take a step back and you look at the third quarter, when we came into the third quarter, everybody was focused on the fact that there was absolutely no volatility. And as we here see here today people feel like there is too much. So it's a little bit of too hot, too cold. In September, I think a takeaway from September is that in the right market environments you can really see a huge pickup in client activity and then you can see the operating leverage for us. In terms of the de-risking in terms of the balance sheet that you are seeing across the industry, I don't think that's a 'broker dealer' issue. I think if you look across large global financial institutions and you look at the reduction in risk-weighted assets over the course of the past several years, I think that's a question that we will see overtime as to whether or not that decline in risk carrying capacity along with other adjustments and other regulatory rules, what impact that has ultimately on liquidity for the marketplace. So we will see. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI Group Inc.: I hear you. Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey thanks, Harvey. Harvey, just one thing on the numbers, just in terms of the -- I think you gave the advanced and the standardized and it looks like that might have been the transitional for the general comment. Just wondered if you had the fully phased in? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah. So the fully phased advanced is 10.6%, fully phased standardized is 10%. And I will remind you again that I think maybe it's a midpoint between fully phased and advanced if you were to think about -- sorry, fully phased advanced. And if you think about how our capital ratios migrate as we take investments out of funds, more or less think of it as a midpoint in terms of the long-term projection. That of course if you assume that between now and 2018, the balance sheet was totally static. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's helpful. Harvey Schwartz : Which of course it won't be. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. And then just on composition in the comp ratio, I think the color that you gave is helpful and obviously it's a moving target. When I think about this year, last year, the true-up that you do in the third quarter and then you\u2019re trying to gauge what can happen in the fourth quarter, is there anything that's changing or is this just same process, you\u2019ll see other revenue environment factors in and then you'll readjust the fourth quarter? I just want to make sure the process isn't changing versus what you\u2019ve done in the past. Harvey Schwartz : Well, absolutely no change in the process. I won\u2019t drag you through the underpinning to the process. We've talked about it a lot. But at its core, it\u2019s just paper performance. That\u2019s the philosophy and that\u2019s how we do it. In every quarter we make our best estimate as to the compensation accrual. And I think the extent to which you\u2019re seeing a change, there is no change in process. But you\u2019ve seen a change over the last two years just in our operating leverage and the cost reduction efforts that are coming in. And so this year's accrual reflects the fact that last year\u2019s third quarter looked 25% better year-over-year third quarter-third quarter and we\u2019re running $1.4 billion ahead in revenues. And so that just gives us greater clarity in terms of the compensation levels. But it reflects I think more predominantly the operating leverage that's in the business. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then finally just on -- I guess you went through some of the ratios on all the regulatory changes that we know and then you\u2019re coming up, whether it\u2019s an SVaR, a few factors, things that are ahead, but it also sounds like the industry is doing some things to maybe get in front of that and whether it\u2019s the agreement on derivatives, there was some chat around the repo markets going to CCPs. So I guess on any of these initiatives that are in the works, is there anything that you would point to that might take care of or deal with some of the concerns that the future regulatory items you\u2019re focused on? I know it\u2019s early, so I know typically you don\u2019t want to comment too much until the rules are out there, but just wanted to get your take, because it does seem a little bit different on the industry just trying to get and find out some of these things. Harvey Schwartz : I think it\u2019s a really, really important question. I think that when you look at any one of the rules that in an industry we work with regulators on and regulators have put in place new capital requirements, new liquidity requirements under the LCR, leverage tests, in any one of these rules you could have a very active and heated debate with respect to the molecules in the rule and whether this was calibrated too intentionally. But I don\u2019t think you can debate really the concept of the rule. And so I think in concept most of the rules that we\u2019ve seen make sense and that goes back to the initiatives around clearing swap execution facilities. And I think you have to give the regulators a lot of credit quite frankly for creating an immense amount of regulation and proper regulatory response in giving folks a long time line to adjust to it, very important for our clients and for the capital markets. I think the big open question is, and it's a very, very hard thing for any market participant and regulator to weigh if kind of what\u2019s the collective weight of all of this. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll really be able to assess that until a lot of time passes. I think when it comes to things like the discussions around having repo clearing, I think those are good, healthy market reactions. Generally speaking those are a combination of discussions with clients, because they raise concern, regulators observe, for example increased sales in treasury markets and I think it\u2019s incumbent upon all of us as market participants to be thoughtful and creative about how we make sure that we protect our capital markets. But I do think it\u2019s pretty early days in being able to assess these things. But I think the industry is being very active in trying to make sure that we have the most robust capital markets in the world. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Christian. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the question on Investment & Lending. Debt revenues in particular were robust this quarter and stands out given the backdrop of credit were choppy in the quarter. You mentioned assets sales. I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarter\u2019s revenues and more broadly any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of the long-term that was the debt line, again this is just going to be our approach to how we think about allocating capital and when we see opportunities. So, during the period it\u2019s not so much that a specific asset responding to a particular change in credit spreads in the marketplace, but it will be driven by harvesting over a long period of time. So as companies refinance their capital structures, we may be a beneficiary in that, for example if we\u2019re providing mezzanine level debt to a particular entity. And so that\u2019s why we said that it was driven by many things on investment. And of course there is net interest income in there also which is roughly about $200 million. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just on the investment banking backlogs, you mentioned that remained strong and increased again this quarter. Just curious, do you have any sense of how much of your backlogs that are tied to so called tax inversion deals? Harvey Schwartz : So with respect to the backlog, the backlog again was the highest it's been since 2007. And actually when we look at it, we look at it across the three categories of advisory, equity underwriting and debt underwriting obviously and all categories were up. So that was good to see. It\u2019s not a question of I think inversions in the backlog. When you actually -- when you talk to our M&A team and you actually look at the data either this year over a long period of time, inversion transactions have not been a significant driver of global M&A activity. And really when you get into conversations with the team, what they'll tell you is it's never just about an inversion or a tax benefit, it\u2019s really about the strategic benefits if the two organizations can come together. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just a quick clean up question here. In the earnings release you have referenced high impairment charges in non-comp expenses. Just would be helpful if you could kind of size that on what the nature of those charges relate to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of --. Harvey Schwartz : I didn't hear -- I heard that you referenced non-comp. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of what do you said there? Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : You said higher impairment charges within the non-comp line per your earnings release? Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s not a material number. We just called it out. But as you know, every quarter we mark-to-market the balance sheet and so assets sitting on the balance sheet. But this quarter it wasn\u2019t material, so roughly about $50 million. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : 50 million? Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me. You spoke about strengthening your relative position across all your businesses. I guess the equities business is probably the one place where there has been some market share slip based on reported numbers anyway and I appreciate those numbers. I know it\u2019s really apples-to-apples. But was just curious to -- maybe help us frame Goldman\u2019s competitive position in that business and kind of a longer-term outlook. Harvey Schwartz : So, with respect to longer term outlook and our sense of position in the marketplace, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it. We measure the business by our engagement with clients and our ability to deliver and that\u2019s in the prime brokerage business, in our global footprint, our ability to provide electronic solutions in terms of trading, commit capital and obviously our connectivity with our banking team in terms of driving capital markets transaction. And so from a franchise perspective, we couldn\u2019t feel better about it. Quarter-to-quarter in terms of top line revenue, I know that\u2019s the data that you have available in terms of market share, not really the way we look at market share. We\u2019re much more focused, as I said, on delivering to clients and driving returns to the bottom line at the same time. And so, I think in terms of the long run, we feel quite good. But quarter-to-quarter you may see revenue move back and forth between us and our competitors, but it\u2019s not a big issue for us. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Christian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : You had a pretty big increase in the SLR, I think about 50 basis points versus last quarter and just trying to reconcile what drove that. I think some of it was the assets you actually brought down last quarter that helped the ratio, obviously had positive net income. But was there also a nice benefit from the final SLR rules? Harvey Schwartz : So there were a whole host of things that drove it. We definitely got benefit from the final rules, about 10 basis points. But then when you go through, there was the balance sheet reduction which was [indiscernible]. So as you know, we took the balance sheet down in the second quarter, but it\u2019s daily averaging in the SLR and so you really didn't see that benefit translate through until the third quarter. And then there is other reductions that sort of -- there is other reductions in terms of CDS in the portfolio in terms of that and then obviously there was a capital, we reduced our significant financial institutional deduction, all these things are contributors in terms of driving the increase in ratio. I do think that the SLR is a good example of sort of our philosophy on how we approach regulatory reform. But as you know obviously there has been a significant improvement in that, 70 basis points over a fairly short period of time, and as you point out, 40 basis points in the quarter. We have found that by giving our people the tools, waiting till we see the final rule and then just really focused on complying with the rule, we can move the needle. So, this is just all about compliance. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : And where do you think you are on the optimization of that? Can you talk about obviously as you get compliance for Volcker, there will be a material benefit there. But what about just the other opportunities? You had a list of things with CDS and the other reductions. How much more, if any, is there of that? Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s funny. We don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we're thinking about it \u2013 it's not like a baseball game here in terms of where we are in the innings of how do we comply. I think the takeaway here is that the SLR is not a significant issue. As we talked about a year ago, it\u2019s much more reflective about complying with the rules. But this will be a process that will be ongoing. You mentioned the Volcker compliance. As you come out of the fund, again, we\u2019re talking about something that's forward looking to 2018. And if we can make those adjustments, we'd be well in excess of 5% today. But let\u2019s see how it goes. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just separately on getting compliance for Volcker, there's a lot of focus on that and what it might mean to your equity I&L revenues. But I guess as you think about replenishing the investments with Volcker compliant investments, how is that landscape? Because as I talk to investors, there is some concern that new investment opportunities may not be as good as they\u2019ve been in the past. But what do you think about the outlook for deploying capital in the Volcker compliant manners right now? Harvey Schwartz : So, as we talked about before, there is a number of ways that we can use our capital. And as it comes out of the funds, capital is fungible. And so we will have the ability to continue to invest in Volcker compliant funds, use our balance sheet, other Volcker compliant structures. And so we feel like we have enough flexibility in terms of redeploying that capital. And of course I think this is the critical point. If the opportunities aren't there, obviously we can look to redeploy it into other areas of the firm that demand the capital or we can look to return it to the shareholders. So from that perspective. So for us it's all about the process and the environment. As we discuss the environment as being a good one for harvesting, we have been able to put capital to work in certain parts of the world and our global footprint certainly gives us an advantage in terms of seeing opportunities. But it's always been -- investing and lending has always been a very long-term long cycle initiative and we will be very disciplined about the returns. If the opportunities are there and they make sense, we will deploy the capital. If not, we will be disciplined and we will wait. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And we will probably get it in the 10-Q, but you have the level of direct investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two ago just to show how quickly that's been ramping? Harvey Schwartz : I don't have the year or two ago numbers. Dane can follow up with you offline. But it's been obviously a bit of a high class problem as we've been harvesting, values have been increasing. We can come back to you and get to the numbers. The I&L balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was roughly 71 billion. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank :  Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hey, thanks. That was my questions. I'm good. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Betsy, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Securities services had some pretty attractive quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth. I was wondering if you can just help us understand the dynamic there, especially in the context of what you had done last quarter in terms of bringing down some of the securities funding transactions, second part, of that stuff. Harvey Schwartz : I think what you are seeing there may be the allocation of the gain that I referenced as it related to the retirement of the trust preferred securities. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Oh, got it. It's there. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So as you know, we don't have a corporate cost center. So just a philosophy and a discipline, we allocate out all cost to all the businesses. In this particular case, there was a gain related to funding. So the Institutional Client Services business, the fixed income equity, they are the biggest consumers of balance sheet and liquidity, so they also get the benefit of the gains. And so that's actually really -- I think when you look at it, you will see that that's probably it. We detail it out in the earnings release. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : So that aside then maybe you can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in the second quarter? Harvey Schwartz : So that's a good question. So in terms of how we looked at it, it was really, as I said, I would describe it as a two-part process. One is pretty simple and is mathematical. One of the easiest things to do in terms of response to leverage task is actually just to rank the balance sheet in the businesses from lower ROA to higher ROA. The second part of the exercise is a really high touch exercise where it's engagement in the trenches going through and working with clients and really finding out where we are providing value and where it may need our balance sheet and that's the nuance of the part of the exercise that we went through [indiscernible] and then we will continue to go through. But so far the client engagement [indiscernible] is one of our strongest franchise businesses, so it feels quite good. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Thanks for that. The other question that I had and it goes really back to some of the liquidity points that were being asked about earlier. People have been worried about the impact of the street reducing the liquidity it provides to investors for a while. We heard a lot more about it in the last two weeks of the third quarter. At the same time we know that in the third quarter the [indiscernible] had to begin to make daily reports to regulators based I guess on Volcker and some of the liquidity regs at a pretty deep level of granularity and I was wondering if you felt that this has had any impact broadly on the attractiveness of providing liquidity. Harvey Schwartz : I would say no. It's certainly not a Goldman Sachs and I would imagine not the case across the market, although I don\u2019t have any visibility into our competitors. You are right when you say that the data requirements in the first submission that went in right around Labor Day, it's a pretty significant amount of data. I actually think that speaks to the opposite reaction function and I will tell you why. You can't create that data overnight. We had to invest quite a bit of talent mind share, technology, operations front office time and federation time in building the systems. And so that's been a process that's been underway I would assume for all of our competitors and certainly for us since the rule came out. So it wouldn't be as though you'd show up reporting and somehow you would change your profile. I don\u2019t know, that seems like a stretch to me. I think again it's much more -- it's the collection of the rule sets. We did see increased sales in treasuries, we've seen stress -- and I'm talking about a normal market functioning times, not in stress market functioning times -- definitely where balance sheet has felt scarce. And I think under periods where clients want more liquidity, it may be more difficult to find. But we\u2019ll see how this all shapes out. Again, the impact of the collective rule sets of all the rules, balance sheet, whatever, risk-weighted assets liquidity, it\u2019s pretty enormous and I don\u2019t think we can only have positive effects from that over the next three, four, five, 10 years. I wish that was the case. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And when you add all of that up and going back also to the pricing of securities services and other securities financing transactions, are you in real time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving re-pricing that will be favorable to you presumably? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve never been firm that's first and foremost competed on price. We like to compete on content and we like to compete on the ability to provide liquidity, which may mean being the best price at any point in time for our clients. But our clients understand, they\u2019re very knowledgeable and are increasingly knowledgeable about the regulatory constraints that are on us and really the entire industry where we all have the same rule set. And so as the market responds, I just think everyone needs to be more disciplined and some of that will depend on where your return hurdles are. If our return hurdles are higher than someone else's, then we may be more disciplined than the next market participant I have to say. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Thanks, Harvey. That\u2019s really helpful color. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Just maybe a couple of questions on the regulatory side that I missed it. Did you disclose your LCR or are you over 100% at this point? Harvey Schwartz : We didn\u2019t disclose the number. We\u2019re still digesting all the data as you know. But yes, we\u2019re in excess of the minimum requirement. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : And we would expect given all the focus we've put on liquidity here. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Right. No, that\u2019s fair. And then just maybe a follow-up question on just sort of the Tarullo commentary and the impact and you just talked about how ROE becomes high ROE hurdles. If you think about his focus about wholesale funding potentially a charge on top of the current SIFI charge, he seems to be specifically focused on repo and even the match book. How do you -- do you think is it just too early to start worrying about it because you mentioned you\u2019re not -- you think your balance sheet is fine or do you think is it something that\u2019s going to be an increasingly something you have to focus on and may continue to shrink that market or change the way you do it, just some color there. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : So I think it\u2019s definitely -- and we haven\u2019t even seen a proposed rule and as you know our philosophy around these things is we\u2019ve seen and we will continue to assume that regulators will give the marketplace basically a good glide path to adjust to rule changes. And so we would never react or change the business methodology to commentary. We wait to see the rule. We\u2019d engage in an active dialog on creating a constructive rule. Clearly we\u2019ll be focused on the impact on markets. It would be very interesting to see where this discussion heads. As you know, and I don\u2019t want to address too much, but as you know the SIFI surcharges are really at their core designed around macro prudential regulation, not micro prudential regulation. And so when you look at our proportion of wholesale funding as a percentage of the marketplace, you can argue we're a lot smaller than many of our large universal bank peers. So we'll really see how the rule plays up. But we\u2019ll engage in an active dialog with the regulators just to ensure that we get the most thoughtful rule in investing for the marketplace and our clients. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, fair enough. And maybe just one other quickly on the asset management business. You\u2019ve done a good job in turning around and generating positive flows in fixed income and equities. Is the lack of positive flows in alternatives simply your realizations? And if so, if that\u2019s the case, when do you see -- I assume that\u2019s a higher margin area -- when do you see that kind of inflection point where you start to see net flows turn positive? Harvey Schwartz : Sorry. Could you say that again? Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Well I\u2019m just trying to think of your alternative AUM. Harvey Schwartz : Okay. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Your net flows have been zero, but I assume that's because you have outflows from -- Harvey Schwartz : Yes, we can break it down for you after the call and Dane can give it to you. But basically what you\u2019re seeing there is the harvesting that you\u2019ve seen in the private equity, but you\u2019ve actually seen growth away from that in the other alternative asset categories. But we can break it down for you. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : The growth has been pretty good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Hey, good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, how are you? Brennan Hawken - UBS: Good. Quick question following up on one of Jim\u2019s questions there. So your LCR in excess of the minimum, is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%? Harvey Schwartz : No, sorry, that\u2019s fully phased in. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. Thanks. And then just a question here on the market and sort of your comments to open up the call. Clearly this has been sort of a tough year for hedge funds and October hasn\u2019t been good either. Just thinking about your business and the leverage to financial players, do you think that we could end the year with a real serious withdrawal risk from some of these, some of big portion of your client base? And did that at all impact your decision to adjust the comp ratio here in the third quarter? Harvey Schwartz : No, that's not how we do that. I think the composition was really driven by the improvement in top line revenues and the operating leverage we gained by managing our expenses. I think volatility comes in different flavors. A couple of months ago people were saying volatility will never return to the marketplace. And as I said now people feel like we have too much volatility. And so I think there is healthy periods of volatility and less healthy periods and really what we\u2019ve seen in the last 48 hours is concentrated position, liquidation obviously triggered by stop loss selling in multiple markets. And at times as we\u2019ve always seen, selling can beget selling. Our hedge funds, asset managers and institutional clients are an important part of our focus at Goldman Sachs. But we\u2019ll just stay close to our clients during this period. We don\u2019t think about it in terms of days or weeks, in terms of the performance of our clients. It\u2019s really just a commitment to the long run. Brennan Hawken - UBS: That\u2019s fair. Thanks for that. And then I guess last one for me and it seems like we chat about this every quarter so I wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint you. But I kind of hear you in the equities business that you don\u2019t want to get worked up over quarterly volatility. But it seems as though the equities business on a revenue basis has been losing share for a period in excess of a year. And while it\u2019s certainly encouraging that engagement with clients remains solid, when do you think that that translates into revenue? And I guess when do you become concerned that the engagement is there ultimately to lead the revenue? So, when do you become concerned about that not translating, I guess? Harvey Schwartz : So, look, it\u2019s an important question. And as I said before, we run the business for a focus on our clients and then ultimately margins and returns. In any given quarter quarter-to-quarter you can see noise. In this quarter \u2013 again I don't have visibility into our competitors -- in this quarter we certainly, as I mentioned in the [earnings release] (ph) we had a more challenging part of a cash business and equities client institution, so a bit more challenging for us in blocks. Again, I don\u2019t have visibility. But I think if you step back and you look at Goldman Sachs, I think actually you\u2019re seeing it translate into returns. So, when you eliminate for the quarter an 11.2% ROE for the year-to-date, I think we\u2019re doing whatever we can actually to drive to the bottom line. So I think, I actually think you are seeing it. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. Thanks, Harvey. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Hey, Harvey. Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey. Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak - Nomura: So my first question pertains to the topic of operational risk. And digging into some of the Pillar 3 disclosures for you and your peers and if you\u2019re thinking of actually running at a much lower level as a percentage of RWA at roughly 15% I believe, at least as of Q2, which compares to the remaining universals or at least U.S. domiciled universals running closer to 25 to 30, I don\u2019t know if you can clarify because that calculation is really determined based on the industry rather than company specific event risk, what\u2019s driving that delta? Harvey Schwartz : So, you\u2019re right to say we have less. But I think it really correlates more to the fact that we\u2019re just a less complex financial institution than many of our peers. We don\u2019t have the payment systems, we don\u2019t have the consumer banking side of the business, we don\u2019t have that like a lot of our universal peers have. And also as you know this was also driven by loss experience. And when you look at our loss experience over the last several years, it\u2019s been significantly lower than many of our peers. I think that it\u2019s a pretty straightforward answer. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay, fair enough. And then just switching gears over to I&L. We\u2019ve been having more conversations with investors which suggest continued reluctance to ascribe as much value to the contributions simply given a lack of earnings visibility tied to the portfolio again, which at least from my point of view I'd argue it dilutes the contribution from some sustainable fee streams you have there because of lending tied to the private banks. I didn't know given the lack of credit that some have been willing to ascribe to merchant banking and the portfolio gains whether you'd consider updating or amendments to your segment disclosure, at least within I&L, to at the very least disaggregated the merchant banking portion from higher multiple and sustainable revenue streams tied to lending activities. Harvey Schwartz : So, maybe I think let's step back for a second. So in terms of how we think about the Investing & Lending businesses, if you look back over the history of time -- and again we approach this over the long term -- it\u2019s been a significant builder of book value and certainly a valuable contribution the way that we've partnered with clients over many many years and we do think we have some competitive advantages in that business in terms of our global footprint and ability to source transactions. And so I think its economic value in terms of its contribution as the margin you can see and it speaks for itself. I think it\u2019s pro-cyclical. So there is always a discussion about its value in different times of a cycle. But we run it as a pro-cyclical business. And so, I think the question of financial statement presentation I\u2019m happy to take offline with you and Dane. As you know we went through a very thorough review as part of our business standards committee process to actually design our financial statements in a way that actually provide an increased clarity around the various business lines. But we\u2019re always looking to improve that clarity. And so \u2013 look, I think we\u2019re better for having this financial disclosure. At the time we got very positive feedback for it. I don\u2019t want to close and be [quippy] (ph) with you, but yeah, do I think generally speaking the marketplace is undervalued than Goldman Sachs' business, yes. But I don't if it's necessarily the result of the financial statements, but we are happy to look at it. Harvey Schwartz : All right, fair enough. No, I appreciate the color, Harvey, and thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Good morning, Matt. Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you certainly had some nice improvement in the SLR ratio quarter-over-quarter. Have you said or disclosed what buffer you might have ultimately above the 5% target that everybody is focused on? We have several conversations with investors trying to guess that or estimate that for various companies. Harvey Schwartz : Yeah. No, we haven't focused on a buffer yet. Remember that the balance sheet is very dynamic. And so as we comply with the rule and you can see we are making significant progress, but we haven't determined any buffer and obviously we have a couple of years. Again, I will underscore that as we take our investments out of funds, if you were actually to translate those same assets onto the balance sheet, that gets us to a 5.2, 5.3 level anyway. So there is almost a natural tailwind that creates that. But we will constantly reassess and define all these buffers as we get all the final rules. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned the backlog being so strong and as a combination of a number of different businesses and I am going to ask -- when you talk to the folks particularly in the fixed income side of banking, if the rates actually do go up at some point, how are they thinking about potential future global debt issuance in a period of rising rates given that there has been so much issuance over the past few years at declining rate? I realize it's hard to figure out given the nature of the business tends to focus in many ways and sort of drive by issuance, but how are they thinking about the potential for that type of volume over the next couple of years? Harvey Schwartz : Look, my crystal ball on these kind of things has never been particularly good. So remember it was a year plus ago we were getting asked questions when we first hit a new record in debt underwriting a year plus ago about the end of the debt underwriting cycle. And so, and again in the second quarter we had another record this year. So very difficult to predict. I think a lot of it depends on the environment associated around the rate increases. I think if it's again a return to normalized rates around the globe where we don't have so much incredible essential bank intervention and that's associated with global growth, I think you could see growth in many economies around the world, I think you will see an increase in capital markets activity because you will see companies want to issue debt as they grow, as they move away from being financed by local banks. So I think it will be environment centric. If you saw -- part of what we've seen is you see large M&A transactions and the M&A environment is quite active, you see a lot of related debt issuance. So I definitely think there is something of a reaction function over short periods of times to rate levels, I think a lot of it will be correlated with global growth. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks very much. And then just a follow-up for me. The 9 billion of the remainder of investments, Volcker related investments you need to move out of overtime, it sounds like that number really hasn't changed much since the second quarter. Is that what we should understand from your earlier comments? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, that's right. It's actually right around 8 billion now. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities :  Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan - JMP Securities : Most of my questions have been asked. But maybe just a question on acquisitions and now that we are getting a little bit better picture on the capital and regulatory framework. When you think about where you'd like to expand the business over the next several years, does the door open more to thinking about doing acquisitions or really is there anything that could become more interesting kind of growing inorganically as you guys think about the go forward? Harvey Schwartz : Look, I think we are the leading merger and acquisition advisory firm in the world. It would be some inconsistent philosophically for us. I just think it would be inconsistent with our core being if we say we weren't willing to consider acquisitions. And so I think you should assume philosophically and culturally that as a management team we'd consider any acquisition if it was accretive in any area of our firm. I do think that as you point out, I do think that the ongoing nature of the regulatory environment probably just makes them more difficult for the industry generally. But we will see overtime. But we are always open minded. And having said all that, I think we've benefited as a firm over many years by keeping our culture intact and doing nothing major. But you've seen us do bolt-on acquisitions from time-to-time. So that's how I'd describe it philosophically. Devin Ryan - JMP Securities : Okay, helpful. And then just I guess staying on the M&A theme, just as you mentioned being the leader. When you look at the backlog, are you seeing further divergence around trends within the U.S. and Europe and particularly given I guess maybe the divergence is in the economies right now? Or does this feel like the European M&A backlog and what you are guys are seeing over there in terms of the outlook is pulling off the bottom? I know the U.S. has kind of led the charge there? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of \u2013 there's nothing really material to share with you in terms of the shape of the geographic backlog. As you know, merger transaction is the most significant decision a CEO, his or her management team and a board makes in a life cycle of a company. And so these decisions tend to come into place over many, many years in terms of how they\u2019re executed. At the margin, obviously markets can drive thinking. Sentiment has been a big factor a couple of years ago in preventing transactions from happening. And then when sentiments shifted, you've obviously seen a huge uptick in activity. But there is nothing I would comment on with respect to global activity. Certainly growth, if we see big disparity in growth around the globe, that may be an influencer, but there's nothing to share with you today. Devin Ryan - JMP Securities : Okay. All right, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, good morning. Operator : Marty, your line is open. Please check to see if it's on mute. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Well, there we go. Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : I want to make sure that as we looked at the comp ratio, when we typically get these adjustments as we get towards the end of the year which you\u2019re saying reflect operational improvements and efficiencies, is there any thought about permanently kind of incorporating this throughout the year so that it seems more sustainable and less kind of temporary and year-end adjustment? Harvey Schwartz : Again, there is no change in philosophy on how we\u2019ll this. It\u2019s always going to be a quarter-to-quarter assessment. It\u2019s our best estimate for where we stand at that particular point in the year. And as I said, it reflects all the factors you\u2019ve heard us talk about. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting, the regulatory pressure on leverage lending and maybe some impact there. Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward given the stance that we\u2019ve seen talked about openly by the regulators? Harvey Schwartz : So the comment I made about leverage actually didn\u2019t have anything to do with that. That was actually just transaction specific quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned, the backlog was up at the end of the third quarter across all categories. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : Specifically what you\u2019re talking about though, it would be interesting to see how that will evolve. I know market participants, regulators, certainly all those at Goldman Sachs are very focused on the compliance with that and that will be very interesting to see over the next couple of years what impact that has in terms of markets where those transactions get financed, at what leverage levels, and that will be evolving story, we\u2019ll keep eye on. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And then lastly, the $0.05 dividend increase, while still in that kind of 10% range. Your earnings have grown much higher than that over the last year, revenues were up much more than that, excess capital was abundant, your payout ratio is low and your dividend yield is still relatively low. So seems like you had come headroom to maybe potentially go up a little bit more than that. I just didn't know what what your thought was there. Harvey Schwartz : So when we assess capital return, as you know our preferred mechanism for capital return is really from share repurchase. We think it allows us to be very dynamic in terms of responding to our clients' needs and market conditions. And so while the dividend has certainly come up meaningfully, I think you should still assume that Goldman Sachs will rely on share repurchase as its predominant tool. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Got you. And humor me for one more question. If we look at the market commentary you said with the pain and the volatility coupled with the kind of regulatory Volcker kind of compliance move and your VaR coming down, do you feel like as a market maker you're kind of hamstrung in ability to kind of help the market go through some of these transitions now given all the new regulations? Harvey Schwartz : I just want to be clear with that. You may have misheard me or I may have misheard you. There was nothing that I saw about Volcker compliance that I think is at this stage preventing people from providing liquidity. Volcker has been pretty visible for a while now. The comment I was making is that it\u2019s very hard to assess the collective impact of leverage rules, increases in risk-weighted assets reductions in balance sheet globally in terms of the entire industry and what that means for market liquidity. And we\u2019ve certainly seen areas where people \u2013 I haven't looked at all the data, but most firms at this stage have actually shrunk their match books. I think I\u2019m pretty accurate in saying that. And so all market participants, regulators included, have been asking themselves the question of when we were seeing increases in sales and treasuries whether how much of that was driven by market makers' inability or lack of appetite or not being able to position balance sheet in terms of providing that liquidity at important times. We'll have to see again how all this evolves. When you look at Goldman Sachs today given the level of our capital ratios, which I described earlier in the call, we certainly have the capacity to deliver for our clients when they need it. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW: Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW: Just quick question, when you look at some of the regulations coming down the road here and also funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR, both of those would benefit from a greater level of deposit funding on the balance sheet in effect. Are you thinking about growing deposits currently? And if you are, kind of are you thinking about organically or through acquisition or are you just not going to think about it at all? Harvey Schwartz : So we obviously focus on -- I think in the context at the moment, this will be very interesting because, you mentioned NSFR so let's just use that as an example. I think as an example of a rule and a concept, I think again that falls into the bucket of a good concept because you want good asset liability management across the industry. We spend a huge amount of time on asset liability management the way that we look at secure funding and how we manage our balance sheet and we run a very conservative profile in terms of how we manage that. With respect in this rule, it will be very interesting because we haven\u2019t even seen the Basel rule yet. I think the big question will be again, when you add this rule on to other rules if there are some long term impact on market liquidity so obviously clients and we will be very focused on that. As this goes to the rule-making process because you specifically make just a deposit, it will be very interesting when you get to the U.S. because as you know in the U.S. it\u2019s a different legal structure in terms of your ability to use deposit funding for certain businesses. And so not only do we need to wait to see the Basel rule, but then we\u2019ll need to see the U.S. rule and how they incorporate just a different legal structure that exists in the U.S. So we\u2019ll have to see how it goes. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW: Okay. And just a separate question on the ECM backlog. Is there any specific reason that\u2019s kind of driving strength there? I think you said last quarter Europe was strong in underwriting but this quarter has that changed? Harvey Schwartz : No, it's just a normal part of the marketplace in terms of people coming to the markets and raising capital for a variety of needs. But there is no key driver. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW: Okay, great. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : So again, since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of the senior management will get to see you many of you in the coming months. Certainly if there is any additional questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. And otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Look forward to speaking with you on the fourth quarter call. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Andrew Limb - Societe Generale Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm\u2019s control. The Firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2013. I\u2019d also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and Global Core Excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site at www.gs.com.

Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm\u2019s results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full-year results. Then I\u2019m obviously happy to answer any questions. Briefly on the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.7 billion. Net earnings were $2.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.38. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $34.5 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, earnings per diluted share of $17.07 and a return on common equity of 11.2%. Revenues were roughly consistent with last year. We grew net earnings by 5%, book value per share by 7%, and earnings per diluted share by 10%. If we take a step back and assess 2014, there have been challenges to the global economy and therefore the operating environment for our clients. We have seen a global economy that has been grinding itself towards growth. Different countries are naturally at different stages of the economic cycle and the interconnectedness of these different economies has made the transition to growth somewhat extended, choppy, and oftentimes unpredictable. Having a global client footprint means that we\u2019re impacted by both global and regional fluctuations. Most importantly, it also means that we're a diversified enterprise. The consistency of our annual revenues is a testament to both the products and geographic diversity of our operations, and the stability they collectively provide. Weakness in Asia or Europe can be offset by strength in the U.S. Headwinds in institutional client services can be offset by strength in investment banking or investment management. Ultimately, our shareholders own a combination of industry-leading global businesses that have collectively generated superior returns. We've also achieved our results in the face of significant regulatory change. The financial services industry and our Firm specifically, have been responding to unprecedented levels of new regulation. The regulators and the industry have done a tremendous amount of work here and as a result have made the system stronger, and significantly safer. Since 2012, we undertook several strategic initiatives to respond to new regulations and at the same time derisk the firm. This included a $55 billion balance sheet reduction over the past year. In addition, we sold our Americas reinsurance business, we sold our European insurance business and we liquidated our investment in ICBC. Along with those actions, we also sold our hedge fund administration business and our ready platform. In 2012, the businesses and investments that I just listed produced $2.3 billion in revenue. As a result, since then we had to replace in excess of $2 billion of revenues in 2014 just to match 2012 levels. As I said, the last three years have required us to adapt and source new revenue opportunities at attractive returns. Between 2012 and 2014, investment banking and investment management generated $2.4 billion of incremental revenues. This achievement demonstrates the strength of our client franchise, the diversity of our operations, the commitment and quality of our people and our culture of adaptability. Now I\u2019ll discuss each of our businesses starting with Investment Banking. Before digging into the details here, it\u2019s worth noting a few achievements from 2014. We were number one in M&A, advising on more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. We also ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A decline in underwriting activity offset a pick up in completed M&A. For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $6.5 billion, up 8% from 2013 on the back of a significant improvement in advisory revenues and modestly higher equity underwriting revenues. This was slightly offset by lower debt underwriting revenues following record results in 2013. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $692 million; the 16% increase relative of the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Walgreen\u2019s $15.3 billion acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, Royal KPN\u2019s 8.4 billion euro of E-plus to Telefonica, Deutschland and Athlon Energy\u2019s $7.1 billion sale to Encana. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including Allergan\u2019s $66 billion sale to Actavis, Baker Hughes $38 billion sale to Halliburton and Talisman Energy\u2019s $13 billion sale to Repsol. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $748 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% sequentially with both equity and debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $342 million, were down 20% compared to third quarter results largely due to a decrease in secondary offerings and private placements. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 9% to $406 million due to a significant decline in leverage finance activity. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Becton Dickinson\u2019s $7.2 billion financing to support their purchase of CareFusion, ICBC\u2019s $5.6 billion debt offering and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s $4 billion common stock and convertible offering. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its highest level since 2007. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, down 17% compared to the third quarter. For the full-year, $15.2 million of net revenues were down 3% relative to 2013. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and include a $55 million of DVA gains. Excluding DVA, and last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender, revenues were down 41% sequentially as certain businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions. Interest rates were lower sequentially as client activity declined amid a challenging environment. Credit decreased as the market was characterized by widening high-yield spreads and low levels of liquidity. Mortgages declined versus the third quarter, as volatility and client activity were generally low. While currencies was lower than a very robust third quarter, volatility remain high and client activity were still solid. Even higher volatility and energy markets, commodities improved sequentially and were supported by stronger client activity levels. For the full-year, FICC client execution net revenues were $0.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender, and the impact of the 2013 European Insurance sale, revenues were down 5% relative to 2013. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.9 billion, up 21% sequentially and included $27 million in DVA gains. Equities Client Execution revenues increased 75% sequentially to $751 million due to a more favorable backdrop with higher equity prices and increased client activity. Commissions and Fees were $829 million, up 11% relative to the third quarter supported by an increase in client volumes. Security Services generated net revenues of $351 million, up 2% sequentially adjusting for last quarter\u2019s gain related to our trust preferred tender. For the full-year, equities produced net revenues of $6.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Excluding DVA, the gain related to our trust preferred tender and the 2013 sale of our reinsurance business, results were down 4% relative to 2013. Turning to risk. Average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $63 million, down from $66 million in the third quarter with the largest decrease coming from interest rates. Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities. Collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $982 million, primarily reflecting company specific events including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $358 million, which was relatively balanced between net interest income and net gains on certain investments. Other revenues of $192 million include the Firm\u2019s consolidated investments. In the fourth quarter, we sold our investment in Metro International. For the fourth quarter and full-year, Metro contributed $70 million and $325 million respectively to other revenues. For the full-year, Investing and Lending generated net revenues of $6.8 billion, driven by $3.8 billion in gains from equity securities, $2.2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans and $847 million of other revenues. In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 7% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $200 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 1% sequentially to a record $1.23 billion. For the full-year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6 billion, up 11% from 2013 on record management and other fees which benefited from growth in our assets under supervision. During the fourth quarter assets under supervision increased $28 billion to a record $1.18 trillion, due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full-year basis, we have long-term fixed income inflows of $58 billion and equity inflows of $15 billion. Alternative inflows were $1 billion and included $6 billion from fund of funds offset by net outflows from other private equity and credit funds. Moving to our performance, across the globe, 83% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis. And 75% ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remain roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2014 and translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 36.8%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 11% higher than the third quarter, reflecting $137 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full-year, non-compensation expenses were down 4%, primarily due to lower provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses. Total staff at year-end was approximately 34,000, up 3% from year-end 2013. Our effective tax rate was 31.4% for 2014. Our global core excess liquidity end of the quarter at $183 billion. Our Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% using the advanced approach. It was 11.3% under the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished the quarter at 5%. The Firm is now compliant with the 2018 minimum. We repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion during the quarter. For the full-year, we repurchased $5.5 billion helping to reduce our average fully delivered share count by 26 million shares year-over-year. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter and paid out approximately $1 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we return $6.5 billion of capital to shareholders while at the same time continuing to grow our regulatory capital ratios. Now before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. Looking back on our performance in 2014, the Firm continued to execute on its operating strategy. We remain committed to our clients, providing superior service and execution which is central to building any long-term relationship. The strength of our client franchise is reflected in our returns and our leading market position. For example, we ended the year as the global leader M&A with more than $1 trillion in announced transactions. This is nearly $250 billion greater than our next closest competitor. We were ranked first in global equity, and equity related and common stock offerings for 2014. We helped deliver nearly $300 billion in equity capital from our investing clients to our corporate clients. We executed more than 2 billion transactions for our institutional investing clients across equities, fixed income, currencies, and commodities. And we\u2019re the trusted investment manager for in excess of $1 trillion in assets. Our track record of performing for our clients has translated into a leading market position within each of our businesses. Another area of focus has been on our efficiency, well operating efficiency and capital. We announced an expense initiative from a position of strength in 2011. We believe this was an important step, which positioned us to remain externally focused over the past three years. Continued discipline on compensation levels and focus on non-compensation expenses has contributed to 300 basis points of pre-tax margin expansion since 2012. Our capital philosophy is also clear. Having a strong capital base, not only allows our firm to be front footed in helping our clients capturing opportunities, but also provides protection in more difficult operating environments. The existence of multiple capital regulations has materially increased the need for robust capital planning tools. To try better capital efficiency and comply with new regulatory requirements, we\u2019ve developed critical technology and operating infrastructure to inform our allocation decisions. While they can never replace good judgment, these tools certainly help to inform it. In closing, Goldman Sachs is essentially made up of our clients, your capital, and our people. Our Firm stands ready to use its financial and intellectual capital to serve our clients through this evolving period in the global economy. We are committed to consistently delivering the Firm and its entirety to our clients and maximizing our impact. And we\u2019re equally committed to generating superior returns for our shareholders through the cycle. Thank you again for dialing in. And now I'm happy to answer any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. First one on Investing and Lending. You had mentioned that there are a bunch of sales inside the equity piece. Would you mind just updating us on what\u2019s left in the book equity wise that eventually has to be liquidated for Goldman? And in conjunction with that, have you been replacing on balance sheet to backfill? Harvey Schwartz : So we will just take a step back. You remember from the third quarter, the Investing and Lending balance sheet was roughly $76 billion, which broke down roughly 14 -- $4 billion of public equity, $18 billion of private equity and the balance really -- the vast majority of the balance sheet in that north of $50 billion. And so in terms of the -- in the equity line, I think what you\u2019re continuing to see is just really the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. We\u2019ve guided you over time that over long periods the portfolio will correlate with the MSEI [ph] or other public indices and -- but there will still be times where we will outperform that or under-perform that. And in this particular quarter, there were -- really the vast majority of the gains in the portfolio were driven by things that we refer to as event driven. So it was either the potential for very near-term IPO we took something public where there was a refinancing event. We don\u2019t look at this of course on a quarterly basis, but you will remember I highlighted to you in the last quarter that when we\u2019ve taken Mobileye public it had contributed $285 million in revenues and that would be an example of something that it was down during the course of the quarter, that was down a bit more than $70 million. In terms of reinvesting and the portfolio, our strategy here is unchanged in terms of our philosophy, in terms of how we think about the capital. Where we can deploy capital to our clients and where we can find attractive returns, then we will pursue them, but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about the kind of returns that we can gain out of the marketplace. And so you will continue to see us do this one good thing in the quarter that you saw was that the regulators finalized the extension of the Volcker Rule and so there will be two one year extension there. So that was good to see as -- I think it was thoughtful by the regulators, because it will -- would have otherwise we might have seen fire sales across the marketplace. Glenn Schorr : And equity left, Goldman\u2019s equity piece left? I think it went from 9 to 8 to 6, if my memory serves me correctly. Where are we at now? Harvey Schwartz : So are you talking about sort of -- there is two things that sometimes I didn\u2019t get [indiscernible]. I think if you\u2019re firmly [indiscernible] where the -- our investment is in terms of the private equity portfolio that was -- we were discussing under Volcker before the extensions, that\u2019s roughly around $8 billion. There was some harvesting, but that was offset by some gains. Again, now that\u2019s an extended two years. If you're talking about the significant financial institution reduction which is a separate number that relates to our Basel III capital ratios, that\u2019s now roughly about $5 billion. Glenn Schorr : Okay, perfect. That's what I was looking for. Harvey Schwartz : Sorry, I wasn\u2019t sure exactly. I probably should have gotten there faster. Glenn Schorr : No, I probably should have worded it better. So then a big picture question, a couple of quarters ago, we are all bumming out that every volatility chart points down. Now rates, volatility, oil volatility, FX volatility, credit volatility all thumbs up, and all the banks get beaten up on inventories that we thought were a lot less. So could we talk about good vol versus bad vol and what we are supposed to root for? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, it\u2019s I don\u2019t know it\u2019s a little -- I guess it\u2019s -- what is it? Is it a Goldilocks? Its too cold, its too hot? We can\u2019t find the right temperature. I think when you look -- I find it very interesting to sort of juxtapose the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because I think it really highlights what you\u2019re saying. We came into the third quarter and as you said everybody bemoaning knew the fact that there was nothing happening in the world in July and then we got into the summer doldrums of August. And then we came back and foreign exchange was very active. There was a lot of momentum and you saw big uptick in client activity in certain parts of the business. Now we come into the fourth quarter and I don\u2019t know if you want to call it unhealthy volatility, but in October we had our -- whatever you want to refer to in markets, now referred to as the Treasury Flash Crash. And then, Greece, the continuation of Russia, a huge decline in the oil price, which of course it started in June, but nearly came into frame in the fourth quarter which weighed heavily on credit markets. And so, I don't think when you look back in the fourth quarter, any of this should be particularly surprising. When you see that much pressure on credit markets, in terms of the ability as a market maker on the course of the quarter, to manage liquidity, I don\u2019t think its particularly surprising, particularly the stress that came under high-yield as a result of the energy decline. Now for us, there were some real bright spots in the quarter in fixed income, which is why we think about it long-term, we will tell you that the energy price has been declining, our ability to be an active and valuable provider of hedging solutions that a market maker do are energy sensitive and commodity sensitive clients. Was it\u2019s a kind of thing you really see. But it's not always going to be case that in a given quarter, I need to pretty unique events we\u2019re talking about. But again, in the end it\u2019s all going to be driven by the client activity, client uncertain types of volatility will drive more client activity. And certain will make people want a recede and be a little more protective. I know we\u2019re all focused on it, but quarter over quarter when you think of the events; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprising actually. Glenn Schorr : Then the follow-on on that is just, in credit specifically, which is probably the most liquidity-dependent. Do the desks themselves, or do your risk management practices, do you tend to exit positions during times of stress like that or should we be thinking about you are sitting on the same kind of book right now, just at lower prices? Harvey Schwartz : So we\u2019re always managing the risk components of many of our books, regardless of the environment. And the kind of market that we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s really very natural on what they\u2019re doing at the desk level. So they\u2019re obviously fulfilling their client responsibilities in terms of making market, but it can be particularly challenging from time to time. But again, this is a long-term commitment. I wouldn\u2019t say that there were any significant support, exposures, in terms of that we are really focused on. But obviously things that have been in frame for a while Russia, Greece, energy whatever the case might be. Obviously we pay a lot of attention to those things. Again, as we\u2019ve said in the past Glenn, it's a moving business not a storage business. And just sometimes moving is harder. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. My times up, thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Glenn. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Mike. Michael Carrier : Hi. Harvey, just upfront you mentioned a lot of the businesses that have been repositioned. I think you mentioned the $2.3 billion on the revenue side. I guess when we look at 2015, near now that most of the rules are finalized; I guess is the vast majority of the repositioning out of the way? I guess because when I look at the ratios, you're basically where you need to be. So should we see ongoing like revenue headwinds, or is the repositioning mostly through? Michael Carrier : So look we will have to see as all the rules ultimately get finalized. There is still a number of rules out there, but so I\u2019d say things that we very deliberately did in terms of derisking the firm or responding to regulatory requirements like the sales of the insurance business, the other things I listed, there is nothing right now that we\u2019re looking at you should expect to see in the near-term. Having said that, these businesses have always been dynamic, they will remain dynamic and over the next many years things will continually evolve and we look to be very dynamic in all of those businesses, whether they\u2019re market structure changes, whether they\u2019re things like we\u2019ve seen in terms of regulatory driven. I mean it just -- I think this is what you need to do to manage the business as well. So we will continue to focus on capital and make sure we\u2019re using the capital as efficiently and effectively as possible, all these things are just part of daily life. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it. And then just maybe on the same topic, or somewhat related to it, just in terms of your Tier 1 ratio going up to 12.2, if you can give us the components. It looks like RWA shrunk in the quarter, but just want to know what drove that, and then going forward is there anything else in the pipeline? Harvey Schwartz : So in the third quarter [indiscernible] it went up to 12/2 as I referenced. So on the -- if you really want to break that down into the molecules, give or take roughly 10 basis points came from just growth in capital. Another 10 basis points came from various steps we\u2019re taking in terms of managing the capital better and then the balance -- really it was about risk reduction and it was much driven by the drop off in client activity towards the end of the quarter than anything else. So you could see this bounce back. In terms of staff again, we\u2019re going to continue to adjust all the capital rules, and as I said we\u2019ve invested heavily in getting the tools out and as we discussed at your conference, we now have a uniform framework that we\u2019re deploying across the Firm in terms of that how we think about best utilizing their capital ensuring that we position it most effectively for all of our clients and so, again that\u2019s going to be, I don\u2019t know if you want to call part of the new world, but that\u2019s part of the world that we live in now. Michael Carrier : Got it. And then, last one, just given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing both in the oil markets, more recently in the FX market. Just want to get, your guys perspective of obviously you mentioned on the commodity side that can present same opportunities in terms of more activity. On the flipside is lot of risk associated with that, depending on what happens, just want to see how you guys are managing that risk. In the quarter, was there anything significant particularly in the FICC, just because it was a little lighter than expected. That weight on any of the segments. Harvey Schwartz : So as I said in the quarter, it really was a tough quarter in the credit business, also when mortgages on a relative basis, but more pronounced in the credit business areas. In terms of the commodity businesses, I think it\u2019s almost worth taking a step back. If you think about over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve often been asked a question hey, it seems like everybody else is getting out of the commodity business. How come you\u2019re not getting out of the commodity business? And for sure commodities have been quite for a little while and we\u2019ve got -- you remember we got that question pretty frequently and the answer give us a pretty straightforward which is when we dealt with our clients we knew the business of hedging, managing their risks, investing in clients. We knew that was an important part of what they did and it ties very nicely into our investment banking franchise where we provided advice and capital to all those clients. And so, I know it\u2019s a bit of a reminder when you see the fourth quarter where you see a pick up in performance that reinforces that you which really need to listen to your clients when you\u2019re thinking about your strategy in terms of the businesses that you invest in and those businesses you protect across the cycle. And so, part of the consistency that you\u2019ve seen from us is the investment in these various businesses across a long cycle. It might be commodities. A couple of years ago, people were talking about the fact that merger were never coming back. And so from a commodity perspective, in terms of risk, our risks are quite manageable to the sector. You would asked that also, so I just want to finish with that. Michael Carrier : Okay. Sounds good. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning. Thanks for dialing in. Christian Bolu : Thank you. Just on the Outlook for 2015, in your press release earlier this morning, Lloyd struck an optimistic tone speaking to seeing evidence of a pick up in a global economy that will improve the opportunity set for 2015? Could you be a bit more specific and speak to how you see that improved opportunity set a evolving on a business by business basis. So I will give you my perspective on that. When you talk to the economists inside Goldman Sachs, the general view whether you\u2019re talking about the U.S which clearly have a more optimistic view in terms of growth. Europe, Asian, is generally positive and as I said its more of a continue grinding forward. And so, if we see continued stability in terms of market, normalization of interest rates and really fundamentally steady growing GDP. Those are the things that are historically over cycles. Have translated well for us, because it contributes to global confidence and global confidence contributes to activity. And so, it kind of gets back to the theme I started with earlier which is -- in over the last couple of years, we\u2019re ourselves have made adjustment in an environment which has been choppy as I said and also a bit on event and what we needed to do is, we needed replace significant revenues and so you see what we\u2019re doing to the extent which we hopefully will have fewer revenues replaced in the future. Hopefully this will translate into growth. But, again it\u2019s all going to be driven by the environment. That\u2019s the one thing we can\u2019t control. We can just respond it. Christian Bolu : Okay. On the equities business, I apologize if I missed this in your prepared remarks. But just curious as to what drove the strength in the equity kind of execution line? Harvey Schwartz : So for a couple of quarters, I know you were focused on, it looks a little lower. In this particular quarter, there were some very solid opportunities to provide capital declines and volumes but again when you look across the equity business, when we see uptick in client activity and when you see trending prices, the strength of a franchise really comes to the front whether its in prime brokerage client execution or commissions and fees. Christian Bolu : Okay. Sounds like its a little more lumpy than you would normally expect for the quarter. Harvey Schwartz : There is some seasonality in there, there is some rebalances that we participated in some other things, but again these are one time event. They\u2019re just annual event. They haven\u2019t drilled the course of the year. Christian Bolu : Okay. And then just lastly for me a quick clean up question. Under sale of Metro, you noted $325 million in revenues last year. What kind of costs came with those revenues? Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s a very small contributor to pre-tax. Christian Bolu : Perfect. Harvey Schwartz : You shouldn\u2019t think of it as meaningful at all in pretext terms. Christian Bolu : Perfect. Thank you, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Okay. Thank you. Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with COSA. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Mike. Michael Mayo : Given the big movement, the Swiss franc there is some reports that banks lost some big money, specifically what happened this week. Can you comment and then more generally, how would this impact to your move towards electronic trading of FX? Harvey Schwartz : So well, first of all, in terms of Goldman Sachs, immaterial from an economic perspective. So you\u2019re only worried about that, there is noting there. I will say what we all witnessed yesterday is pretty extraordinary. I haven't confirmed any stats , but just going to with some of the folks, the single largest move in a day of any developed country, I think it was something like a 20 plus standard deviation move. I think it was like after three plus years of 2% volatility. So you\u2019re right to call it extraordinary, but again no issues here. For us it really is an opportunity, really for very high-level engagement with clients who both need liquidity and then the longer term questions about working with local corporates who had an immediate shift in competitiveness and what does that mean? So there\u2019ll be obviously a long-term focus. In terms of each rating, there\u2019s only things you take away from these or I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll potentially be some lessons learned, but I don\u2019t necessarily have any major takeaways. It certainly doesn\u2019t change our investments largely in terms if you think about each rating. Michael Mayo : And then one other question, you mentioned the 300 basis point pre tax margin improvement since 2012. I have to imagine it might get tougher if revenues don\u2019t grow more. What are some additional levers you have for pre tax margin? You\u2019ve got a lot on non-comp and you certainly have done a lot on comp. Is there any more to go? Harvey Schwartz : So, well first of all Mike I appreciate acknowledging our effort on expansion because it has been really a multi-year effort in terms of being disciplined. Again it\u2019s going to be environment driven. Right now when we look at the global footprint, we feel really, really well positioned in terms of our geographic footprint and our product footprint. But we\u2019re committed to staying very focused on expenses. You\u2019re not going to see us take the foot off here, and so, we\u2019ll see. The big thing that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve in the last couple of years as we\u2019ve talked about a lot is putting an operating leverage. And while we\u2019ve replaced the two plus billion dollars in revenues over the last couple of years, it would be great we\u2019d all like to see the environment being one that provided another couple of billion dollars in revenues, and we think we have that operating leverage. So we feel well positioned. Michael Mayo : All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: If I can first follow up on the expense question, maybe just trying to get a little more detail in terms of the opportunity from here. I think you and a lot of other firms have a relocation strategy trying to bring down some of the especially back office and non-sales facing costs. Maybe if you could just kind of frame it the opportunity there; I think a lot of people also look at the state of raw and think those opportunities to become less top heavy and then obviously there\u2019s the new structural reduction in comp that does contribute it. So, maybe just pushing a little bit on where you can go from here on expenses? Harvey Schwartz : So as part of the expense probably from the last couple of years, and it\u2019s a great question. As you know, we have been diversifying ourselves geographically in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore and others and it represent about 25% of the firm\u2019s headcount at this stage give or take. I think there is continued opportunity. One thing I\u2019ll say which is, something at this stage which is hard to quantify, but we\u2019re looking to take a leadership role in which is, over the next several years as you really get all these rules in place around all the various training venues around the world. There certainly will be a need for scale consistency across the various market participants and the way things are processed, the way information is managed, the way transactions are confirmed and things are reported, and so the short note of that is, internally we\u2019re going to continue to lever technology anywhere we can and that\u2019s been a big part of what we\u2019ve done. But we\u2019re also going to try and do that as much as we can working with other folks in the industry and our clients to make sure all being is efficient as we possibly can as we all work in the same rule set. Now, you didn\u2019t specifically ask about it, but obviously we\u2019re going to stay relentlessly focused on the balance sheet and how we deploy our capital. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Actually that kind of brings me to the next question. Earlier it was asked about looking at maybe businesses or areas to get out of a swap, but as we just think about your current business mix and the opportunity to adopt to the new capital rules, how much opportunity is there to refine the balance sheet and have those ratios increase more than you would think just based on say the net income less capital deployment? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I think when you look at our ratios now, but we think they\u2019re in quite a good place. We\u2019ll see what happens with the, when the final rules are done. I guess, I would say, we start again with the client businesses and given the strength of all of our businesses at this stage, equities, fixed income, investment banking, asset management, our investing and lending business. We look at the strength of those business leads and our competitive position, it really feels at this stage it\u2019s very, very tactical and it\u2019s about fine point execution. Now of course that could all change and again we\u2019ll stay nimble, but that\u2019s where we would stand today. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And I guess, just to push on that like, it was just a year and half ago that the supplemental leverage ratio was even proposed, so I would assume it\u2019s hard to be completely efficient in adopting that throughout the businesses. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, sorry. I think you\u2019ll continue to see improvement in things like that. That\u2019s not what I was saying. What I was saying is, its going to be tactical and we\u2019ll continue to work at it because you\u2019re right, we\u2019re new and we\u2019re just living with it. But I don\u2019t see it at this stage given the adjustments the business we\u2019ve sold, the things we\u2019ve done, the balance sheet. I don\u2019t see us making bigger decision in terms around our business commitment and our commitment to our clients. That\u2019s what I meant. So you\u2019re not going to see the sales and other reinsurance business soon. Matt O'Connor: Okay. But just the, adopting these -- on the day sale question is, how much optimizing is there out there further due maintaining your current strategy and the strengths that you have? Harvey Schwartz : We can always do more and you\u2019ll see us do more. But I\u2019m not in a position to quantify for you today. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on VaR. I was intrigued by the straightforward which came down queue-on-queue and obviously we had the flash crash in October. So does this represent maybe a VaR that went up early in the quarter? And then as folks move to the sidelines that came back down or am I thinking about that wrong? Harvey Schwartz : So, if you look at the in the VaR quarter-over-quarter it went from 66% down to 63% and you see the rate category move down current changes are but it sort of followed more the flows and levels of activity. In some businesses it was the result of position changes, but I don\u2019t think there is any major takeaways market volatility was a bigger driver and position changes was really a net reduction. Betsy Graseck : [Indiscernible] volatility, you had essentially bad volatility in rates, so I suppose that\u2019s why it came down a bit, but should we expect that is, if you get some slightly higher volatility or I would expect it would move higher. Is that accurate or no? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so I think maybe the best way to answer this question is to think about it in terms of average volatility across the quarter, and so the way we look at it because as we\u2019ve discussed before from a risk perspective VaR is an important risk measure, but obviously it can be influenced by market volatilities. So, if you actually, if you look at the change in terms of how it moved the market volatility was an increase it was more or less offset by position reductions during the course of the quarter and that\u2019s what drove the change. In rate specifically volatility was up and our positions were down. And that probably gives you a really good roadmap in terms of how the risk moved during the quarter. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Got it. Okay. And then separately just could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about the asset management business and opportunities to expand that inorganically if there is any sense of \u2026? Harvey Schwartz : So you\u2019ve seen us do small bolt-on acquisitions over time. We\u2019re constantly looking at things. Obviously asset management has been a very important driver of growth over the last several years and this is, we\u2019re really -- I think in the early stages of where you\u2019re seeing a strategic initiative to grow asset management, the team has done a great job and I highlighted the three and the five year returns. So, we\u2019re open to really looking at anything, and so it\u2019s really all -- we\u2019ll all be driven by whether or not we think we can improve our performance and deliver better results for our clients. So, I would say we\u2019re very open-minded. But again, these things have to be accretive and we look through them at a very careful lens. Betsy Graseck : And distribution, is that something that you could potentially add to? Harvey Schwartz : We feel quite good about the -- we really do feel like we have a significantly differentiated private wealth franchise and our institutional team is great and we get a lot of value out of our third party distributors and so, again Betsy, look we\u2019re the leading M&A firm in the world. So I think it was good idea walking the door and one of our bankers had it, we\u2019d be the first firm to talk about it. It will be a little inconsistent with our whole philosophy not to talk about it, but it\u2019s not a priority right now for us. It\u2019s really about performance and delivering for the clients. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffery Harte : Good morning, Harvey. A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve seen the volatility kind of spike on and off for a number of months now. Do you have a sense for how this is impacting kind of client risk appetites and their willingness to transact? And I\u2019m kind of thinking corporate investment and investing clients in investment banking as I suppose it is while in trading. Harvey Schwartz : So, look I think, when you think about investment banking clients and CEOs and Boards and CFOs in terms of how they\u2019re making long-term strategic decisions, that\u2019s really -- that will be influenced by day-to-day volatility and obviously every informational fact is digested. But those long-term strategic decisions are really based more on long-term competitive drive and global growth and that kind of stability. And so, it\u2019s a factor, but as I said when we went to the call we comment with our backlog at the highest point it\u2019s been since 2007 and that should give you some indications of what we think the momentum is in the advisory business. It could always change but that\u2019s where the momentum stands today. In terms of the investing clients and those involved in the capital markets more directly, it\u2019s an interesting question. In periods where there is less friction and ease of volatility -- ease of liquidity, liquidity begets activity, and maybe the language we should we be using is less about volatility and more about volatility and liquidity. Volatility when absence of liquidity is maybe that on friendly version that people are looking to try and find language to describe, and when you have volatility but you have liquidity you can then react and you can execute on the new information you receive. So I\u2019m not sure I got to your questions, but I tried. Jeffery Harte : Okay. You talked kind of on the M&A, so I mean is it similar for some of the underwriting businesses that it means you\u2019re not seeing the volatility kind of cause corporate clients to maybe pull back on plans there? Harvey Schwartz : So, I don\u2019t know if I necessarily say its pointing back on plans in terms of the -- its really more whether the market is more receptive or not. If you really just wanted to contrast underwriting activity in the fourth quarter of 2013 with the fourth quarter of 2014, you just saw capital markets that kind of thundered through the end of the year last year, and this year the capital market just had a lot more to digest. I would say that was more driven by the investing side, basically saying, hey look lets take a pause and lets reassess versus issuers desire to issue at low yield and obviously there was spread pressure on a high yield as people digested the low energy prices, but we\u2019ll see how the year goes. I mean I think at these rate levels and these equity market levels their activity levels could be robust during the course of the year, but again we\u2019ll have to see what the market delivers. Jeffery Harte : Okay. And expenses have been here in a couple of times, but I think kind of maybe more directly my question would be, have we hit a point where we need to see revenue growth to see further profit margin expansion? Harvey Schwartz : Well, it will depend on what happens in the environment. I mean, again we\u2019re going to stay very focused on both lines. And so again, I guess, I could add to that question, and the risk is sounding a little bit cute, and we would have actually grown it and revenues have been flat, and it haven\u2019t really been flat because we\u2019ve been growing other businesses. So, we\u2019ve displayed the ability to do it for the last couple of years. Look, we\u2019re going to be very, very thoughtful as we have been about the balance of investing in the businesses where we see long-term growth. But again that won't -- we\u2019re not going to stop our relentless focus on efficiency. Jeffery Harte : Okay. And finally we\u2019re starting to hear again some talk of some competitors at least exiting some of the trading businesses and do you see that as a kind of competitive opportunity, I mean does it help you to maybe expand wallet share, improved pricing or is it just some of the businesses aren\u2019t as profitable and we hope eye is going to shrink. Are you seeing some of that? Harvey Schwartz : So we\u2019re certainly seeing in various businesses we feel it at least. Again we don\u2019t have full transparency, but in our dialogue with our clients we felt that in commodities this year. We\u2019ve seen it in other parts of the business. I guess, what I would say is in an environment like this, in terms of the competitive dynamic, I think if you want to be in these businesses through the whole cycle, I think some of the takeaway\u2019s are you have to have scale. It\u2019s very hard just to be in cash equities or to be in a very small component of the foreign exchange market. And you have to be able to leverage that scale really across the full franchise. It\u2019s not really just about the equity business, the prime brokerage business or the commodity business. You need technology scale to really be effective through the whole cycle and then you need the diversity because as we\u2019ve seen some pistons will fire sometime and sometimes they won't at other points as we go through this. And so, I know that\u2019s why we feel good about our competitive position because we know our clients still want to trade bonds, and we know they still want to hedge FX and we know they still want to manage their commodity risk. As we work through this part of the cycle it\u2019s just about us being well positioned and having that scale, and we feel like we have it. Jeffery Harte : Okay. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Just to follow-up on the VaR question but to ask it in terms of the change for the full year. Can you give us a sense just as you walk through the different asset classes of how much of the change over the course of the year was position reduction versus volatility change? Harvey Schwartz : So you\u2019re saying last year versus this year? Guy Moszkowski : Yes. So for example, if we look at rates, over the course of the year it fell from 62% to 41%. And I\u2019m just curious how much of that change was reduction in positions versus change in volatility sort of what are the components? Harvey Schwartz : Hey, I apologize. Dane can get it to you. I don\u2019t have the line-by-line in my head in terms of that. But I can tell you on the year-over-year in aggregate, but I\u2019d say what I mean line-by-line I don\u2019t have the specific categories in my head. But year-over-year the -- basically position changes were a reduction that was about three times the increase in terms of the volatility levels. So its real risk reduction. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was trying to get to and maybe I\u2019ll follow up on the others, but that\u2019s real helpful. On the -- just a housekeeping question, on the core Tier 1, the 12.2% is advanced approach is transitional right. Can you update us on the fully phased? Harvey Schwartz : Sure. So, it\u2019s 11.1% under the fully phased. You want me to give you the standardized that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. Guy Moszkowski : Yes, exactly. Harvey Schwartz : Okay, fine. Okay, so 11.3% as I said under the transitional for standardized and then 10.2% under fully phased. Now just a reminder on this, fully phased for us is really a conservative expectation, all other factors being equal in other words, we just stood here today with exactly the same balance sheet and nothing changed except for the retirement of funds as we comply with Volcker doing other things. You should probably add back to call it 40 basis points, 50 basis points to those fully funded number -- those fully phased numbers. Okay? Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That\u2019s also really helpful. And the question has kind of been asked a couple of times, but maybe I\u2019ll take a slightly different crack at it. In terms of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen, since the first of the year not just in terms of what happened yesterday in the currency market but more broadly with rates, long rates. I know we\u2019re only couple of weeks into the year, but do you expect a significant rethink in terms of the amount of risk that you and peers will be putting on the desks between now and the end of the quarter, the middle of the year? Harvey Schwartz : So, it\u2019s a great question because it allows me just to underscore a very important point. We scale our risk deployment to our client demand not the other way, and so it will really depend on what happens in terms of clients and their perceptions in the marketplace. And again I think it goes back to -- if you compare the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If we see more Septembers, than I think you will see increasing amount of client activity and opportunities for us to provide liquidity to our clients and deploy capital. I think if you see more Octobers and more Decembers, I think you might see less. Again, that\u2019s why we run these businesses for the long-term. I think importantly, one of the takeaways around these businesses is that there are times when things do change structurally. One of the structural changes its been on a decade plus shift to electronics rating and the need for technology. The people still wake up every morning and they want to trade bonds and they want to hedge foreign exchange. Nothing about that is changed. Its just where we\u2019re in the cycle. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. One final question and this isn\u2019t something that you frequently disclose, but there was a disclosure a number of years ago, that sort of in the period between 2006 and 2009, about half of your FICC revenues had been in some derivatives and now that we\u2019ve been through a significant period of regulatory change in terms of derivatives and cost of carry and everything. I was wondering if you could comment for 2014 roughly what percentage of thick revenues would have come from derivative transactions. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, I don\u2019t have that data handy, but we can dig into it. And if its meaningful we can certainly share it with folks. Guy Moszkowski : I mean, I guess, the only follow up would be -- I get that, but is it meaningfully less than it used to be? Harvey Schwartz : Well the one thing I would say that, and maybe these are good things, but host the crises, lots of things they build up in 2006 and 2007 like clients trading correlation and other things which during the crises proved to be less liquid than other things, that certainly looked like businesses that maybe gone forever. You always has been set up but it feels that way for now and maybe they should be. So, there\u2019s certainly elements in the derivative market that appears structurally changed since the crises. But we don\u2019t track that specifically from an auditor perspective, so I don\u2019t have that data. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Well, thanks for the color though. I appreciate it. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Fiona. Fiona Swaffield : Hi. Harvey Schwartz : Hi. Fiona Swaffield : Sorry, can you hear me? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, no worry. Fiona Swaffield : Sorry, some problems with the phone. Can you talk a bit about, I think you said this in the fourth quarter the de-risking helped the RWAs. But I mean, historically you\u2019ve talked about mitigation going forward. So can you talk about your plans kind of Basel III RWAs, and also I know its early days but there\u2019s some new proposals after Basel before Christmas. Do you have any kind of thoughts on those or how they would, could affect you the U.S. bank? Harvey Schwartz : So, on the new proposals obviously we\u2019ll do what we\u2019ve done in the past. We want to be an active and constructive participant in the dialogue with the regulators, but its pretty early days on lots of those discussions. But again, we\u2019ll just participate in that dialogue and you\u2019ll see our comments and things like that. In terms of, I think there\u2019s an important thing to highlight here; there were no businesses here that we\u2019re looking to shutdown in terms of driving improving capital ratios. We feel quite good with the significant progress our teams have made over the last couple of years. Now having said that again this is something that I just think that there is standard operating procedure for any regulated financial institution in terms of having technology, tool, education and a process towards making sure you deploy your capital in a way that\u2019s most impactful for your clients and provide your shareholders with the best return. And so, I think that\u2019s just standard operating procedure for us. So you\u2019ll continue to see us mitigate, but at this stage we made a huge amount of progress, I mean, there\u2019s a whole lots of things I can highlight. I think the balance sheet reduction exercise in the second quarter was a real demonstration of response to nimbleness. Fiona Swaffield : Okay. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Just quickly maybe if you can talk about some of the other, the more liquidity ratios. Do you have any kind of update on where you guys stand on the LCR and NSFR, have you kind of done any kind of backed envelop stuff with respect to those? Harvey Schwartz : So, in relationship to the LCR which is, we\u2019re in excess of the requirement. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : In terms of the NSFR that\u2019s an interesting one because, obviously if you take a step back in NSFR, obviously any rule that\u2019s supportive of good proper industry wide asset liability management, we\u2019re supportive of, it will be very interesting to see how the rule evolves in discussions with the local regulators because as you know in the proposed rule they came out. There really are, there\u2019s some interesting things in there, one being obviously this notion of how transactions get linked. So we\u2019ll have to see what the final determination on that is when we get that from all the regulators, and also obviously the treatment of deposits where different geographies have different legal and regulatory regimes, and in the U.S. obviously we have a restrictive regime in terms of how deposits can be utilized. So, I\u2019d say on the NSFR it\u2019s a bit of a wait and see. Jim Mitchell : Okay. I would imagine with you guys given your structure that the TLAC is probably not a problem. Is that a fair statement or? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, again where we stand today, again at preliminary rule. Right, so I caveat that with all the facts that we\u2019ll have to see where it goes, but that would be our takeaway and our early read. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And then maybe just broadly on the pipeline record levels, it sounds like one area advisory is clearly strong. Can you comment on the other areas where you\u2019re seeing, is it -- is debt still holding in there given the financing needs for the M&A environment or how is equities doing? How do we think about the pipeline in the different components? Harvey Schwartz : So, as I said the advisory side of the line was really the biggest driver that\u2019s probably not a surprise for you given all the announced transaction to the marketplace. If you sort of look at it year-over-year, equity was down, debt was up a little bit. But it does feel like at least if the marketplace and asset prices can stay here, it feels like a reasonable environment to me for the coming year. But again these things can change on a dime. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes, good morning. Every quarter we go through this and looking at the capital markets business and rates and credit Zigs [ph] and currencies and equity Zags [ph] and you talked about the environment on October versus November and so on. But when I look at the -- kind of the industry revenue totals on an annual basis, they\u2019re incredibly stable and my peer group is probably the same as yours, but its been somewhere between $110 billion and $120 billion of revenues on an annual basis ever since 2011 and we\u2019re probably like 7% or 8% below 11% now. And it just seems to me like the explanation must be that the buy side is becoming increasingly concentrated, larger entities, more resource, and just like you\u2019re able to measure client profitability, they\u2019re able to measure what they pay all the brokers and isn\u2019t the issue more that there is kind of a fixed wallet that the buy side has on an annual basis and that there is not going to be an environment in the future where they pay a whole lot more than they are now? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I guess the -- we should probably have a long philosophical conversation; it probably requires having a glass of wine or beer or something. But I think that the -- I think that you have to really look at these businesses over very, very long periods of time. And so for example when there was growth, lets just say from the period of like 2002 to 2007, I don\u2019t think clients were looking to pay more, I think they were always very, very obsessed around transaction costs. As a matter of fact, the vast reduction in transaction cost for example the equity business actually occurred during that period of growth. And so, we assume that our clients as fiduciaries are always going to focus on transaction cost. I think that less the issue, I think its much more environment driven. We\u2019ve been in a period of near zero global interest rates for an extended period of time, post the financial crises, and so I think our clients are in some respects as a result struggling for their own after production in some cases which translates again into reduced activity, but our clients have always been focused on minimizing transaction cost as they should be [indiscernible] philosophical conversation. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Fair enough. I mean, if I was right, would you manage your business differently than you are? Harvey Schwartz : Its hard for me to imagine any of our businesses and say, look they\u2019re going to stay exactly the same for the next 10 years. So slightly that will be a nice way to live, but our businesses are just more dynamic than that. We think its part of the competitive advantage of Goldman Sachs just responding to the changes. So, I think its going to be dynamic. Chris Kotowski : All right. Fair enough. Harvey Schwartz : It is very difficult sitting here today to predict, like it was a couple of years ago, no one would have predicted the way the M&A that we\u2019re experiencing. But not of course it feels very natural, and now people feel like it will extend. I do think this is a case of all of us, this is a natural inclination to extend the most recent set of data that we have. Now, it was going to stay like this for the next 10 years, can you promise me that? Yes, there maybe, we would even push harder of efficiencies. But again we\u2019re positioning for operating leverage and growth. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : So, first a quick one on Banco Esp\u00edrito Santo, lots of increase given what happened this quarter and your involvement in the initial deal. Did that have any impact on the results this quarter at all? Harvey Schwartz : So, in terms of [indiscernible] my result this quarter its immaterial. For us, -- and I guess, I would add in terms of the -- on the fixed side of the business not the primary driver. But for us obviously as you have seen in our public commentary we\u2019re very surprised by the Bank of Portugal\u2019s unexpected and very surprising reversal of its prior written decision on this matter. And so, for us really this is really, it\u2019s the matter of our client, it is not about Goldman Sachs, and so we have clients that relied on those representations and so, we remain in active dialogue with the Bank of Portugal and obviously it\u2019s a very fluid situation. Brennan Hawken : Okay. But is it fair to characterize it as maybe small but in your view immaterial impact? Harvey Schwartz : I would say not a primary driver of FICC, but obviously in FICC. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : It is obviously part of the revenue decline. Brennan Hawken : Got it. And then thinking about your physical business on the commodity side, you guys are one of the few left. We\u2019re seeing given some of the dynamics there in that market but improving -- and improving bed for storage, how are you seeing that play out in your physical business as we move forward from here? Harvey Schwartz : So, we always think of the -- that our focus in commodities is really and we used to think about is divide into two things, investments that we make in terms of things like metro which we sold during the course of the quarter. When we purchased metro, it was always purchased with the notion that we would add value to the enterprise and then ultimately sell metro. That was always part of the strategic design. In terms of our commodity franchise, which we\u2019re as you know very committed to. The focus there is on the hedging of commodity price exposures and working with all those clients globally whether they be corporates or investors. And so that\u2019s really how we think about the strategy. Obviously ownership of physical commodities is getting -- we think is actually a good review by the Federal Reserve. We are very focused on safety and soundness. We think its perfectly understandable that they\u2019re doing the same. But that\u2019s our strategy in commodities. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then last one also just on sort of oil. Thinking about the drop here in oil and your M&A franchise, energy has been a pretty meaningful part of the M&A market last few years. What sort of near-term and then maybe a bit longer term impact you anticipate the drop in oil would have to M&A activity from here? Harvey Schwartz : Well I think big picture, the drop in oil which really started in June but obviously it started getting a lot of attention in the fourth quarter. I think at the highest level a lot has been written about the tradeoffs between near-term impact on markets, but obviously a big tailwind in terms of expense reduction and a benefit for the consumer. And so, we talk to our economist net-net, as you\u2019ve seen from us, we think the price decline if it stays here is a tailwind for global economic growth. As it relates specifically to the industry, if we go through a period of sustained declined prices around this level, then clearly its going to put certain parts of the industry under stress. There will be opportunities to help those clients, work through those stresses. There will be opportunities to deploy new hedging strategies, there will be potentially merger opportunities as the organization works through what is really a case of excess supply. So again, its very early days and these things tend to play out over months and years when you get these kind of price declines. But clearly clients will be looking for advice from Goldman Sachs. Brennan Hawken : Okay, but no specific commentary as far as the M&A outlook is concerned and the impact there? Harvey Schwartz : No, I think it\u2019s a bit early. And I think it will be very specific to certain situations in terms of how we work through the cycle. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color, Harvey Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, Harvey. Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi. How are you? Steven Chubak : Doing well. Thanks. So, I just had one follow-up question on the capital discussion. Maybe looking at it from a different angle, the presentation you guys had given a couple of months ago is extraordinarily informative. Certainly help us think about all the different constraints that you\u2019re managing to. But from your perspective given that your business adjustments that you plan on making are merely going to be tactical at this juncture, and given our understanding of the constraints and the final rules and where they sit today, what do you believe your spot or required capital levels are at the moment to support your business? Harvey Schwartz : gone [ph] 15th (0:18): Steven Chubak : It does. But presumably given what we know today whether its about CCAR being binding or the Feds latest proposal recognizing that there could be additional changes going forward that 8.5% plus whatever buffer you didn\u2019t appropriate is probably not where your required capital or target is ultimately going to shake out. Presumably it will be higher than that, and not just for you but for industry peers as well. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, I would agree with that. You didn\u2019t ask the question but again this is a very early read of the proposal that\u2019s out, and so subject to change. So caveat it accordingly. But our early read and interpretation of the documents out there that it would add 1% for us. And so what you said earlier I think is the more important thing which is in terms of a binding constraints, the binding constraint for us is CCAR. And so, we\u2019ll continue to focus very much on all aspects of the capital ratios. But for us the binding constraint has proven to be CCAR. Steven Chubak : Okay. Maybe just one quick follow-up. Is it CCAR risk based or leverage based ratios. It felt as though in the last exam it was leveraged. I didn\u2019t know if you felt that, that would potentially evolve as CCAR changes over the next couple of years. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so -- look I think the Federal Reserve has said CCAR was going to be dynamic and so we\u2019ll see how they made changes and their test has proven to be dynamic. We can only tell you it was constraining last year as you saw publicly because of the leverage test and then you saw subsequently take certain actions and that obviously influenced our activity around the balance sheet and how we had to think about re-pricing that capital. Steven Chubak : All right. Harvey that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Good to hear from you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matthew Burnell : Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick administrative follow-ups. Just following up on the prior discussion, have you provided or given any thought just sort of the short-term wholesale funding buffer and how that might effect your future ratios and if there is any meaningful consideration being given within that calculation for the maturity even within the short-term bucket? Harvey Schwartz : So, as I said before just so we\u2019re clear to everybody, so our preliminary expectation and again I caveat that because this rule is very fluid and its in formation only would add an incremental 100 basis points to our G-SIB buffer. Matthew Burnell : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : In terms of how we\u2019re going -- again I think its really most important for takeaway for everyone to understand the framework for how we think about managing the capital against multiple constraints. So, any time in a new regulatory regime any time we\u2019re deploying our balance sheets you have to be able to think through multiple lenses and view things through multiple lenses, that\u2019s why we created the framework that we discussed at the conference in November which basically ascribes a waiting system to that and that gives us a consistent lens to look at things like the use of balance sheet and the supplementary leverage ratio, stresses from CCAR, Basel III standardized, Basel III advanced. And you have to look at all those things individually at the same time. So, capital management, but the regulators have done an immense amount of work to increase capital levels and make the system safer and as a market participant we need to develop technologies and our philosophy and approach to basically work within that framework and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Matthew Burnell : That\u2019s helpful. And then a question in terms of operating or operational RWA, a number of your peers mentioned that they had increased operating or operational RWA this quarter. Was that true for Goldman as well? Harvey Schwartz : No, during the course of the quarter -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter they were basically essentially flat down a little bit. Matthew Burnell : Okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Devin Ryan : Hi. Good morning, Harvey. Devin Ryan : Just a couple of quick follow-ups from me as well here, so just on the investment banking backlog comments I\u2019m glad to hear that the backlog is where it is. But debt underwriting specifically can you speak to maybe some of the puts and takes of the high bar in recent years and corporate issuance that, that maybe tough to match versus the opportunity that you\u2019re speaking about with M&A related financings and how much of an offset that could represent? Harvey Schwartz : So of all the things that I\u2019ve been I think really that I\u2019m predicting over the last couple of years, its been the annual question about what we think debt underwriting is going to do in the next year. I think you could easily take a position over the last two years that maybe debt underwriting will be lower than the previous year. But the markets have remained robust. M&A activity can be a significant driver of financing activity. I think if rates stay low and the markets are stable and spreads are tight, I think you could see a very reasonable environment. I think if you see the contrary then obviously it will have an impact on activity, and very difficult to predict from here. I mean rates are very low. So for many issuance its going to look quite attractive over the course of the year. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just on comp, some of your peers are talking about changing their methodology around different comp, and I know you don\u2019t specifically disclose level of differed comp, but in a roughly flat year for reported comp, is it reasonable to assume that differed comp is also roughly flat or is there any additional qualitative detail you can provide around how you guys are thinking about the mix there? Harvey Schwartz : So, I think the better way to think about that is, we\u2019ve been consistent in our compensation philosophy for a number of years in terms of really ensuring that our employees and it goes up as you go up through the seniority of the firm through to the partners that you hold a significant amount of equity and there\u2019s been no change of philosophy over the last several years. Devin Ryan : That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Douglas Sipkin : Yes, thank you. Good morning. Two questions, first on fake and I\u2019m just curious for your guys perspective and opinion Harvey. I mean, given the sort of change in liquidity that\u2019s come to these markets in the last, lets call it five or six years since the credit crises. I mean, is your guys position that credit is maybe a little bit more vulnerable to smaller shocks given the lack of liquidity, i.e. I guess energy feels like it was the catalyst really for credit to weaken, but its still only, I mean, its bigger but its only like 14%, 15% of high yield. So, is it more pronounced now credit events given the lack of liquidities at your guy\u2019s perspective or it was just kind of a tough quarter? Harvey Schwartz : It will be very difficult to anticipate whether or not this is kind of a new credit regime in terms of liquidity trading or it is -- these are sort of one off factors. Its always hard to assess that when you\u2019ve had multiple years of timing credit spreads, very low default rates. I will say when you look to the data I don\u2019t have it on top of my head particularly in Europe where liquidity was little challenged in the third quarter and then it got worse in the fourth quarter. I think because if market moves in terms of price movements they were pretty significant. More significant than you would have thought in terms of the underlying credit itself. And so clearly liquidity played a role in terms of the degree of price movement. But I wouldn\u2019t say at this stage you could draw any firm conclusions from that in terms of any long-term structural changes. Douglas Sipkin : Okay, great. And then shifting to asset management, obviously a great year for you guys. I was little surprised to see sort of the fixed income bucket on the flow side a little flattish for the fourth quarter and I was wondering, did you guys close some strategies or did something change just given how strong you guys have done obviously with performance and some of your competitors struggling throughout the year, and it still looked like fourth quarter industry wide that phenomena still played out. So I was just curious as to why you guys didn\u2019t sort of have the same flow dynamic you had throughout the first three quarters? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, I even had a chance to dig through sort of competitor results and maybe get more transparency over time than we do, but when we look at it over the course of the year which is really how we think about it. We took in $74 billion of long-term flows of which you highlighted $58 billion came in at fixed income. This could just be the timing of how various mandates that are rewarded arrive. We feel quite good about our performance and our ability to continue to gather assets on the back of that performance. Douglas Sipkin : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Yes, I just want to call out that you had mentioned that you had 754 million of litigation and regulatory expense in the period. Just want to make sure that, that\u2019s all related to investigations and not compliance costs in there. Harvey Schwartz : So that\u2019s all -all-- those are litigation related reserves that we access every quarter and we take a quarterly based on information we have on individual and specific cases. That\u2019s not a compensation build or an expense related to additional compliance people or something. I\u2019m not sure, I understood the question. So I\u2019m just trying to clarify it. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, that\u2019s the question. So I mean if those investigations go away is that kind of with the expense savings or be it was kind of more of a normalized level of litigation [ph]? Harvey Schwartz : As we work through legacy costs, ultimately that is the case. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And will you be able to put most of the major investigation behind you in 2015? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of litigation, you have seen us obviously make progress in the third quarter, we settled with the FHFA. I would encourage you to really dig through our disclosure where we give very vast disclosure around all facets of litigation and status. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Please check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, how are you? That\u2019s only like the fifth time I\u2019ve done that in this earning cycle. So you -- I just wanted to follow-up on the RWA discussion and see Harvey, if you could just help me kind of understand what the puts and takes of it might be over the course of this year? Harvey Schwartz : Are you saying on a going forward basis? Eric Wasserstrom : Correct. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, on a going forward basis, again I would say there is two things that underscore. The first is we\u2019re going to continue to be very focused on further rule compliance and being efficient about the capital. But a lot of it will be driven by client activity. Obviously, we are well positioned from a capital perspective. And so, we really want to stay front footed at as we to the extent to which clients demand are capital. And so we feel well positioned. Hard for me to tell you what those demands are going to be as we sit here in January, but we feel very well positioned, Eric Wasserstrom : And in terms of the very broad based reduction in assets that you undertook over the course of this year. Is that -- should we view that as being largely completed or is that something that is still under consideration for you over the course of this coming year. Harvey Schwartz : So immediately\\ we have no media plans to reduce the balance sheet from here, but again that's going to be subject to review continuously. And so again, it will be dynamic. If we feel like we are not getting the proper returns, then we will look to reduce. Its really just about discipline, at the same time making sure that we invest strategically for the long run. Eric Wasserstrom : Correct. And then, if I guess get a transition for a moment and in terms of the M&A pipeline, could you give us any sense of the complexion of it is that primarily in country as it more across board. Are we seeing any changes, I guess, the real question is are we singing any changes in terms of the complexion of M&A activity, relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the -- this past year? Harvey Schwartz : I mean, look in terms of year-over-year as you would expect the growth specifically in terms of the backlog, it really came work from Americas and Europe and it was really down in terms of Asia. That\u2019s how I describe a geographic measure, which is probably doesn\u2019t surprising. Eric Wasserstrom : And I mean what is the -- I guess I'm trying to understand is the strategic rational changing at all among corporate Boards and terms of growth orientation versus cost savings orientation or any kind of that kind of strategic level discussion. Harvey Schwartz : I think that its, when we talked to our M&A team, what they will tell you is very industry specific. It can be geographic, but the moment level is quite high and so I guess when you look back at it, I said earlier there were a number of folks who would say look we never see M&A again a couple of years ago and that was just where we want in a cycle, but I think that in a world which generally increasingly stable, low growth, but stable CEO\u2019s and boards will look to grow revenues and a strategic opportunity. The one thing that we\u2019ve seen as part of this past cycle, driven by strategics is large transactions tend to spin-off lots of activity in particular sectors. So I don\u2019t know when you talked to our M&A team. I don\u2019t know they would say, look this is all cost driven or this is all top line driven. It\u2019s a mix of factors that will drive action. The momentum feels quite good. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Richard Bove : Good morning. This is kind of a broad question. So I apologize, after a very long call, but over the past couple of days having getting questions on both sides of Goldman Sachs, if you will. While in terms of structure, one is given everything hat you\u2019ve mentioned about capital and constraints on the business placed by the regulators. Should in fact Goldman Sachs be broken up? And if not, why should it be kept together? The other side being asked, given the high level of cyclicality in the two main businesses of the company, should Goldman Sachs make a major acquisition either an asset management company, or a wealth management company, which we give the company a recurring stream of revenue to eliminate some of the [indiscernible] volatility and its revenues and earnings. I don\u2019t know is it the same question basically which is what should the structure, Goldman Sachs be over the next 4 to 5 years? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so it\u2019s a good question and obviously there has been a lot of focus on there. So, I guess, we first have to say -- so, if anything what\u2019s changed today because I think prior to the crisis there was a belief that obviously it benefits to scale and you can get scale and you can have synergies. I think the change that people are focused on now is obviously there is a cost, a capital cost that the regulators are putting on side and so its very natural that the question that you're asking. Now, for GS, I would highlight a couple of things. First of all, we\u2019re just significantly smaller than many of the other firms and our balance sheet at $850 plus billion. Many of our competitors are more than twice our size and we\u2019ve 34,000 employees and they may have hundreds of thousands of employees, and so we are smaller and we are less complex. And as a result, we're somewhat simpler. So what I would say is when we look at the collection of businesses that we have, the way we answer the synergy question is first and foremost through the eyes of the clients. Do we think we provide more value to our clients by having a collection of businesses together or not? It doesn't matter to us when in any given quarter the stock markets may be not valuing one of our businesses as perfectly as we would like it to be. It's really a question of over the long run can we drive shareholder value by having that benefit to our clients. So let's take fixed income and equity as one example. In an environment where its technology driven and the clients increasingly get larger, you need to scale across those businesses. We started running those businesses as a collective shortly after 2000 I think. And so the ability to deliver one technology platform across those businesses have one risk management system, all those things provide us with scale and we think we\u2019re able to execute better. It then feeds into our ability to adapt and develop technology tools around capital, and hopefully we are able to perform well in terms of deploying the firms\u2019 capital. When you think about investment banking, you bundle in. Think about the merger business today. And what we\u2019re able to do for our clients by having the ability to commit the capital and actually deliver to the capital markets and connect investors with issuers. Well, all of these things are very synergistic. Our private wealth business, with our banking business, with our asset management business, these are all things that we think we have synergies in. Now, in terms of smaller or bigger, I think it's going to be environment driven for us. You saw us, you have seen us shrink the balance sheet pretty dramatically thinking you have known us for long time, we used to run at 1.1, 1.2 trillion. We\u2019ve been around 900 and now well below that for quite a while and so you\u2019re going to see us be dynamic about this. If we thought, we could drive more value for our clients and get more scale then we would consider things. I will say now it\u2019s harder obviously because there is the explicit pricing end, if you want to call it tax of incremental capital. You have to be very confident that you can get those synergies in that scale. That answer okay, given the breadth of your question. Richard Bove : Yes, I think it makes a great deal of sense. What about the other foot side of the question, which is where can you come up with a recurring revenue stream that would lower the volatility in your current business mix. Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s funny. I can\u2019t help myself big. I know you say there a lot of volatility in our current revenue mix, but we have actually produced $34 billion in revenues for three years running. And we\u2019ve grown the ROE and we shrunk the balance sheet and we\u2019ve increased the pre-tax and we replaced $2.5 billion of revenues that didn\u2019t disappear because of volatility, it disappeared because we sold them. So I\u2019m not telling you its going to always be this stable, but touch wood it feels pretty stable last couple of years. Richard Bove : Okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Limb with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Andrew Limb : Hi. Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi. Good morning. Andrew Limb : I\u2019ve just got a -- good morning. I\u2019ve got a question on the trading book review that mostly the Basel committee is undertaking and whether you could give anymore color on what kind of impacts it might have on the industry on an absolute basis, and also how you stack up relative to your peers? Harvey Schwartz : So on the trading book review we think it\u2019s very important obviously and we\u2019re in active dialogue. There\u2019s been the QIS and -- so again its very early on that. So I don\u2019t have any specific comments on the trading book review. I think what I would say is that, and again I think you have to give credit and kudos to the regulators. They have been incredibly productive over the last several years. If we paused a list out for all the regulatory changes, its incredible in terms of the impact on capital, liquidity, trading, top execution facilities and so, one of the things I think we all need to consider is market participants, and when I say that I mean clients, folks like ourselves and regulators is we need to maybe at least think about pausing a bit and digesting the impact of these rules. There\u2019s no doubt that these rules make the system stronger and safer as I said before. I do think there\u2019s a benefit to absorbing how they interact over the long periods of time, because you can't get all those benefits without some cost. We can't necessarily always identify those costs immediately. And so that would be my very high level comment on that. But I don\u2019t have any specific comments on any proposed revisions for the rules. Andrew Limb : And is it something that you\u2019re running internally just to see what the impact is at the moment or is that too early to do that? Harvey Schwartz : So, we\u2019re very consistent on our philosophy and yes in terms of proposed rules. It follows a very normal course protocol for us. We work as constructively as we can with the regulators in terms of trying to provide them with data and dialogue on the impact of overrule. So we\u2019re always active participants and we dedicate a lot of time and people and system and math to the QIS as they come out whether with any rule and we always try and be an active participant in terms of giving good balanced feedback to the regulators in terms of the benefits and cause of any proposed rule, which is very early in this potential rewrite. It\u2019s just too early to comment on it. Andrew Limb : Okay. And then just carrying on to another regulation the NSFR. I know you said that was early as well, but any thoughts about how that might impinge on your prime brokerage business and in terms of like incumberment to your balance sheet assets? Harvey Schwartz : Now again too early to tell. We\u2019ll see how it ultimately evolves when we get a local regulation. As I said, a big part of the discussion will be around the treatment of deposits. But look, I think what you\u2019re going to see the world do as they adjust is all firms, not just Goldman Sachs. All firms will look for what we\u2019ll call net stable funding ratio funding, whatever that ends up being defined as. And so, we\u2019ll see how the rule evolves. But look, we\u2019ll adapt. You\u2019ve seen us do it whether it\u2019s the Basel III ratio, the supplementary leverage ratio, all these things. We\u2019ll just -- we still need to see a rule. Andrew Limb : Okay. And then just one final question. Is that target SLR that you\u2019re aiming for heading into the CCAR at all? Harvey Schwartz : No. At this stage not. As you saw into the SLR right at this stage, as you saw we\u2019re at 5%. That\u2019s up about 80 basis points in the course of the year, so now we\u2019re complying with 2018. One of the things is we\u2019ll continue to review this. There are whole lots of factors that could improve that ratio from here, but again we\u2019ll be assessing all of our buffers as we get the final capital rules. Again we all interact, right? So, you really want to get to a point of stability of rule making and then you can really set the parameters and dial them in more tightly. Andrew Limb : Great. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. I appreciate you dialing in. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : So, hey everyone. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all you for joining the call. Hopefully myself and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If there is any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to give Dane a call, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and a long weekend and look forward to speaking with you our first quarter earnings call coming up in April. Take care everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Dennis and I'll be your conference facilitator today. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the Firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain and outside of the Firm's control. The Firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, Global Core Liquid Assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our web site at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the Firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I will walk you through the first quarter results, and I am happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $10.6 billion; net earnings $2.8 billion; earnings per diluted share, were $5.94, and our annualized return on common equity was 14.7%. The first quarter was dominated by one primary theme, central bank policies. In the United States, the market heavily debated whether 2015 would be the year that the Federal Reserve raises rates. On the other hand, the European Central Bank announced the creation of a \u20ac1.1 trillion quantitative easing program that kicked off in March. The prospect of two of the world's largest economies, implementing divergent monetary policies had a significant impact. Market participants reassess the implications for both global economic growth, and as a consequence, the performance of various financial assets. Regarding the economic outlook, on one hand, low rates are viewed as providing an important economic stimulus to the United States. On the other hand, a return to normalized rates would be consistent with a strong underlying economy. Looking at the bigger picture, the degree of conviction around a slow but stable U.S. recovery continued to gain support for most of the quarter. The weaker recent jobs report in the U.S. has sparked some debate around the timing and magnitude of potential rate hikes. However, the long term expectation of slow, but steady growth and higher rates, remains intact. Across the Atlantic, the announcement of quantitative easing in Europe provided some stability and the basis for greater economic growth in the region. The launch of a \u20ac60 billion per month purchasing program provided greater confidence to market participants on the Eurozone outlook. The impact was immediately felt across European financial markets. If you take the European government bond market for example, more than a quarter of the bonds are trading with negative yields today. The equity markets in Europe rallied, as demonstrated by the 18% increase in the Euro Stoxx 50 Index during the quarter, and the Euro reached its lowest level versus the dollar in 12 years. As a result, there was greater activity as clients responded to heightened market volatility. Given the scope, complexity and significance of these two different monetary policies, it isn't surprising, that there continues to be a robust discussion around the potential impacts. For our firm, the focus continues to be our clients and serving their needs. Our clients are placing a greater premium on both intellectual and financial capital, given market dynamics and an evolving competitive landscape. We are committed to providing our clients with superior advice, investment performance, content, market liquidity, and certainty of execution. We believe that our extensive capabilities favorably position us to meet a variety of client needs, in what is certainly a dynamic market environment. Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter revenues of $1.9 billion, up 32% from the fourth quarter. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year, but its still up significantly, relative to a year ago. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $961 million, the highest since 2007. This 39% increase relative to the fourth quarter reflects both the increase in completed M&A, and the strength of our leading global franchise. In the quarter, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Allergan's $71 billion sale to Activis; RWE's \u20ac5.1 billion sale of RWE-DEA, [indiscernible] Group, and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company's $5.7 billion acquisition of Protective Life Corporation. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter; these include, MeadWestvaco's merger with Rock-Tenn for a combined enterprise value of $20 billion; Charter Communications' $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; and Dow Chemicals' $5 billion separation of its chlor-alkali and downstream businesses, to Olin Corporation. Moving to Underwriting, revenues were $944 million in the first quarter, up 26% sequentially as equity issuance improved. During the quarter, we ranked first in Global Equity and Equity Related and Common Stock offerings. Equity Underwriting revenues of $533 million rose 56% compared to the fourth quarter, largely due to an increase in secondary offerings. Debt underwriting revenues were essentially unchanged at $411 million. During the first quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, leading Santander's \u20ac7.5 billion follow-on equity offering; Chevron's AUD4.7 billion sale of its stake in Caltex Australia; and Berkshire Hathaway's \u20ac3 billion investment grade issuance. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $5.5 billion in the first quarter, up significantly compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, and included $32 million of DVA losses. Net revenues were up more than 2.5 times sequentially, as client activity increased in a number of our businesses, in response to higher volatility and improved market conditions. Interest rates and currencies were both significantly higher sequentially, as client activity improved amid diverging central bank policies. Credit increased significantly from a more challenging fourth quarter, as credit spreads generally tighten during the first quarter. Mortgages also rose versus the fourth quarter, although volatility and client activity remained generally low. Given continued trends in the energy markets, commodities improved sequentially, with higher levels of client activity. In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 20% sequentially and include $12 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution net revenues increased 50% sequentially to $1.1 billion due to a favorable market-making backdrop with higher levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives. Commissions and fees were $808 million, down 3% relative to the fourth quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $393 million, up 12% sequentially, reflecting higher customer balances. Turning to Risk; average daily VaR in the first quarter was $81 million, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. The move up was primarily due to increased market volatility across all categories. Moving on to our investing and lending activates; collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the first quarter. Following a sale of our investment in Metro International in the fourth quarter, we made a decision that the remaining revenue related to consolidated investments within the other line, was not significant in the context of the I&L segment. As a result, we are now reporting the other I&L revenues within the equity and debt lines. Equity Securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $509 million, with roughly $200 million in net interest income and the balance coming from net gains. In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision remain flat at $1.18 trillion. $7 billion of long term net inflows, driven by fixed income and equity products, and net market appreciation of $6 billion were offset by net outflows of $14 billion in liquidity products. Moving to performance; across the global platform, 82% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year basis, and 73% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five year basis. Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense, which include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history, and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2014. Our lower accrual rate reflects our strong 14% year-over-year net revenue growth and the positive operating leverage embedded in our firm. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the fourth quarter, and slightly lower than the first quarter of 2014. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and higher impairment charges on consolidated investment entities. Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter; total staff was approximately 34,400, up 1% from year end 2014. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.7%, that is down from a 2014 rate, primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix. Our global core liquid assets ended $175 billion. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 11.4% using the standardized approach, it was 12.6% under the advanced approach. Starting this quarter, the lower of these two ratios is our binding regulatory constraints. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.3%, 30 basis points above the minimum requirement that begins in 2018. And finally, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock for $1.25 billion in the first quarter. These repurchases reflected the completion of our 2014 capital plan. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our revised 2015 capital plan, which includes share repurchases, dividends and other capital actions. In terms of this year's CCAR test, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share beginning in the second quarter. As it relates to our share repurchase capacity, one point I want to highlight, is that any potential share repurchases over the next five quarters, will be heavily back-end weighted. As you all know, we do not publicly disclose the approved size of our repurchase capacity. Again, we take this approach for a very specific and practical reason. We don't want our shareholders to view the approved buyback amount as a commitment to return that capital. For us, capital allocation is a dynamic process. If we see opportunities to deploy the capital attractively to support client activity, we want the flexibility to do it, and conversely, if our clients are less active, we will certainly look to return it. our track record on this one, is well established. Now, before I take your questions, let me offer some closing thoughts. The first quarter has served as a strong start to 2015. The year-over-year increase in net revenues reflects, not only the strength of our franchise, but also our ability to provide high quality advice and certainty of execution for our clients. Our performance this quarter, well just a quarter, reflects numerous efforts over the last several years to adjust our business. We sold several businesses due to regulatory capital implications. We transformed our financial profile, significantly improving our risk based capital. We revamped our capital allocation processes, improving our decision-making and efficiency. We took a hard look at our operating cost, fundamentally changing our expense structure by eliminating costs, reallocating resources, and leveraging technology. We made all these changes, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our global client franchise. We know that our success in many ways begins and ends with our clients. It\u2019s the trust they place in us and our ability to execute on their behalf that drives our franchise, and we believe that our steady commitment, particularly through these more difficult years, has been critical to creating stronger client relationships. And there is one important thing that we didn't change, our focus on creating shareholder value, our efforts are ultimately a reflection of our commitment to you, our owners. We understand that to create shareholder value, we need to have strong financial footings, be an efficient allocator of capital, and have a world class client franchise. Ultimately, our efforts over the past several years have meant that a 14% increase in year-over-year revenues can contribute to a 40% increase in net earnings, a 48% increase in earnings per share, a 380 basis point improvement in ROE, and finally 9% growth in book value per share over the past year. Thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Hey good morning Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Let's start with Investing and Lending, it was pretty darn good. I am curious on the equity side, how much of it was actually realized in asset sales, because it was a pretty active quarter? And then maybe related to that, if you could give the portfolio of breakdown in terms of equity, debt and lending assets? Harvey Schwartz : So, let's just start with the balance sheet; you know that the balance sheet at the end of the quarter for the fourth quarter was $79.5 billion and in terms of debt, that's basically -- north of $50 billion of that is in the debt line. So that's the bulk of the balance sheet. In terms of equity, as you know, we have $4 billion of public equity and $18 billion of private equity. Now, in terms of the performance in the equity line, in terms of the quarter, we don't think of it as much as asset sales, because we make asset sales often, there is a period we are restricted. That's why we are careful to give you the public equity numbers. But basically, when you break it down, give or take 40% of the performance came from those assets that are already public. 40% came from basically company improvements and the balance would come from things like pending IPOs and things like that. That's how I'd break it down for you. Glenn Schorr : And, what's the disallowed portion or what's the best way to ask how much Goldman still has in the funds that you need to eventually liquidate? Harvey Schwartz : So I think -- I just want to make sure, I am going to rephrase your question to make sure I understand it. I think you're saying that, in terms of -- under regulatory guidelines, under the vocal compliance, that number is approximately $8 billion, and so, a bit of a high class problem, as we have been harvesting, that number has obviously been going up, because there has been good performance. Now remember of course, one of the reasons we were focusing on that with you over the last couple of years is, because the original deadline in that was July of this year. Of course, the regulators have granted an industry-wide extension on that through 2017. So we continue to focus on it. Glenn Schorr : Great. Last one is, on FICC, I mean, the macro products are great, but credit mortgage wasn't, so not exactly hitting on all cylinders as a whole. But it certainly seems like, maybe some of the reduced capacity in the industry is helping you, and so your long term strategy that we all beat you up for the last five years might be working. Could you talk towards what you're seeing in terms of capacity and now that you've seen a pickup involved, clearly [ph], what it means? Harvey Schwartz : So on FICC, I think you're right to say that, one of the things we have benefited from, certainly is the diversity of the businesses. Its not just FICC, its across equities as well, because as you said, even in a quarter like this, where you're seeing improved FICC performance sequentially and year-over-year, you're really seeing it in the macro side of the business, and as you said, not all cylinders are firing. In terms of us, through this part of the cycle, while you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very-very committed to the businesses, and we are seeing it translate through. I don't have perfect visibility into our competitor's obviously, but you've seen the announcements, some things more stark like commodities. But certainly, we are hearing it from clients, and now we are starting to see a bit of it, I would say geographically, certainly in Europe. I know you asked about FICC, maybe take the equity business for example. We have seen a trend in derivatives, and then certainly in a quarter like this, it was pretty significant. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning Christian. Christian Bolu : So to start on maybe CCAR, the Firm has proven very adaptable in managing the regulatory environment. As you think about, obviously, your CCAR results. I am just curious as to what levers you have here to improve your relative positioning? Harvey Schwartz : Sorry, I didn't hear the very beginning of your question, I apologize Christian. Could you just repeat it? Christian Bolu : Yeah. So my question basically is just on your CCAR ratios. I am just curious, what levers you have to improve your positioning? Harvey Schwartz : Right. Okay, I understand. So as you know, we get very little transparency by design, in terms of how the regulators have constructed CCAR going into the test. One thing of course is, we get transparency on our results coming out of the test. And so last year, you saw us digest that information among other regulatory constraints, and we took very immediate action around the balance sheet, and as you saw in the second quarter, reduced the balance sheet by $50 billion. Every year's test, you learn a little bit more in terms of the results. This year's tests, in terms of the constraints, again this is all public, had to deal with total capital, and so we are again digesting the results, and we will look at that, in terms of how we think about deploying our balance sheet, our capacity and our capital structure, and again, we will go through a process. I am not saying the process will yield the same results in terms of last year's balance sheet actions, but we are going through that same diagnostic process now, with our teams in the businesses. Christian Bolu : Okay. Have you mentioned your clients are placing a greater premium on kind of financial capital, and [indiscernible] execution. Curious to how this is being expressed? Are you seeing a wider bid-ask spreads in the market that give you more business, or something else? Harvey Schwartz : So, as I mentioned, we are seeing it in certain parts. I guess one of the areas I point to, is if you just look at the capital we committed to block transactions during the course of the quarter, obviously there were some significant capital commitments we made to clients during the course of the quarter, the largest block transactions that were done. And so, we felt very well positioned to connect those sellers or issuers of equity, with buyers on the other side. I'd say more broadly, the process of repricing has been maybe slower than folks would have expected. We are certainly seeing it in parts of the business, and when you start to see it, is when the market picks up. So again, I highlight the derivatives activity, which was a solid driver in our equities client execution line this quarter. We have also talked about it in commodities for example. So in the comm markets, you don't see it as much. But when activity picks up, you start to see it. Christian Bolu : Great, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Any more color you can give us in terms of the strengths within equity, derivatives, from a regional point of view, should we assume that it was in Europe, from QE and some of the movement in prices there. Just trying to piece that line item together a little bit more? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah so, within equities, the performance was really broad based in what we saw this quarter. We talked for a long time with you about -- to really be a significant player in this, you need to have scale and you need to -- for example, be in all the business lines, whether its prime brokerage, derivatives, ability to commit capital which I just spoke about, you need to have strong electronic capabilities, and you need to be geographically diverse. And this was a quarter, where we really saw strong contribution across the entire business, and I highlight derivatives in Europe, because it was a driver, and we hadn't seen it recently, but that's really a sum of it, but was really broad-based, and it really leaned into the strength of our business. And again also of course, we had a weaker Q1 last year. But it was a solid performance. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, in terms of the comp-to-revenue ratio coming down, I mean I feel like symbolically its important that the ratio came down the first quarter, which hasn't for several years. So just how are you thinking about, what the target is, in terms of operating leverage? You said, a focus on generating positive operating leverage, but I think it was more than two times to one, so you had a lot of margin there to say, play with? Harvey Schwartz : So, the 42% at this stage is our best estimate. We did reduce the competition expense last year from 44% to 43%, and then this is 42%. And again, we have always talked about the fact that, the compensation is going to be driven by performance, and this year with the 14% year-over-year increase in revenues, that's our best estimate. Now in terms of the operating leverage, this has been years of hard work, in terms of managing expenses, really thinking about how to most efficiently use the resources. And so, when you have that in place and you get the revenue uptick, obviously, its much -- you can more easily translate that into the bottom line, and that's what you're seeing this quarter. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning Harvey. Just a follow-up on the equity [indiscernible]. So it sounds like you mentioned the derivatives, you mentioned blocks; I just wanted to make sure on the block side, was there anything that was way outside, when you look at whether its maybe quarter-over-quarter, because year-over-year, you know, you had a weak comp? Harvey Schwartz : No. As I said, prime brokerage balances were up. There were a number of drivers in volume and activity. But it was really client driven. So there were index rebalance, transactions that we do. This quarter, we were able to facilitate large volumes for clients. It just came together nicely. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then -- I think it was the last quarter, but you guys gave some of the repositioning that has taken place in the past couple of years, the revenues that were lost. Then you guys have also mentioned, a lot of the investment that you are making on the technology side, to position for a lot of these new roles. When you think about, what is expected of the industry, at this point going forward, do you feel like most of that is in place, and I guess what I am trying to get at is, if you are already positioned for that, then from the client or the market share standpoint, maybe that's one of the things that's driving it, as a lot of other firms are still trying to figure things out. So wanted to get a sense of, where you guys think you're, given all these conflicting regulations, and how well you can manage them, at this point, given what you know? Harvey Schwartz : So, let me start with technology, because obviously technology has been a critical driver and part of our operating infrastructures are firm for as long as you have been covering us and well before. And that investment is not something obviously you can do in a short period of time. So this reflects decades of investment in technology platform as you know. We have talked about this in the past, Mike, we have one risk management platform SecDB, which certainly gives us some efficiencies in scale, because as we adapt, if we need to build things for our equity business, or if we need to build things in different parts of the world, it obviously goes without saying, that you can be more efficient as you replicate those things. So its that constant reinvesting in the business that gives us that flexibility, but that's not new. The regulatory component obviously, as we get into the finalization of rules and the implementation of rules, that will continue to be an ongoing process; when we think about technology away from the narrow subset of regulatory compliance, which plays obviously a mentally critical role. The other way we think about it is, really how do we deliver to clients, and that again, we continue to invest in, and then other than being efficient, are there ways we can grow revenues from technology, and so we are constantly monitoring that. Michael Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I am just going to ask a real basic question; how sustainable were your results in each of the four business lines? You already said, the investment banking backlog is a little bit less than at year-end. So as you look at it compared to the prior quarter, should we expect this higher level of performance, or is this just the usual first quarter bump and that we are going back down to a lower level? Harvey Schwartz : So lets just take Investment Banking, Mike; so you remember, at the end of last year, we talked about the fact that we had 1 trillion announced transactions and there was a $200 billion gap between us and our next closest competitor. So in the first quarter obviously, you would expect to see a certain of those transactions coming through. I would point out that the backlog is up significantly from last year. And so, in terms of the backlog in the quarter, it was down a little bit in investment banking, and then it was up across equity underwriting and it was up across debt underwriting. [Indiscernible] about the backlog, in the way that you described it, but for example, if you asked the question slightly differently, you said listen, the trend in banking, does it feel like its still in place? The short answer to that is yes; when we talk to CEOs and Boards, CEO and Board confidence continues to be high, and you've even seen in the last couple of weeks in announced transactions, there is a fair bit of activity out there, and we feel very well placed for it. Mike Mayo : And on the trading side? Harvey Schwartz : So, on the trading side I'd say the same thing; in terms of trends, this discussion around diverging monetary policies, which is a catalyst. That trend feels like its in place, and the client dialog and in terms of our communication, we are very focused. But in terms of you extrapolating that in terms of the quarter, its very early in the quarter, and so all these things, as you know, are going to be driven by the environment, and ultimately, how our clients respond to that. Mike Mayo : Then one follow-up question; the PSUs are new with an 11% hurdle for ROE and this quarter you had a 14.7% ROE. So is that PSU hurdle high enough, how did you come to that? Do you consider that kind of a target for the firm? Harvey Schwartz : I am glad you asked that question; because we have had this discussion around target. And as we said before, a call wouldn't be complete, unless we talked about something about a target with you Mike. So really important, the PSUs that you mentioned, which I am sure you saw in the proxy, that is not a target for the firm; and that's an important distinction for everyone to understand. The reason we don't have a published ROE target, is because it's just not how we manage the firm. If you recall, all the time we spent in the fourth quarter, talking about our ROE framework, in terms of how we think about capital management. That's a much better way to understand how the firm thinks about most efficiently deploying its capital. So in terms of the PSUs, as for the proxy, our Board engaged with shareholders actively as they always do, and they took that feedback in along with other constituents, and they felt like adding those metrics to certain executives in the firm, made sense from a shareholder perspective. Mike Mayo : All right thank you. Harvey Schwartz : The other thing Mike I'd say on ROE target, its interesting you know; if we'd had an ROE target out there, and again, because you and I have gone through this so many times. If we'd had a target out there, we had an 11.2% return last year. If we had a target out there of 13%, and we had our 14.7%, I don't know how you would digest that. We really view 14.7%, it\u2019s a good solid performance for the quarter, its close -- we are really in mid-teens territory now. But our aspirations to deliver for our shareholders are higher. And so -- again, that's why we don't have a specific target. We really think about how to drive value over the long run. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey, thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. One is just on the fundamental review, the trading that Basel is currently engaged in and wanted to get your thoughts on, how you see that going, and if it goes into places its currently outlined, how you deal with that? Harvey Schwartz : So we have obviously been actively involved with the regulators, as does the industry broadly on the trading book review. I think its too early to extrapolate anything from the QIS in terms of any final rule. Our discussion, we think its important -- its really about calibration in terms of how folks want to actually think about the next round of a rule set. But as you have seen us do in the past, whenever we get a final rule, we will work within that rule set. I think that -- as we think about these rules that impact businesses where we require to have inventory, again we got to think about calibration, because we need to think about market liquidity and the industry's ability to provide that, so that has been a discussion for us. Betsy Graseck : Right. Just because it feels like the hedging is a little bit clunky, not really treating risk as you would want to manage it? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah I would say, let's give regulators time on this, I don't want to pre-judge anything. There is still a lot of work to do. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, maybe speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the commodities business? We have had some recent headlines from some of the regulators on that. I know that you're very committed to a client oriented business. But could you just identify how much of -- what your commodities business generates today is client facing? Harvey Schwartz : So the driver -- I mean, our commodity is all about the clients. As you know, we have sold certain assets, and that's really the driver and when we talk about commodities within our fixed income business, that's what it is. I think -- look, its an interesting time to be having this discussion around commodities and regulation, because as we have seen really since the first quarter of last year, we start to see volatile natural gas markets, then followed by this huge decline in the energy markets over the last six plus months. I think it really reinforces the needs for firms like Goldman Sachs to be in a position to provide our clients with liquidity, with financing capacity, and so for us, as you know, we have been in the commodity business forever. We know how valuable it is to our clients, we are hugely committed to it. In terms of regulation, we will see how the regulation evolves, and again, we will stay in active dialog with the regulators. But I think at this stage, everybody sees how critical it is, and how important it is to clients. That's what I would say. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning Harvey. Question for you first of all on the buyback comment you made and the idea of backend loading, and I was wondering in the context over the last couple of years, where it has tended to be more consistent. What prompted the rethink? Is it something to do with CCAR, reinvestment opportunities that you're seeing? Just a little color on that would be helpful? Harvey Schwartz : As you know, year-to-year, the CCAR test changes. Obviously I can't speak to anything at supervisory level detail. But there were aspects and nuances of this year's tests, that to the extent to which we use our capacity, that we would use our capacity later in the year. Now this is public of course, the Federal Reserve gives you capacity on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, I was just letting you know, that due to nuances in this year's test, largely driven by the fact that we are mark-to-market firm -- we mark-to-market our balance sheet, that the -- to the extent to which we use it, it will be more back-end weighted. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. So it has more to do with that, than the idea that with business levels picking up, you're seeing more opportunities to deploy capital in the business? Harvey Schwartz : No. I was specifically speaking in a CCAR context, with the expected capacity. Of course, as you know when you look at our long history, as a firm, for the vast majority of our history, we have reinvested capital into the business, and so to the extent to which we continue to see growth in client demand, obviously that's our preference. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. Let me ask you a litigation question; you certified a $190 million in the quarter, can you give us a sense for how much of that is the reserve build versus just incurred costs? Harvey Schwartz : So we don't break it down specifically at that level. What I will tell you, it\u2019s the same process. We continue to evaluate any outstanding litigation in the course of the quarter, and we accrue accordingly. Guy Moszkowski : And how should we think about, the fact that in the most recent quarter, one of your major competitors said that they were in negotiations with the Department of Justice on private label mortgage securitizations. And really at this point, if we assume that they do what they are in negotiations to do. The only major U.S. dealer that wanted to have done one of those settlements is Goldman. Should we be thinking that there is probably going to be something coming down the line in the next few quarters, that you're in negotiations? Harvey Schwartz : So again, to the extent to which on any specific cases, we are not going to comment. I am sure you understand that. I would really encourage you to look at the most recent 10-K and our Q disclosure, where we are very explicit about all these matters. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, fair enough. And then, the final question I had for you is just on the tax rate. You talked about geography and obviously, we have seen tax rates similar to -- that you had this quarter in the past. Would it be appropriate for us to sort of factor that in together with the norm for the first quarter together, with the normal kind of low 30s and be thinking in terms of something along the lines of 30% for the full year, or would you expect this tax rate to continue? Harvey Schwartz : So it\u2019s a good question. So just for everyone who may have not had a chance to be [indiscernible] beginning of the call, effective tax rate for last year was 31.4 and for the quarter was 27.7, and as you have pointed out Guy, that was mostly driven by geographic earnings mix. What I would say is, all factors being equal, in terms of the full year rate, and the way you should think about it, given that we are starting from such a low level, I think its reasonable to assume that we come in below last year's rate. But we will see how the year evolves. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Sure, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Jim. Jim Mitchell : Just maybe circling back to FICC. FX [0:41:31] rates are very strong, which you obviously highlighted as did everybody else, credit, mortgages being weak year-over-year, but we had an environment where, I mean, I guess that if you look at sort of trace volumes being up, credit spreads were pretty stable. What's really, I guess, hurting that business, is it just simply, there wasn't enough volatility, or just absolute low rates are hurting spreads, or is it -- clearly inventory levels are down, or is it a combination of all those things. Just trying to think what is a better environment do we just need to see higher rates? Harvey Schwartz : I think this last quarter was really a case of investors evaluating, clients really evaluating, where they used to be, with respect to their portfolios. There was obviously less refinancing activity during this quarter versus a year ago. But I would say the key driver is the debate overrates and how people are thinking about their portfolios. I think if we saw a path towards normalized rates over time, I think you could see a pick-up. Jim Mitchell : Okay. So we just kind of need to wait and see rates get a little -- more conviction about rates and predictability. And just maybe a bigger picture question on the banking cycle and M&A. Clearly, we have seen a nice pickup and continued in the first quarter, where do you -- in terms of conversations with clients, do you still think there is a lot of juice left in, I think if you look at past cycle, this would imply we still have quite a bit of room to go. Just want to hear your thoughts on it, if you -- Harvey Schwartz : You're right. In terms of -- if you want to use the benchmark path cycles, certainly there is room for increased M&A activity. In terms of our discussions with CEOs and Boards, I would say that the momentum feels still quite good. There is large transactions within industries tend to be a catalyst for other transactions. Strategies are very well positioned, in terms of driving synergies, the financing markets remain attractive. Again -- so, there is room here, and our recent dialog is quite good, and as you point out, there is room versus sort of historical benchmarks. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to circle back to the equity client execution, because the result is just so discontinuous with -- though its roughly double the last, say, eight quarter moving average. I mean, can you say -- was it just a unique opportunity set, was it a couple of big transactions, was it related to the block transactions that you were talking about earlier, or is this more like the new normal? Harvey Schwartz : Look, we will see how the subsequent quarter goes. I would say that, look, if we looked at last year's first quarter, it was definitely a more challenging market-making environment. Again, this is really just one where, geographically, from a derivatives perspective, the ability to commit capital. Things just really lined up quite nicely for our franchise; and again, it was broad based. So the environment was good everywhere. Doesn't mean it can't get better and doesn't mean it can't decline, but it was good everywhere this quarter. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And then on a kind of a global macro-view back in 2011, I guess the prospect of a Greek default inside the Eurozone and crisis and we seem closer to it than ever. Is it now in your view, a non-event, if and when it happens, that everyone has had enough time and preparation to get ready for it? Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s a complicated question. I would say, first of all Greece has been in view for a long time for folks, so people have had an opportunity to digest it. I think that, on the plus side, the environment in Europe versus 2011 is dramatically different, in terms of -- if you think about the discussion around other peripheral countries relative to 2011. And so I think, those are all things on the plus side. We are obviously monitoring it very carefully. I would say, on the concerning side, look, its an experiment that hasn't been run, and so we will have to see what it has for markets. But its certainly, if we compare this to 2011, you'd have to assume that, the risk is much more contained, given people have had years to focus on this. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Brennan. Brennan Hawken : So quick one on thinking about equities here coming into 2Q, typically strong, given dividend season in Europe. How much do you think that QE on the continent is going to play into that this quarter? Harvey Schwartz : Well clearly, it was a big driver in terms of increased confidence in Europe, and you saw that immediately -- that translated immediately into big uptick in European equity markets. We will see how much pull-through that has during the course of the quarter, but clearly it has been in focus for our clients now, and so we will see how much stamina it has. But obviously the commitment to QE is substantial. Brennan Hawken : Sure. And then, sorry about bringing it back to equities here, but one more; can you just speak to what sort of impact Asia had on the quarter, particularly given some of the market structure changes we saw in the region? Harvey Schwartz : So, certainly it was a contributor, if I ranked it for you, it was -- Europe was a more significant contributor. But the trend in Asia, has been much better, obviously. And as those markets continue to liberalize, I think the dynamic nature of capital flows will continue to increase. Of course, it was helpful in Asia, but again, this was broad-based across our equity business. Longer term, we are pretty optimistic about the opportunities there though. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning Steven. Steven Chubak : So I just had a question on CCAR and your preferred issuance plans. With total capital under CCAR specifically, now the binding [ph] constraint for the firm. Even though you're already operating at that 150 basis point preferred target, is it fair to expect that you will look to close the gap, or improve your CCAR position by issuing more preferreds or more qualifying debt? Harvey Schwartz : So you may have seen, or you may not have seen, Steven, but we are actually -- we announced this morning, we are out in the market with preferred. So that transaction is out in the market now, and we will be closing later this afternoon. In terms of how we think about this, this is a great question, because as I said before, a lot of this is about how you digest the CCAR results and how you think about -- again things like, how you price the balance sheet, how you deploy your capital and the optimal capital structure. And so, you should assume we are going to look at everything, in terms of how we position the firm going forward as it relates to the capital structure, make sure we do -- we construct it in a way that's most efficient for our clients and most efficient for our shareholders. Steven Chubak : That's really helpful Harvey. And actually, in that same vein, since you mentioned about capital allocations under CCAR, it might be helpful if you could clarify, regarding how you allocate the capital under your attributable equity framework. Under CCAR lines, do you use for your stressed end of [ph] period or your minimum ratio for determining the level of required capital for assessing the adequacy of the ROEs for various trades? Harvey Schwartz : Right. So some of this obviously, we consider proprietary in terms of how we think about the dynamic nature of capital management. But for the folks who haven't studied, and obviously Steven is a very thoughtful consumer of the information. In terms of our return on attributed equity framework, what we have discussed with the marketplace, is basically all those factors that contribute to regulatory capital constraints, Basel-III advanced, standardized, supplementary leverage ratio, elements of CCAR. We had weightings [ph] to those, given their significance and we basically have constructed an algorithm that helps guide us, both in executing certain transactions, and obviously how we evaluate businesses over the long run. But we haven't discussed the specifics of how we incorporate those variables. Steven Chubak : Okay. Well that's it for me Harvey, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Matt. Matt Burnell : Good morning Harvey. Just a question for you, in terms of what's going on in the capital markets with your businesses, specifically on the energy side of things. We have heard from a number of more commercially oriented banks so far this earning season about what's going on with their borrowing and capital markets activity within that sector specifically. I am curious given what's happened in the last two to three quarters in the oil markets, have you seen a meaningful increase in those companies coming to market, or has that been much more status quo? Harvey Schwartz : I can't comment specifically in terms of the [indiscernible]. What I will say is, obviously given our role in commodities and our role -- energy companies and industrial companies broadly, the activity level for the past several quarters has been extremely high. Often what you will see is, given sort of this really very steep decline in the oil price, is, those things won't translate immediately. But over time, obviously the industry adjusts that, and then you begin to see things like merger transactions and capital actions. And so, the activity level -- the dialog is quite high, but I can't point you to any specific transactions that I would highlight. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just switching to investment management; you mentioned that there was an outflow on liquidity products. It seemed a little bit larger than what we have seen from a couple of other peers. I guess I am curious if you can just give us a little more color on that, and does -- what happened over the last couple of quarters with the flows, presume a somewhat higher normalized pre-tax margin in that business, relative to the high teens that you typically put up? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of the flow, as we said, there was $13 billion of combined net inflows and market appreciation, offset by $14 billion in liquidity outflows. Those flows can move around, as clients reallocate assets and move back and forth. I think if you look at the historical movement around those predominantly mutual fund assets, you will see flows like this historically, so I wouldn't point to any meaningful indicator. In terms of the margins of the business, obviously this business remains strategically a very high priority for us. We have been investing in it for years, and we continue to see progress; and over time, we expect that you will see margin expansion. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally for me, was there any material change this quarter versus the fourth quarter in the benefit to your Basel III ratios from a significant financial institution deduction that you said was about $5 billion last quarter? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, that's not the key driver in this quarter. It really is the growth in equity. It\u2019s a [indiscernible] driving it this quarter. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital ratios; can you give us what the fully phased-in capital ratios are, what's the RWAs? Harvey Schwartz : Sure. So fully phased-in is 11.8 and 10.6. Now again, we just got a question on the significant clients for institutional deduction, and so when you look at that, that between the transitional, I would say, the best way to think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, assuming all other factors being equal, you should assume that the fully phased-in versus transitional would roughly be around the midpoint of that, because we get the benefit of the significant institutional deduction, as we move money out of funds. In terms of RWAs on the quarter, for advanced $565 million, and standardized $626 million. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And towards the [indiscernible] 5.3% and the kind of the constraint ratio for CCAR has moved up the total capital. Do you have a sense of what the buffer is that you would run the SLR [ph] at now, could you get away with a 50 basis point buffer, since the total seems to be constraining? Harvey Schwartz : We haven't finalized a buffer in terms of how we are thinking about that. And so, we will have to see how that evolves, in terms of how we want to think about it. But obviously, there has been significant progress, and we are above the 2018 minimum requirement. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. All right, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in its balance sheet size. And so I am wondering how -- if we should be thinking about that differently at all, at this stage, given what you're talking about, with respect to client interest and demands, but relative to the capital constraints that were highlighted under the CCAR and I am assuming were the genesis for today's preferred offering. How should we think about all of the dynamics with respect to balance sheet size? Harvey Schwartz : So the balance sheet reduction we went through last year, it\u2019s a great -- I am glad you brought it up. That was about repricing the balance sheet, and all about this framework we talked about, in terms of how we deploy our marginal capital. And so, if you think again about last year's test, you could grow equity, you could grow capital, but the reality is, you obviously -- you want to do that in a way that delivers marginal returns. And so, that was all about repricing, and so as we went through an exercise last year, that was repricing [indiscernible]. If we again -- our preferred operating position would be to grow the capital base, grow the balance sheet accretively and deploy that capital to clients. but obviously, we are going to be very sensitive to returns on that, and how that marginal balance sheet gets priced. Eric Wasserstrom : But it sounds like, from your repricing commentary, you do see that at least on the margin occurring? Harvey Schwartz : Correct. Well we certainly have seen some in terms of pricing, and then last year, we felt the discipline of the process we went through -- went quite well, as we talked about, there was very little disruption to client activity. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Devin. Devin Ryan : Good morning. Just one the ROE outlook and the drivers, obviously your margin is a big one, and the pretax margin for all of last year is 36%. It was 37% this quarter, which I thought was impressive. So we just look at the businesses, that have more of a granular level, are there are areas where you feel like you're getting to about as good as it will be, and then where do you see the biggest areas for additional leverage to the margin? Harvey Schwartz : So the discussion around how we manage the businesses and where we think about driving additional leverage, that's a continual conversation at Goldman Sachs that's going to happen all the time; because we are always reviewing the businesses, and making sure we are driving them to the ultimate outcome. Now, to the operating leverage you're seeing, that's firm-wide, and really is the result of, again, the years of investment we made in technology, how we scaled the resources, the cost cutting programs that we announced several years ago that was raised, and several billion dollars. And so, you are now just starting to see all that translate through. But we are constantly evaluating the businesses for opportunities, both to grow and to hold. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thanks, and then just coming back to Europe one last time, the stability that's helping client activity, is there any way you can just help size that for us relative to the recent past; how much stronger was it this quarter, we talked about derivatives, but where else does that pickup, and any perspective around how much bigger it was this quarter, relative to the recent past? Harvey Schwartz : So I highlighted it to give you some sense of the underpinnings of the activity that's driving it. But again, in equities, it really was broad-based client activity, geographic and across the business and within individual product lines. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Devin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein : Yes hi. Just coming back to equity derivatives, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more flavor in terms of products, if the strengths on the execution side came maybe more from the flow side, or was it more from the delta one side or structuring side or dividend swaps; can you just talk a little bit through the products in order for us to get a better understanding of what we should think about going forward trends, in some of these areas? Because clearly, some of them are a bit more bulky than others, if I may? Harvey Schwartz : Really Kian, its truly client activity across each of the businesses. So I wouldn't highlight any particular product line within the derivative businesses. Obviously, when you have a big up move in European equity markets like you did with QE, obviously that's an opportunity for clients to get involved, and there is lots of things they look at, both from a [indiscernible] perspective and a more structured perspective. I think if you try and answer your question around things like where, people are more interested in derivatives that had maybe multi-variables, sure. But again, it was broad-based, it wasn't any one particular driver. Kian Abouhossein : And there is no real distinction between structuring with this flow, in terms of -- your mix not much significantly changed? Harvey Schwartz : I won't talk to our mix, because the firm obviously, we have the intellectual capital on the systems, and the capacity to point that capital for clients. And so, I think we are always well positioned for those parts of the cycles in the market. But again, broad-based in equities. Kian Abouhossein : Yeah. And in respect to fixed income, we have had some things giving us a bit of a steer in terms of how the revenues breakdown between macro and credit, and I was wondering, could you give us a bit of a feeler as well? Is it half-half at this point in the first quarter, or should we think about it differently? Harvey Schwartz : We don't provide a detail by macro versus credit. What I would say is that -- look, we have an investment in all these businesses, and again, we benefited from the diversity. At times, credits can be particularly active, and at times, macro is going to be particularly active. But we don't provide disclosure in terms of that split. Kian Abouhossein : And lastly, on commodities. Clearly, commodities had an uptick in volatility, but at the same time, you highlight volatility as a business which year-on-year was down. I am just wondering, if you could just explain a little bit to me, why commodities was relatively weak on a year-on-year basis? Harvey Schwartz : So you may recall that last year, and I was going back to the first quarter 2014, commodities had a very strong quarter, a lot of that is we discussed at the time, was due to the extraordinary volatility of natural gas. And it drove a lot of client activity in the sector, and that was really the first time you and I started talking about the fact, that we were really seeing the absence of competitors on the field, and a huge uptick in client dialog. And so you're just coming off a very strong 2014 first quarter, but commodities remains a very active space for us, and our dialog with clients is quite strong. Kian Abouhossein : Okay. That explains it. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Kian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thank you. I want to ask you, one thing that you highlighted in the press release was the largest ever NPL -- largest increase in five years in tangible book value. Would the increase in returns and still continue constraints on capital deployment, isn't that really a fundamental accelerator, as you look forward over the next couple of years? Harvey Schwartz : So again, the environment is going to -- ultimately something that we participate in. But I would say that again, the thing that we have focused on over the last several years, which has been making sure that we continue to invest in our client franchise, and at the same time, build operating leverage. That's why you're seeing that. You're seeing the 14% year-over-year growth in quarterly revenues, and its just translating to the bottom line, with a lot of operating leverage. Marty Mosby : And then, when you look at the comp ratio at 42%, once you made some improvement with what you've done in the past, but when you look at it on the average for the year, you have recently highlighted, then on the 38% kind of number. In that, you would look for the year being closer to what you've done in the past couple of years. When you see that you almost have $0.50, $0.60 of earnings per share that's basically pushed forward as you review performance in your compensation plans over the rest of the year? Harvey Schwartz : So its our best estimate today, Mosby, and we will evaluate the year as we go through and obviously again, as we have discussed in the past, the culture of pay for performance at Goldman Sachs will evaluate it continuously as we go through, and it will be driven by performance. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Mosby. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I will be able to and other members of senior management, we will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call. Take care now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 16, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane E. Holmes - Head- Investor Relations : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control.

For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and year-to-date results then I'm happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $9.1 billion, net earnings $1 billion, earnings per diluted share $1.98, and our annualized return on common equity was 4.8%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $19.7 billion, net earnings $3.9 billion, earnings per diluted share $7.93, and our annualized return on common equity was 9.7%. In the second quarter, we recorded net provisions for mortgage related litigation and regulatory matters of $1.45 billion. Despite these charges, book value per common share was up 4% relative to year-end 2014. Excluding these litigation charges, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $4.75, and our annualized return on common equity was 11.5%. The second quarter of 2015 was another example of the benefits that come with having a diversified global client franchise. Certain businesses showed year-over-year strengths while others faced headwinds. Investment Banking and Investment Management net revenues increased year-over-year by 13% and 14% respectively. The increase in net revenues within these primarily fee-based business s largely offset net revenue declines and are more capital-intensive businesses with a 6% year-over-year decline in Institutional Client Services and a 13% year-over-year decline in Investing and Lending. The benefits of diversity were even demonstrated at a business level. For example, strength in advisory and equity underwriting more than offset the year-over-year decline in debt underwriting, which was lower versus a record last year. And for Institutional Client Services, revenue strength within equities helped offset a difficult operating environment for FICC. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from our diverse set of market leading businesses. If you look at our first half results, excluding the $1.45 billion litigation charge in the second quarter of 2015, you can see the embedded operating leverage, with expenses flat relative to revenues that are up 7% compared to last year. You can also see the improvement in several underlying performance metrics. These include a 440 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin, a 27% increase in net earnings, a 31% increase to diluted earnings per share, and finally, a 220 basis point improvement in ROE, to 13.1%. Now I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter revenues of $2 billion, 6% higher than a strong first quarter. We continue to see the benefit of our leading global franchise, with second quarter revenues at the highest level since 2007. Our Investment Banking backlog was down slightly compared to the first quarter and remained higher year-over-year. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $821 million. The 15% decrease relative to the first quarter reflects a decrease in completed M&A. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including BHP Billiton's $12.7 billion demerger of South32; Synageva Biopharma's $8.4 billion sale to Alexion Pharmaceuticals; and Imperial Tobacco Group's $7.1 billion acquisition of certain cigarette brands and other assets of Reynolds American and Lorillard. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter. These include BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; Altera Corporation's $16.7 billion sale to Intel Corporation; and Pall Corporation's $13.8 billion sale to Danaher Corporation. Moving to underwriting, revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter, up 27% sequentially, primarily due to debt issuance. This was our second highest quarterly performance in underwriting. Year-to-date, we ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings. Equity underwriting revenues of $595 million rose 12% compared to the first quarter, due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues of $603 million improved 47% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by an increase in leverage finance activity. During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs. Leading Qualcomm's $10 billion debt IPO, Daiichi Sankyo's $3.2 billion sale of its stake in Sun Pharmaceutical, and AIG's $3.5 billion sale of its stake in AerCap. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equity businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 34% compared to the seasonally-stronger first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and include $153 million of DBA gains. Net revenues were down substantially from the first quarter, as client activity declined across our businesses and market-making conditions were more difficult. Within interest rates and currencies, a shifting macro backdrop negatively impacted client activity and results. While currency has experienced a significant decline, client activity and interest rates, though sequentially lower, remain solid. Credit was significantly lower, as credit spreads generally widened during the second quarter and activity levels declined. Mortgages also declined versus the first quarter, as volatility and client activity remained generally low. Commodities decreased significantly, with reduced levels of volatility and client activity. In Equities, which includes Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, down 14% quarter-over-quarter and included $32 million in DBA gains. Equities Client Execution net revenues decreased 30% sequentially, to $787 million. Client activity levels remained high this quarter, though not as high as the first quarter. Commissions and fees were $767 million, down 5% relative to the first quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $443 million, up 13% sequentially, reflecting seasonally-stronger client activity and higher customer balances. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $77 million, down from $81 million in the first quarter, reflecting a decrease in commodities and interest rates. Moving on to our Investing and Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion, primarily reflecting strong corporate performance and company-specific events in private equity, as well as net gains in public equities. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $547 million, with roughly $225 million in net interest income, and the balance coming from net gains. In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 4% from the first quarter. This represented the second highest quarterly performance for Investment Management. Management and other fees were up 4% sequentially, to a record $1.25 billion. Revenues benefited from a higher average mix of long-term fee-based products relative to liquidity products. Assets under supervision increased $5 billion, to a record $1.182 trillion. Long-term net inflows of $14 billion, largely driven by fixed income products, were somewhat offset by net market depreciation of $3 billion and net outflows of $6 billion in liquidity products. Moving to performance, across the global platform, 76% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year and a five-year basis. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was again accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were 59% higher than the first quarter. Substantially all of the increase was related to litigation charges. Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,900 up 1% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31.2%. Our global core of liquid assets averaged $181 billion. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 11.8% using standardized approach. It was 12.5% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.7%. And finally, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for $245 million in the second quarter. As discussed last quarter, related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next four quarters will be back-end weighted. In closing, a few comments. The second quarter of 2015 provided its share of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, our results reflect a continuation of some positive macro trends. Our Investment Banking clients remain focused on their strategic alternatives. There is also a strong demand for financing solutions. We see solid client activity in equity products, particularly outside of the United States, and there was a growing need for active investment management options. On the other hand, the operating environment for our FICC clients was more challenged in the second quarter. The combination of current concern surrounding Greece's widening credit spreads and the reversal of certain macro trends led to lower client activity and a more difficult operating environment. More recently, market participants have been focused on the Chinese economy. This follows the more than 30% decline in the Shanghai Index during the early part of July from peak levels in June. Against this mixed backdrop, we remain focused on driving value for our shareholders. Year-to-date, excluding litigation charges, we have posted strong results in many of our key investor metrics, including earnings per share, ROE, and book value per share. As we have mentioned many times before, our management team isn't overly focused on any one quarter or, for that matter, any six month period. Our focus is on the strength of our global client franchise, the quality of our people, and the long term trends driving our businesses. Regarding trends, we see many opportunities ahead. For example, the competitive landscape is in significant flux. In addition to strengthening the banking system, one of the positive things the regulation has achieved is leveling the competitive playing field. The world changed after 2008. We began to adapt to this new world immediately, and particularly to comply with new regulations. As part of this process we also scrutinized each of our businesses with the goal of both improving the client experience and our ability to generate appropriate shareholder returns. We started early, we cut costs, we on-boarded new regulations, we sold businesses, and we developed a new capital framework. At the same time, we have been able to both expand and deepen our global client franchise. As much as we are focused on the present, we are also focused on the future, and we enter it knowing we have a great set of businesses, we have tremendous client relationships, we have world-class people and execution capabilities, and last but not least, we have an improving competitive and operating landscape. Thank you again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks very much. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI : Good morning. So pretty darn good all around. I think FICC and I&L take a lot of everyone's focus, but in FICC specifically, I wonder if you could help us, how much of that was a late quarter phenomenon? You spelled out what fell off in credit and mortgage, things like that. How much was a late quarter? How much have you seen some stabilization or reversal so far? And then most importantly, I think last quarter you felt really good about market share in client facilitation side of the business, and I'm curious if you can give any comments on parsing that out, the facilitation versus the marks in the quarter? Thank you. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So in terms of timing of the quarter, we came off a strong first quarter, as you mentioned, and then we came in basically you saw a number of factors. I think the most significant one, obviously, Greece in the headlines continuously. And that certainly weighed on spread sensitive parts of the business like credit and mortgages. Early in the quarter, obviously, there was a big reversal in the macro trend with respect to how people were thinking about currencies and interest rates. And that was really more an interest rate differential and what's the Fed going to do discussion. And so it's not surprising that we saw reduced client activity in the quarter and obviously more difficult market-making environment. In terms of \u2013 it was really more pronounced as the quarter went along as Greece really dominated the headlines and liquidity was challenged in parts of the market. And so it was really \u2013 it was more of an end of quarter phenomenon. Too early to tell in terms of where we are in this quarter, Glenn, but obviously, the news around Greece has been obviously very positive in the last couple of days. And so hopefully some of these trends are behind us. Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI : And then I think you talked about the competitive landscape in flux and we all see what's going on at each and every one of the European banks. I think your franchise composition is different in general. You see it in results this quarter, and mostly good. Just a question on the European shrinking. Do you want what they're shrinking? In other words, theoretically, they're going to shrink the tougher parts, the lower ROA types of the business. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So in terms of how we think about it, and obviously these competitive trends they take years to really formulate. But I think the big change and I talked about this a little bit in my script, but to be more specific about it, the capital-intensive parts of the business and really let's just start with the fixed income parts of the business, given the regulatory demands around that part of the business to deliver for your clients and drive appropriate returns for shareholders, that is actually where we think the competitive advantage is most significant. So if you just look at last year's collective industry ROEs, which are in the mid to higher single digits. Our relative position both the strength and the franchise but aggregate position of the firm just positions us quite well over the next couple of years if firms follow through on what they saying and they actually restructure and they begin to redesign those businesses. And so, as people exit the business, obviously, the impact of the marginal pressure on risk when you're deploying capital should be beneficial and we're leaders in all those parts of the franchise, but I think this is going to be a multi-year phenomenon. Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI : Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there might be more volatility, but in the end, your shareholders are going to love the fact that you are bigger in some of those areas. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we feel very confident about the business. That's the way I would describe it. Glenn P. Schorr - Evercore ISI : All right, thanks. I respect the one and one. Thank you. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Good morning, Christian. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. So my first question is on the CCAR and G-SIB \u2013 possible G-SIB's surcharges. So I'm sure you're aware that this chatter that that could be included in the CCAR process going forward. You know, you have been or Goldman has been pretty proactive in optimizing for CCAR, be it preferred issuance or reducing the gross balance sheet, but what are the levers can you pull if G-SIB buffers are included? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So as you pointed out, we obviously have been pretty dynamic with respect \u2013 I think the greatest example was a year ago when we brought the balance sheet down by nearly $60 million in the quarter. And that was predominately driven by CCAR and that was a repricing exercise, which led us to do that. So the way we'll think about this is a couple ways. First of all, it's only preliminary and we'll have to see the final rule, but our expectation is that at this stage given the information that we have, again preliminary, that any incremental buffer will be roughly 1%. And so, relative to the peer group, obviously, that puts us in a good position. Now in terms of how to think about the implications for the test, we have no visibility into how the Federal Reserve is going to change the test. And so to the extent to which it changes, we'll look at all the same levers again. There will be an evaluation of how we should think about the capital structure of the firm, how we should think about how we're deploying our capital, how we think about pricing the marginal balance sheet and other aspects of our business. But we won't do that in advance of any changes in any regulatory rules. And we just don't know what they're going to do yet. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then litigation costs, so how should we think about go-forward litigation costs? I guess over the last four quarters, you've averaged about $200 million per quarter, just given the big charge this quarter, all else equal, should we expect that run rate to slow down a bit? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So obviously, we took a significant charge this quarter. The vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. But the process with respect to these kind of legacy cost issues is, every quarter, based on the best information available, we create our best estimate and it's very case-by-case dependent. And so it can be somewhat unpredictable quarter-to-quarter. That's how I'd frame it for you. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So it doesn't sound like anything changes in terms of just kind of look forward here? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'm sure you understand this, Christian, given that these are \u2013 this is active litigation, very difficult for me to comment beyond what I said. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's fair. Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks so much, Christian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, Harvey. Thanks a lot. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Mike. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Just on the equity trading, so year-over-year, the strength was pretty significant. I think you mentioned a few drivers of that. But just wanted to get a sense, are you seeing any, either market share gains in that part of the business or is it more environment and clients' investors getting more active in the asset class? I know you pointed to Asia, but I just wanted to find out if there was anything else driving that? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I think, obviously, it has been a good solid couple of quarters. Environmentally, for the first half of the year, the environment has clearly been better, both from a activity level and also from a market-making perspective, and so you're seeing that. The franchise is very diverse, both geographically and product line. And so I think when market activity picks up, you're just seeing the value of the franchise pull through. And as I said earlier, as activity has picked up outside of the U.S., I can't tell necessarily whether or not it's share pickup from other firms, but obviously, you've seen actually in the first quarter even, those firms with strong equity franchises seem to be getting the lion's share of the activity. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. And then just two kind of minor items, but on the legal cost, you mentioned this reserve, and it's always tough in terms of the outlook. But when you think about some of the major things that you guys have put behind you, and even the industry, when we think about the run rate going forward, are the majority of those items behind you? And then on the tax rate, just wanted to understand, if I exclude the item related to the legal reserve, it looks like the core tax rate still was relatively low versus expectations, in line with last quarter. So is the revenue mix away from the legal charge still beneficial? Meaning it's still coming in in lower jurisdictions? And so does that, for the full year, should we be thinking about that continuing? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So with respect to tax, you're right. It's roughly consistent with the first quarter and we're running below last year's full year, so you're right about that. That's both earnings-mix driven, and an election. You'll see in the earnings release this quarter with respect to certain earnings that we'll leave overseas. With respect to litigation, again, the charge we took this quarter is \u2013 the vast majority of that is related to the RMBS Working Group. And I'd really encourage you to look through our disclosure, and while I wish I could give you more detail, obviously, that's one significant item, a legacy item, that we look forward to getting behind us. But I really can't comment in more detail on that, given it's a live discussion. Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Mike \u2013 Matt, sorry. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Maybe a bigger picture question, on your traditional bank strategy, you had a key hire on the consumer side, or former consumer person. Maybe just talk about what you're thinking there on traditional bank strategy in general? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, yeah, as everyone saw, we hired Harit and we're thrilled to have someone of his experience and caliber on board as a one of our partners. I would say at this stage, it's very early days and we've really done two things. We've identified a potential opportunity and we've identified a key hire, as I said, which we're very excited about. When we look at new opportunities what we look for in terms of making that evaluation is, what core competencies do we have and how can we bring them to any client base that we deal with. And so, we feel like there is a couple of strengths here that we have. One, we have a long history and a core competency in risk management. Two, we have a very, very big commitment to technology. Three, historically, we've been pretty good builders of new businesses. And, obviously, as it relates to, let's just call it the space of digitally-led consumer finance, we have no legacy cost, we have no legacy infrastructure to deal with. And so to the extent to which we can work with Harit and develop a strategy, which we believe is accretive to the firm and valuable to clients, we'll pursue it. But at this stage, it's early days. Harit's just on board, and so we'll be back to you with more details as things develop. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then maybe separately, you mentioned head count was up just 1% linked quarter. Year-over-year, it's up 8%. Obviously, it's not causing any expense pressure as the expense management's been good, but just remind us just where those people are being added? And I guess are they more kind of junior, lower salaried staff? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, the 1% increase in the quarter and the longer term increase it's really happening in two places. Part of it is driven by our growth in the Investment Management business and people that we've been adding there as that business continues to grow and our ongoing investment there. And really the other large portion of it relates to resources that we needed to deploy as we come into the more significant part of regulatory compliance. And so, these are all the new rules that the industry is affected by over the next couple of years. And so it's a bit of a surge, if you will, in terms of having people on board. And for example in the second quarter, about three-quarters of those folks were in places like Salt Lake City, Bangalore, and other locations. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sorry, three-quarters of the people in the reg-related staff or of the additions? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Of the additions. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. How are you? Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good. I just had a couple of quick questions. One was on the G-SIFI buffer that you talked about earlier on the call. I just wanted to see \u2013 did you give us an update on what you think your surcharge is? I thought you were \u2013 before the most recent commentary it was like 2.5%. Are you saying now it's 2%? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, no. Same. No change. We don't have any incremental information. We think it's \u2013 obviously, we started with 1.5%. Under the proposal, we believe there's an incremental 100 (29:17), but again, I cautioned you that's the preliminary. We haven't seen the final rule, obviously. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. All right. Just wanted to make sure of that. And then on European competitors fading some of these businesses over time, how much does that matter to you when you think about the fact that the SIFI surcharge is in part a relative charge? So they fade naturally, you're going to grow as a percentage of total business. How much room is there to take on new business given the way the SIFI surcharge is structured? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it's a great question, Betsy, and obviously, a difficult one to think about over the next couple of years. But obviously there may be some unevenness in the playing field depending on how the rules actually get rolled out. But in the end, it's more about I think how you deploy that capital and the returns you're able to generate. And I think one of the reasons why, as you point out, we're seeing potential big restructurings on the European side is that even without the SIFI charge potential that we have in the United States \u2013 and who knows what they'll do over time, maybe the playing field will be completely level \u2013 they're struggling in those businesses at current capital levels. (30:35). Now, our commitment to Europe is very significant. And it's not just across the capital intensive businesses, but it's the entire integration of banking. And when you think about Europe over the next several years as they work through what is \u2013 our research folks have them at 1.5% growth, but as they work themselves more and more away from the crisis, this is a very good environment for a firm like Goldman Sachs where clients need sound advice across all of our businesses. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yup. No, I get that. All right. Hey, thanks. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Mike. How are you? Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Good. You ended your prepared remarks saying the world changed in 2008, you cut costs, you implemented regulation and the implication is others are now catching up, implying a little more bit rational pricing, which you've said on prior calls. Can you just give us a description of the areas where you're seeing the biggest repricing or the areas that you're watching the most? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it's a great question, Mike. And I think it's very clear at this stage that the increased regulatory requirements, however you think about them, but let's just think mostly in terms of capital, while obviously very good for the system and significant improvement for all firms. For example, Goldman Sachs was carrying 85% more capital than we did prior to the crisis. As we said, they have leveled the playing field a bit, but even without the leveling of the playing field, it makes balance sheet at one point, depending on the metric, and capital itself more expensive. And so, I don't know if it's an intended or unintended consequence in terms of the regulation, but the regulation does reprice things. And the vast majority of the industry is really a handful of us that are earning above the cost of capital, whatever you want to call it \u2013 8%, 9%, 10%. And so we're starting to see repricing come through now. We saw it mostly in balance sheet. Came a little slower than we would've liked, but it's starting to come through in balance sheet. By balance sheet I mean things like those businesses that were maybe most mispriced relative to the new requirements. Things like the repo business, it's extended into the prime brokerage business. Again, that's a regulatory heavy business. We're world-class in that business, but it is regulatory heavy business. And you have seen it in parts of the derivative business particularly in things like those transactions requiring or not requiring collateral. So I'd say it's slow. These are not huge needle movers, but this feels like a trend that's in place for a number of years. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : So would you call this as an increase in your cost of goods sold that you're passing on to customers? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think that's probably a reasonable way to say it. I mean our clients are very sophisticated. And when you sit down with them and you say, listen, everyone in the industry, Mike, that issues preferred they are issuing them slightly north of 5%. That's expensive shareholder capital to fund the leverage of your balance sheet. And so, it's pretty easy to explain to people how actually the returns that you have to require on business. And so what we think will happen over time is potentially repricing, but also the competitive dynamic looks like one where those firms that can't deliver or can't respond or don't have the same quality franchise, they get removed. But anyway, this is going to be a \u2013 this will be a long process. We went through a pretty substantial repricing as you know (34:17) last year. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And last follow up on this. Can you give a sense of magnitude? Are we talking basis point or tens of basis points or what? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Too soon to quantify. As I said, this is not big needle moving. It's more, I would describe it more as a trend for the balance sheet and capital intensive parts of the business. And you'd expect it given the regulatory constraints, so. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Yeah, good morning. I don't want to beat a dead horse, but on the litigation question, the litigation charge, presumably to add that much based on the Working Group issues that you referred to, there must have been an event, a point in your discussions with them that began to give you a sense for a figure. And I was just wondering if that's a correct assumption? And also does your view of kind of the your \u2013 where your litigation reserve stands now relative to what you will ultimately need, is that affected in anyway by the New York Court of Appeals judgment on statute of limitations which came down during the quarter? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So again, and I'd like to share more with you but obviously this is active discussion. With respect to this quarter, again, every quarter we incorporate all the information we have, Guy. And obviously we received information that resulted in us taking this charge. I know you've looked and you've read all of our financial disclosures in the past. And so I would encourage you to go back to that. But as you know, based on that we have not historically taken reserves for the RMBS Working Group. And so obviously we got information during the course of the quarter that led to this realization. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then on, just to follow up on an answer that you gave earlier. That 1% that you gave in terms of the G-SIB buffer, which I think what you were saying was that is your working assumption as to how much would go into the CCAR, sort of the increase, the stress minimum in CCAR. Is that right? So you're thinking that 1% out of your 2.5% G-SIB buffer is how much you think is likely to get added to the stress minimum in CCAR? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, again, the 1% was based on the preliminary. We'll have to see the final rule, so I really want to emphasize that. In terms of CCAR, we just don't know how they're going to include it, what they will do, whether it will be offset. We have no visibility and we'll all hear when the Federal Reserve announces any changes that they plan to make. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Fair enough. And then just one more if I might just on the SLR. You made a lot of progress on your SLR in the quarter relative to where your core equity tier 1 ratios moved. So you are now 70 basis points ahead of the minimum. You increased 40 basis points in the quarter. Can you give a sense of some of the things that you did presumably to the denominator to continue to tighten up there? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so on the SLR, the 70 basis points, if you break that down, roughly 20 basis points really comes from capital and the issuance of preferred and then the balance are all things that drive the ratio, things like notional (38:10), collateral back and forth and things like derivative. And so, there's a lot of give and gets in there but accretive for the quarter. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Jim. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Maybe just circling back to equities in China, we've had a \u2013 obviously as you pointed out, a big selloff and most of you and your peers have talking about equities being driven by strength in Asia. Have you seen any change in the environment and activity levels given the big selloff, or has that just helped \u2013 the volatility helped? Just trying to think through how that should be thought of going forward in terms of the equity franchise. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So again, whenever you see these kind of market reactions, obviously, it has some impact in terms of how clients think through their portfolios. It's more isolated, obviously, to the onshore market. And I think that \u2013 at this stage, I would describe it as being pretty fluid and dynamic with respect to the near term. I think longer term, what we're really focused on is the extent to which the recent events, do they really have a significant negative impact from an economic perspective or in terms of the liberalization policies, because obviously we have a very big focus on China, a big commitment there. And our early read of all this is that it's not going to have a big \u2013 when we talk to our research folks, it's not going to have a big impact on the local economy, and we don't expect a major change in sort of the focus on liberalization. And given everything China's done, maybe we should expect as they go through this, there were (39:51) going to be growing pains from year to year, but the long term trend feels okay to us. From a... James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah, that's \u2013 okay. That's helpful. And maybe just circling back to the \u2013 I know it's early days on the lending side, but historically, you guys have shied away from retail risk, right, with regulatory and higher legal risk. This seems to be a bit of a departure from that historical viewpoint. So could you maybe just walk us through your \u2013 clearly there's an opportunity to make money, but the question is how you view the potentially higher risk in a retail lending format? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So we've always been very cautious, and you're right to point that out. Now we do have millions of clients that touch us in our investment management business through our mutual funds every day. And so they're actually a big part of what we do. And when we think about it, obviously, we're going to move very cautiously in the space and make sure we get things right, because you're right to point out that, like any new business, there are risks and we want to make sure that we work with the consumers and the regulators in absolutely a first-class and best-class way. And so \u2013 but again, too early for us to identify any specific parts of the market. But we'll be back to you with more details again down the road. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey. Good morning, Brennan. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : So first question, you made some reference to it earlier when you talked a little bit about pricing, but it looks like we're seeing some momentum in your Prime Brokerage business. Clearly, the current quarter was a bit seasonal. But could you give some color to that? Is some of it down to pricing? Is it down to other factors? Maybe, could you help us out a little around there? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I really think there's two drivers. The biggest driver is just the quality of the franchise. And so, we've been a beneficiary of getting balances just because of the \u2013 really the longstanding history and our involvement in this business, and it's global for us. But pricing is an important input, but it's not the primary driver of the performance. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And on I&L, pretty solid, especially given some of the action we saw in markets this quarter. Can you \u2013 was a lot of it harvesting? Were there any particular regions that contributed? For example, was Asia a contributor in the quarter on the I&L line? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, in terms of I&L, and why don't I just run through it, I can run through it from the debt line through the equity line. So in the debt line we had $547 million, roughly $550 million in revenues in the quarter. And remember, I underscore for you there that roughly $225 million of that is interest income, okay, and the rest is gains in sales. In the equity line, of the $1.25 billion, roughly a third of that actually comes from public market shares that we own, in entities we've already taken public. And so there you're just seeing the idiosyncratic performance of the portfolio. And another third \u2013 and I'll just break it down for you in thirds \u2013 a third is the public portfolio performance. A third is things that we refer to as event-driven, like actually taking a company public or making a sale, and the other third is performance-driven. And so the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio, the team is just doing a very good job here. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific. Thanks for that color, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Hey, Harvey, earlier you mentioned that you saw that liquidity was challenged in parts of the market when you were talking about the FICC business. Can you give a little bit further color as to maybe what regions and which products that we saw the liquidity dry up? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, it was most challenging in Europe. The credit market in particular, and let's just say the spread sensitive product, the markets aren't as deep there, obviously, as they are in the United States. And then, with all the issues with Greece, liquidity was quite challenging for all of our clients, and quite challenging for market makers. Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then also in Europe, are you impacted by the UK bank tax and the higher \u2013 it looked like \u2013 if you look at the Goldman Sachs International? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, so it's an important part of our business, obviously, given our presence in Europe. Too early for me to quantify anything for you, but obviously the tax rate's going up over there. Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: But is that $2 billion that you had in profit on ordinary activity before taxes in Goldman Sachs International the right number to look at when you're thinking about the potential impact on tax rates? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I have to come back to you on that in terms of exactly the number you look at. I believe the answer to that is yes, but why don't I have Dane follow up with you, and we'll make sure we reconcile that for you. Brian M. Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Harvey, a couple of follow-ups, please. On your non-comp, core non-comp expenses, it looks like they came in under the consensus estimate by about $120 million this quarter. Should we consider all of that improvement to be core, or did some of it perhaps relate to slowing volume or activity over the course of the period? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, not driven by slowing activity. Any changes in non-comp that you're seeing away, obviously, from the legacy charge, that would have to do with impairments that we might take from time-to-time, is the real driver there. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And in terms of the incentive fees in the Investment Management segment, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier, but did you explain why they were so strong in this quarter, because that's not typically seasonally the case? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So there's always two drivers to incentive fees. There's going to be the normal or what we'll call year-end incentive fees that you're used to seeing. And then there are fund specific events where we've above a certain performance metric and then we'll begin to recognize those fees. And so this is very fund specific in terms of this quarter. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And just lastly, one of the metrics that we, and I imagine others use to gain some insight into the M&A outlook is the index of CEO Confidence which has been generally moving in a straight line up until recently where it took a dip down. I'm guessing may be because of Greece and other macro events, but I'm wondering does that index accurately reflect the tenor of conversations that you've been having with \u2013 in corporate board rooms over the past few weeks? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So when we talk to our M&A bankers, the momentum in the advisor side of the business feels very strong. The CEOs and boards are obviously going to incorporate all the relevant news and so not surprising to me that when you see Greece dominating the headlines and lots of volatility in the markets that you might see some dip in confidence. But in terms of the degree of conversations we're having in the activity levels, it feels quite good. And you see that halfway through the year, in announced transactions, the Investment Banking team is actually we have announced $112 billion plus of transactions, actually more than the next competitor. And so the dialogue for us with our clients is pretty robust right now. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Good morning. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Dick. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Hi. This is more of an accounting question. Basically, your Investment Banking was up quarter-over-quarter, commissions and fees were up, your principal transactions were up, and obviously there was a big jump in your debt underwriting. And yet there was almost a $200 million drop in your net interest income. And I'm just wondering why that would be? what are the accounting recognition that would allow that to happen? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So you're looking at the GAAP income statement, Dick, obviously. And that has a lot to do with under the GAAP rules, how we have to treat certain hedges versus the portfolios. We have to break out certain hedges and move them into the market making business. So it ends up being a net offset. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: I see. So this is interest income loss on hedging? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : (48:48) The hedges are hedging parts of the portfolio, so you might get a decrease in the underlying, for example, the income being driven by the portfolio, but then you pick it up in the hedges offsetting that portfolio in the market making business. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. But the market making in the FICC side of the business was down 49% so... Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. That may be completely unrelated to the interest component. That's why in the script, Dick, I break out for you in the investing and lending segment, that net interest income was $225 million in the lending businesses to try and clarify it. I'm happy to have Dane walk you through it but it's an accounting aspect. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then the second question would be, basically, I understand trading is not totally related to underwriting, but when you have such an incredibly strong increase in underwriting of a certain segment like that, and at the same point in time the FICC income goes down fairly substantially, it would suggest that what you're underwriting is something that isn't traded? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I wouldn't draw that conclusion. Usually the secondary activity flows for a long period of time, Dick. I think it's hard to draw those kind of conclusions in an individual quarter. I think if you look at our that debt underwriting activity in the first quarter, it wasn't as strong as the second quarter, but yet the FICC results were stronger. And so, if you look at FICC, for example, on a year-to-date basis, it's down. But the second quarter was definitely tougher for us, Dick. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Steve. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So, Harvey, given the challenging market making backdrop that you experienced in 2Q, I was wondering how that informed your thinking around the issue of trading liquidity more broadly. And I might be interested in hearing some of your thoughts regarding the recent feedback that we've heard from regulators as well as some of the results based on their recently-conducted studies. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, obviously, there has been a whole host of discussion around liquidity in the markets. And I think in the end, I think it leaves us quite frankly all with more questions more than answers. I think you can point to some very specific parts of the market where you can say regulation has impacted liquidity. I think, the best example of that is the government bond repo market. I think it's hard after that to point to a specific regulation and say, oh, this regulation has impacted liquidity in this market. That doesn't mean it's not happening. I think it's just hard to quantify. I think the repo market you can easily quantify it. You can see the reduction in repo commitment from various banks, including ourselves, and you can see over quarter-end how repo spreads react. By the way, to me that looks like that's an intended desire by the regulators. They wanted people to either reprice or shrink that business. And so I think away from that the reason why this is difficult is because it's a question of really what is the multi-year accumulation of regulation? Things being pushed more electronically, inability to hold as much balance sheet, increasing RWAs, all these things so vocal. But I think these things reveal themselves over many years. But obviously, you can't have as much regulation as we've had and not have some unintended consequences. I think it's just the cost of regulation. Doesn't mean the regulation is not good. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood. And maybe just switching gears for a moment. Just wanted to dig into some your comments that you made on the debt underwriting side. You cited strong DCM really driven by higher leverage finance activity, which is certainly a nice surprise just given some of the regulatory pressures in that area. I wanted to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the outlook for the business more broadly. And one of the questions we hear most often is whether the recent pickup in activity is more tactical driven versus a reflection of what could be sustained strength in that business. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, you're right to ask that question and the question's been coming up for the last couple years, obviously, as we've gone through this part of the cycle with tighter credit spreads and lower rates. And we talked about this. If the M&A cycle remains strong, then obviously that will be a positive tailwind to the underwriting business. And it was for us. When I said leverage finance activity, I could have said leverage finance activity facilitated in part by our advisory business. So if the M&A backdrop continues the way it feels today \u2013 but I think M&A will help. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Steven. Take care. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Devin. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Most have been asked and answered, but just a question on the market volatility. We hear the term healthy volatility versus unhealthy volatility in the market. So can you help us think about what you think could drive that healthy volatility that seem to be missing? It seems like every time we have one of these macro flare-ups, like Greece as an example, we just see more extreme market moves which I think would be put in the unhealthy bucket. So any perspective there would be appreciated. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think in an effort to overly simplify this, I think healthy volatility is volatility in which client activity picks up and liquidity exists, clients feel confident. Unhealthy volatility is the reverse of that where clients get more conservative and they derisk. And so as we go through these periods, the general trend, obviously, feels like volatility is picking up in a healthy way, but that doesn't mean from time to time we're not going to hit these kind of pockets. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. And then just secondly, on debt underwriting again, not to beat a dead horse, but just given the strength there, and speaking to the leverage finance market, do you feel like you're gaining market share there doing transactions that maybe others are moving away from, or does it just feel like you're benefiting with the rising tide as M&A is picking up? Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, no, there's nothing we're doing. We're being pretty conservative in terms of our thought process in terms of the business. And our risk-taking is being very prudent. It really is all about M&A activity. Again, as I mentioned to you, I talked about at the announce (55:42), but when you look at the completed lead tables (55:44), obviously, our team is really in the center of all the M&A dialogs. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Yup. Got it. Thanks, Harvey. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey M. Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I just want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please feel free to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and I look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Take care, everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Dennis, and I\u2019ll be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2015. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For discussion of some of the risk and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2014. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results, and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.9 billion. Net earnings $1.4 billion. Earnings per diluted share $2.90, and our annualized return on common equity was 7%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $26.5 billion. Net earnings $5.3 billion. Earnings per diluted share $10.84, and our return \u2013 our annualized return on common equity was 8.8%. Book value per share is up 5% relative to year-end 2014, despite recording net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters, up $2.1 billion for the year-to-date. These provisions largely from legacy issues reduced our annualized return on common equity for the first nine months of the year by approximately 3 percentage points. Moving to the third quarter, parts of our franchise performed quite well, while others operated against a more challenging backdrop. Our M&A franchise continued to deliver robust results and our outlook remains positive. We continue to see net inflows in our investment management business. Of course, they\u2019re the usual seasonal drivers due to the summer slowdown, but in addition the third quarter also had more than its fair share of significant macroeconomic developments. Both the Chinese economy and the country\u2019s monetary policy came into focus. Our clients evaluated the potential implications of a slowing Chinese economy, the decision by the People\u2019s Bank of China to devalue its currency, and the resulting volatility in global markets. As it relates to the U.S. economy, our clients remain focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy. Over the course of the third quarter, client\u2019s expectations for an interest rate hike began to shift. Mixed economic indicators drove uncertainty about the pace of U.S. economic growth. Ultimately, there was doubt about the timing and magnitude of the future rate increase. Another significant macroeconomic theme in the third quarter, commodities. Prices fell across a number of different products. WTI was down 24%. Copper and natural gas were both down approximately 10%. The price slump let the market to focus on the credit risk of commodity producers, trading houses, and those economies with significant commodity exports. These concerns drove an increase in credit spreads, particularly across the energy sector. The sum impact of these various events led to lower levels of client activity and a significant repricing of the equity and credit markets. The S&P was down nearly 7%, the MSCI world was down almost 10%, and the Shanghai Composite was down close to 30%. In the credit markets, European high yield spreads were 107 basis points wider and U.S. high yield spreads were 153 basis points wider. Not surprisingly, we produced lower quarterly revenues across many of our businesses, given both declining asset prices and reduced level of client activity. Now, I will discuss each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.6 billion, 23% lower than a strong second quarter as underwriting slowed. Although issuance declined during the quarter, our Investment Banking backlog remains strong and was up compared to both the second quarter and the end of 2014. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $809 million, roughly consistent with the second quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. During this period, we served as an advisor on nearly $900 billion of completed transactions. This is roughly $350 billion more than our next closest competitor. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including DirecTV\u2019s $67.1 billion sale to AT&T, eBay\u2019s $46.8 billion spin-off of PayPal, and Baxter\u2019s $20.3 billion spin-off of Baxalta. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter. These include Energy Transfer Equity\u2019s $37.7 billion acquisition of the Williams Companies, Humana\u2019s $37 billion sale to Aetna, and Procter & Gamble\u2019s $12.5 billion merger of its beauty business into Coty. Moving to underwriting, revenues were $747 million in the third quarter, down 38% sequentially, primarily due to a significant decline in equity issuance. Although global activity was weaker, our franchise remains strong with a number one ranking in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for the year-to-date. Equity underwriting revenues were $190 million. This was down substantially compared to the second quarter, due to a decrease of industry wide IPOs and secondary offerings, as higher volatility and a decline in prices reduced activity. Debt underwriting revenues of $557 million were down 8% quarter-over-quarter, a decrease of industry wide issuance volumes was partially offset by acquisition related financing. During the third quarter, we actively supported our client\u2019s financing needs leading HP Enterprises $14.6 billion debt offering related to a spin-off from HP, Biogen\u2019s $6 billion debt offering, and Simporno\u2019s [ph] $1.4 billion rights offering. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses. Net revenues were $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down a 11% compared to the second quarter. Within the number of our businesses, the macro concerns I have already talked about impacted both client conviction and activity. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter and included a $147 million of DVA gains. Net revenues were down 9% from the second quarter and market-making conditions continue to be challenging. Currencies improved sequentially, as the devaluation in the Chinese yuan sparked significant client activity within our emerging market franchise. Commodities increased relative to a more challenging second quarter, as declining commodity prices and higher volatility benefited results. Interest rates was significantly lower, as uncertainty related to the direction of U.S. interest rates impacted activity. Credit decreased, as client activity remains generally low amid continued spread widening. Mortgages was significantly lower as conditions remained challenged with limited client activity. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 12% quarter-over-quarter and included $35 million in DVA gains. Equities\u2019 client execution net revenues decreased 29% sequentially to $555 million. Broadly speaking, client activity declined versus the second quarter, as higher volatility and global equity market weakness impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. However, as is often the case in more volatile markets, we did see activity pickup in our lower touch electronic channels, as a result commissions and fees were up 7% quarter-over-quarter to $818 million. Security services generated net revenues of $379 million, down 14%, compared to the seasonally stronger second quarter. Turning to risk, despite an increase in volatility, average daily bar in the third quarter was down $3 million sequentially to $74 million. Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $670 million in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $370 million. The declining global equity markets negatively impacted net revenues and public equities during the quarter. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $300 million with the majority coming from net interest income. The Investment Management reported third quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, down 14%, excuse me, 14% from the second quarter, as incentive fees declined. Management and other fees were down 3% sequentially to $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision reached a record $1.19 trillion, as long-term net inflows more than offset market depreciation. With respect to long-term flows, organic net inflows were strong at $23 billion. We also closed the Pacific Global Advisors acquisition during the quarter, which added $18 billion of assets. This represents our 7th acquisition since the beginning of 2012. Over that timeframe, total long-term net inflows were $195 billion. $71 billion of these net flows came from acquisitions. Moving to performance across the global platform, 72% of our client mutual fund assets were in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a three-year basis, and 70% in funds ranked in the top two quartiles on a five-year basis. Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40% for the year-to-date. This is 200 basis points lower than the firm\u2019s accrual in the first-half of this year and consistent with the year-to-date compensation ratio at the end of the third quarter of 2014. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were 30% lower than the second quarter. Substantially all the decrease was driven by a larger litigation charge taken in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net provisions for litigation and regulatory expenses were $416 million. Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff increased by 2,000 to approximately 36,900, which was up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Roughly half of the new staff was from the federation, largely technology and operations. The other half was primarily spread across Investment Banking and Investment Management. The increase was dominated by campus hires and reflects both the activity levels in certain businesses and our continued investment in regulatory compliance. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 31%. Our global core liquid assets averaged $193 billion during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% using the Standardized approach, it was 12.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%. And finally, we repurchased 5.4 million shares of common stock for $1.1 billion in the third quarter. As we have discussed related to our share repurchase capacity, any potential share repurchases over the next three quarters will be more back-end weighted compared to the last two quarters. Before we turn to Q&A, I\u2019ll share some thoughts around the market and industry broadly. The third quarter served as a reminder of the fragility and sensitivity of markets, investor sentiment, and the path to strong global economic growth. As you know over the last several years, the financial services industry has faced a series of headwinds. These pressures have forced many within the industry to rethink their footprint or their level of commitment to a variety of businesses, particularly within the more capital intensive businesses of fixed income, currencies, and commodities. At Goldman Sachs, our strategy remains intact to be the leading advisor, underwriter, liquidity provider, financier, and investment manager. To that end, we are always looking for ways to deliver more differentiated value to our clients. We\u2019re also keenly aware of the challenges facing the industry. While some of our businesses are experiencing year-to-date growth, for example, Investment Banking and Investment Management, other parts of the business are in a more difficult part of the cycle. However, we\u2019re hardly complacence. For example, within FICC, we are proactively responded to industry wide challenges, including asset sales, expense initiatives, and balance sheet reduction. The goal of these various efforts is to maintain margins, improve returns, prudently manage risk, and protect the global client franchise. We will always look for additional opportunities to improve our FICC operations. However, we will also never lose sight of the tremendous value that we can bring to our FICC clients over the long term. In closing, we believe that our long-term prospects are quite favorable. Our global pipe franchise, it\u2019s as strong as ever. Our lead table rankings and track record of superior returns are a byproduct of that strength. In addition, we have the people, the risk culture, the embedded operating leverage and clarity of purpose to deliver superior value to you, our shareholders, particularly as the environment improves. Thank you, again, for dialing in. And I\u2019m happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. Harvey, Harvey, maybe we pick up where you left off on the whole cyclical versus structural debate in FICC. And I heard everything you said and I think you\u2019re right, and I think you are who you say you\u2019re for your clients. But I look at the backdrop and I say, the Europeans are actually starting to need to adjust their balance sheets and shrink parts of the business. And so the thought of Goldman maintaining is optionality all these years. This would seem like the pay off and yet a pick up in volatility in several asset classes, it feels like actually the world that was coming your way, but yet the revenue reduction for Goldman relative to peers, and I\u2019m not just talking this quarter, last couple of quarters is more pronounced. I\u2019m just trying to do the smell test of all, why is that, because I actually do think that things are lining up that you would be more important to your clients, not less and there would be more opportunities, not less. Harvey Schwartz : So, well, first of all, completely agree with that thesis, maybe let\u2019s back up a little bit. And I think it\u2019s worth having a discussion, because I think the easy way to the have it is sort of break it down into three parts. Let\u2019s just talk about the quarter for a minute. Obviously, it\u2019s a tough quarter for us in fixed income. But if you think about how we\u2019re running the business, I think that\u2019s the more important two parts. If you look back over the last several years at the expense initiatives we\u2019ve taken where we have reduced headcount fixed income by more than 10%. We have shrunk the balance sheet by 20%, and if you actually look at it on RWA basis since we switched over to Basel III, we really very softly [ph] managed the capital deployment. So in this part of the cycle, we have been very disciplined about how we managed those resources. Now, of course, your thesis is our thesis, which is we\u2019re in a deep and somewhat long cyclical part of the fixed cycle. But when you think of the forward, our construction simplified is twofold. Our level engagement with our clients tells us clients still need the services. It\u2019s like M&A, Glenn. M&A, the services weren\u2019t active in 2009 and 2010, people questioned whether or not M&A would come back. But our dialogue told us that client engagement and the services we provided to the liquidity provider were important. So when we think about the forward and we hear the announcements and we\u2019re in this part of the cycle, but it\u2019s going to take a while for that to transition through, because I think so far it\u2019s been more than announcements than a retrenchment, and you won\u2019t really see it happen in all the steps we\u2019ve taken until you see a pick up in client activity and the competitive environment continue to shift, that may take a while. But in the meantime, look, we\u2019ll benefit as a firm, because we would diversify until you saw a pick up in certain part of equities, you\u2019ve seen the strength in banking. But certainly a tougher quarter for us in fixed income this quarter. Glenn Schorr : May just a last follow-up on the FICC conversation is, how if any, does the new vocal reporting requirements changed? How you managed the business? How you reported? I\u2019m just curious, because we can\u2019t see any of them? Harvey Schwartz : No chance that we managed the business. Any steps in terms of vocal adoption happened a number of years ago, where we shutdown certain business. And all of the U.S. firms are subject to the same rule set in vocal, so not an issue. I really think it\u2019s a question of client environment. In the third quarter, the environment for all the factors I mentioned was very challenging, it was hard for us. And if we go back to the first quarter the first quarter environment was one with more activity and better performance on our part, but we don\u2019t want to overreact to a particular quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Michael. Michael Carrier : Hi. Just first, you mentioned some of your comments on the commodity, I guess pressures in the quarter. Just wanted to get kind of an update. When you guys look at commodities and that everyone call it asset class. Just how do you view your exposure to that part of the market or the economy? And then, when you look at it from a client base, what has been happening, meaning our \u2013 the clients in those areas lot \u2013 less active, more active, and are you seeing that spread to any other areas of the economy? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of the exposure, we\u2019re not a big lender to the energy space. I think the best way to characterize it for you is just to take a look at two parts of that. First, any of our funded exposure to non-investment grade parts of the sector, it\u2019s a bit over $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. And the other sector, which obviously came to focus in the quarter is the trading houses. And we\u2019re less than $200 million in exposure to those trading houses. So they\u2019re not, as I said, we\u2019re not a big lender, not an important part of our business. In terms of the aggregate impact, in terms of client activity, things have been moving so quickly that sometimes as advantageous to client activity and intensity when things are more trending. I think the whole world is adjusting to basically a longer-term consideration of commodity prices being lower in the intermediate term. And ultimately, that will be a catalyst for activity, as clients considered hedging strategies, as they think about financing alternatives, as clients and companies struggle for refinancing. So lower for longer in commodity prices, while very good for the consumer and the global consumer and the broader economy, which is also a tailwind, certainly, it should be a catalyst for client activity also. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, maybe on capital and the ratios, if you have the CET1, maybe like the fully phased immerse of the transitional, and then just given the decent buffers, just any outlook in terms of where you think you would run that? In the buyback pace, just seemed like it ramped up. I know you guys have been saying, it\u2019s backward weighted, but it just seemed like this quarter was probably a bit sooner than expected. So just wanted to understand, is that because of the movement in the stock or is it just the plan with the CCAR process being pretty normal from what you guys expected? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So on the capital ratio, so with the G-SIB buffer finalized that what you said 10%, and obviously we have a lot of capacity above that. Our target zone would be 50 to 100 basis points above that. If you\u2019re just looking at that set of metrics and obviously our supplementary leverage ratios in very good shape at 58, but CCARs are binding constraints. And so, at least, it has been. In terms of the share repurchase capacity and what we\u2019ll do, obviously as you know, we don\u2019t disclose that, we don\u2019t disclose it for the very simple fact that we don\u2019t want our shareholders to think of share repurchase as dividends. And we also reserve and really look forward to actually deploying the capital back into the business. Now, in terms of the mechanics of what is possible part of the profile that you saw over the last two quarters certainly dictated by the specifics of the test. But to an extent, which we use the capacity over the next three quarters, as I said in my early remarks, you should expect it to be more back-end weighted than you\u2019ve seen in the prior two. Does that helpful? Michael Carrier : Okay. And \u2013 yes. And then just to see if you want, if you had the fully phased in, and I think you guys gave the transitional? Harvey Schwartz : So on Standardized or are you talking Advanced? Michael Carrier : I think if you have both, but Advanced probably more\u2026 Harvey Schwartz : [indiscernible] began. So on a transitional advanced 12.7%, fully phased in 11.9%, on Standardized 12.4%, and fully phased 11.7%. So as I said a lot of capacity over our 10% minimum and our operating range of 10.5% to a 11%. Michael Carrier : Got it. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : .: Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Chris, good morning. Operator : Mr. Christian, check your phone to see if your line is on mute, sir? Christian Bolu : Hello, good morning. Can you hear me now? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, sure. Christian Bolu : Yes, sorry by that. I will ask the FICC question of another way, as it\u2019s a focus of investor this morning. I guess, three of the last four quarters, performances lagged peers. How do you rationalize this? Is it a business mix or customer mix issue? And then looking forward just a bear market backdrop, or is there any proactive steps you can take to improve performance? Harvey Schwartz : Well, there\u2019s always things we can do better, we\u2019re not perfect. So we always look at them. Christian, we don\u2019t see as much value in comparing revenues certainly revenues quarter-to-quarter movements, but we certainly study them and we look for any valuable insights. But I think if you really look to the quarter-to-quarter noise, you run the risk of over steering the business. So, for example, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t glean huge value out of that in terms of comparing competitors, I don\u2019t know how much value we\u2019ll get out of this quarter. So we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into their businesses. Our focus has to be on a hand of things, most importantly, our client engagements, and then our profit margins, the risk management, and the ultimate returns. And so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ll focus on. In fact, now it\u2019s interesting, because you brought up the issue of volatility of revenues, and I make a couple of important points. If you look over the years, revenues don\u2019t really tell a great story. And as a shareholder, if you want a collection of businesses, and if you actually look at our performance, consistency of ROE, and returns and earnings, we\u2019re the most stable. And so it really is about from wide earnings, not revenues. Anyway I don\u2019t know if that helps you or not. Christian Bolu : Yes, no, that helps, and thanks for the clarifications. Maybe just a broader question on pricing power in the business. I guess, what lessons have you learned from the price increases implemented in the prime brokerage business from what we can see revenue generation has not suffered at all for any of the top players. Maybe does that tell you that the industry has more leverage in pricing, and maybe can we expect this and other business to maybe offset some of the weaker activity trends? Harvey Schwartz : So I think there\u2019s two things driving. Your first is a question of really strength of franchise. And we\u2019ve had a long, long history of being a dominant player in the prime brokerage business, and I think it really is the value proposition that we offer our clients globally, that is the differential in that business. I think the capital rules, as they come into play and the balance sheet impact of those capital rules in the class has forced a very natural repricing in terms of how much balance sheet we and the industry can provide the clients. And clients are being very judicious about that, but they\u2019re also been making a differentiated judgment about who the best value providers are, and we\u2019re certainly one of those. And so we\u2019re seeing pricing power. Christian Bolu : And any other businesses you think you can accept that pricing power? Harvey Schwartz : So, certainly in as we talked about in the past from time-to-time when activity has picked up, I don\u2019t know necessarily, I would call it pricing power as much as I would call it an absence of competition. But certainly in the commodity space several quarters ago, there was a lot of activity where certainly competition, which if you want to call that pricing power, I think of it a little bit differently. But certainly clients were going to engage us differently. And then in the derivative businesses globally, as you\u2019re seeing firms exit parts of the CDS business and other parts of the equity derivative businesses, I think it\u2019s early days, but certainly you\u2019re seeing a reduction in competition, and that translates into pricing power or maybe better said better returns. Christian Bolu : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Christian. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Actually first is the quick follow-up to that very last comment you made about some repricing in parts of equity derivatives. I just I haven\u2019t heard that before. Maybe I haven\u2019t been paying attention. But what areas there? Harvey Schwartz : So it\u2019s really two parts we\u2019ve seen some of it in Europe where competition used to be sort of more significant, but also given the requirements around collateral worlds and things like that where you may have at times had marginal participants actually pricing that levels where we would have thought the risk return didn\u2019t make sense. Now you\u2019re seeing more rational and improved pricing I\u2019d say that\u2019s a general trend. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just separately, can you give us an update on the bank deposit and lending strategy. You obviously announced a deal to acquire some deposits and have had a key hire in the lending side I think in the second quarter. So just give us an update on what you are thinking there and will we see this business grow to be meaningful at some point? Harvey Schwartz : Sure, great question. And the way the first thing I will emphasize on that question is really the separation between a liability strategy, and potential asset strategy. So these two things are completely separate, but I think it\u2019s natural that people would link them. The online deposit strategy, where we requested approval for the deposit platform that really is all about funding diversification we have spent sometime contemplating building our own platform this platform became available, it seemed attractive and timely for us and for GE. And so, but we would do that independently of any asset driven strategy. Now, in terms of the digitally led lending strategy, which you talked about is not a lot to update you on since we last talked. We\u2019re thrilled to have Harvey on board as our partner, he brings a wealth of knowledge and we feel like there is a handful of reasons why we maybe able to have an impact on this space here. One our real core competencies, and risk management, and technology. And we feel like we maybe able to provide a differentiated product that is accretive to the firms current returns, but it\u2019s going to be slow going obviously, we built lots of business at Goldman Sachs this is a new business. Again it\u2019s great to have Harvey here, because he brings all the expertise\u2019s and when we have more to talk you about we\u2019ll certainly update you, but it\u2019s going to be very deliberate in terms of its development. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I guess just a quick follow-up, on the funding side, as we think about the deposits growing over time, is that something that will benefit you in down turns or is it also something that will benefit the earnings incrementally from lower funding costs? Harvey Schwartz : I think it\u2019s too twofold I mean, we have always been very conservative about our liquidity profile and a part of being conservative is about being diversified and so we\u2019re always looking for diversification I\u2019m always looking for cost-effectiveness. But when we think about liability management, again it it\u2019s really about making sure we have the strongest financial footings at any given point of time. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Betsy, how are you? Betsy Graseck : Good. So, just a question about how you think about your market share. As you indicated, revenues were tough way to measure things, because people have different positions and marks, et cetera. So, I\u2019m interested in understanding how you think about how you are doing on market share, really from a transaction side. I know you talk about client engagement. So thinking that from a transaction perspective ignoring the P&L impact where do you think you stand in your various businesses? Harvey Schwartz : So, I know you\u2019re asking me question narrowly, but in terms of running those businesses and particularly FICC, it really is multipart. So our client engagements in the businesses that we\u2019re focused on feels quite good. So for example we\u2019re not the biggest emerging markets firm as you know, because we don\u2019t have offices in hundred countries and it\u2019s never been the biggest part of our footprint there are certainly always things that we\u2019re focused on and if you think about our client base, we\u2019re more skewed I think, because we\u2019re not the biggest lender in the globe, we\u2019re more skewed to professional money managers and investors and you saw and you could see their activity moves around. But we feel good about our client engagements and our market shares, but it\u2019s a multi-part question is \u2013 it\u2019s not just about clients although they\u2019re the most important part and running these businesses, it really is about margins returns over the long-term. Betsy Graseck : Okay then separately on the INL space last quarter you gave a very helpful dissection of a third, a third, a third in terms of revenue flows that were a function of public marks versus not so public versus private. Do you have any kind of breakdown on how the quarter was impacted by that? Harvey Schwartz : Sure, so let\u2019s just maybe step back. So at the end of the second quarter the INL balance sheet was $89 billion and roughly 75% of that is debt related. So the balance really equity related and then it breaks out. But the breakout I gave you last time really was public equities, which were down and they [part 11 1 : 41]more or less in line with global markets and they started $4 billion at the quarter and so certainly there was just the path to mark-to-market. And then in private equity the vast majority of the performance that offset the public portfolio was event related and by event related I mean sales, pending sales IPOs. And we really benefited from the idiosyncratic nature of the portfolio. We\u2019re not large for example in some of the hardest hit sectors like energy and that kind of stuff. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks, very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from a line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Glenn Schorr : Hi Mike. Mike Mayo : Questions on trading both equities, and fixed income. What percent is electronic or automated and has that compared to five years ago. And then the second question is, kind of what percent of the business would you say pricing is more rational than it\u2019s been in the past? Harvey Schwartz : So, on the second part I\u2019d say it\u2019s the trend is improving in terms of rational pricing, but it\u2019s in a market where the client engagement from quarter-to-quarter has been very different right, so we saw it in the first quarter, we saw less in second quarter I think that I would answer the electronic trading question as sort of long-term. The secular trend, which has been in place long before the crisis, that just continues and to some extent is aided by the creation of SEPs and things. This quarter what we\u2019ve seen in the past, what we saw in this quarter where when volatility is quite severe particularly in the equity markets. Clients really look to de-risk or add risk and they tend to trade electronically, so I would say it\u2019s a trend, but I don\u2019t have the specific numbers for you Mike, in terms of the quarter contribution of electronic versus cash, but we can certainly get to that stuff. Mike Mayo : I think, can you just give even a ballpark. If electronic 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% just any sort of ballpark figure? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I don\u2019t want to guess on a ballpark, certainly in the third quarter there was a meaningful pick up in electronic activity relative to cash in the equities business and again I don\u2019t want to guess at a number for you Mike, we\u2019ll be happy to get you one. Mike Mayo : Sure, and then just a follow-up on the pricing. What areas in particular are you seeing the best pricing improvement in trading? Harvey Schwartz : So, I\u2019d say balance sheet intensive business is broadly and that really is as firms globally around the world adjust capital requirements and have to be more thoughtful about the marginal deployment of balance sheet. And then other things, that are potentially balance sheet consumers like longer dated derivatives swaps and certainly when commodities has picked up, we have seen circumstances where and this is obviously augmented by the fact that their trading houses have gone through some pretty significant pressure now. What we\u2019re saying reduce competition, but again it\u2019s harder to see it certainly translate through unless the client activity levels are high. I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this big back and forth swing between a quarter like the first quarter where we had a 14.7% ROE and in this quarter we have a much tougher quarter. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Guy Moszkowski : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit first on the composition of the change in revenues in equities and FICC from the second to the third quarter in FICC you alluded I think to rates first off as having contributed significantly, and then you mentioned credit and mortgages, was that kind of the ordering of the degree to, which they impacted the revenue move? Harvey Schwartz : Mortgages, was a bigger driver if you\u2019re doing year-over-year comparables. Guy Moszkowski : Right. But I mean for the second quarter to third quarter shift? Harvey Schwartz : Mortgages remain challenged. The biggest driver was interest rates and then followed by mortgages. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. So the widening of credit spreads that was actually pretty significant in the quarter didn\u2019t really \u2013 it wasn\u2019t as impactful overall on FICC as just what was going on in rates and mortgages? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, we saw it more in those two businesses, but it was still challenging obviously for credit markets. Guy Moszkowski : And then really to the same question for equity, you\u2019ve talked in the release on a year-over-year basis about cash versus derivatives. But can you talk about, as you move from second to third quarter, what was driving the change in client execution? Harvey Schwartz : So, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Obviously, lots of volatility in Asia, which had an impact on the entire market structure in terms of global market responded. But basically there instead of the shift I talked about earlier, tougher market conditions in Asia and then a shift to electronic activity, which boosted commissions and fees. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. And then just final question, which I think is going to relate to I&L, in the release you alluded to a pretty hefty decline in level III assets linked quarter about 15%. Is that largely driven by I&L, and if so, can you give us a sense for how much of the reduction is due to actual runoff for planned portfolio sales versus just the impact of negative marks? Harvey Schwartz : A pretty meaningful driver was actually monetizations and harvesting that was really the driver. Guy Moszkowski : So, actually underlying the negative mark-to-market on the public portfolio. It really does sound like there was very significant positive activity in terms of just being able to reduce positions? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of reduced positions, you mean, in terms of harvesting\u2026 Guy Moszkowski : Yes, monetization let\u2019s put it that way? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, the portfolio did well. As I said, the vast majority of the driver of the performance in the portfolio came from event driven things like IPOs, asset sales. Obviously, the public portfolio suffered with public markets. Guy Moszkowski : And in terms of \u2013 just a follow-up on exactly that comment, would it be as straightforward as to saying the public portfolio was $4 billion in equities, the MSCI as you\u2019ve alluded to was down about 10% that the mark there would be about that, or is it more complex to that? Harvey Schwartz : It can be different from quarter-to-quarter, but I would say that\u2019s pretty reasonable. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Thanks, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, Fiona. Fiona Swaffield : Just \u2013 hi. Just few things. One is the difference between the CT1 ratios and obviously the difference in Advanced and Standardized has gone down quite a lot. And it seems to be something to do, I just wondered, is it the operational risk RWA, I don\u2019t know if you could talk through the differences in those numbers? And the second is just a geographic question. I mean, you\u2019ve alluded to Asia a few times, but could you kind of give us a feel for year-on-year geographic revenues, or kind of trends EMEA versus Asia, were those any big change versus on Q2? Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So in terms of the ratios in Advanced and there was a pick up in operational, which impacted and there was a pickup in operational, which impacted the operational, but the real driver in the improvement of the ratios was on harvesting, in general risk reduction and you\u2019re seeing it more in standardized, because obviously there are things that are not eccentric, which impact that more like things like clearing and other things and notional and so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the compression. In terms of geography, it has been pretty much 55% in the U.S. and then the balance is really two-thirds EMEA and one-third Asia. Fiona Swaffield : Like what time period would that be is that Q3? Harvey Schwartz : No that\u2019s this quarter. Fiona Swaffield : Great. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning. James Mitchell : Just a question on the M&A outlook. I think there\u2019s been some concern with the disruptions in the market in U.S. hitting the record level that the M&A cycle might be peaking. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. It seems like number of deals haven\u2019t really moved. International volume still remained very well. So I just maybe some thoughts on how you guys think about where we are in the M&A cycle given some of the concerns out there? Harvey Schwartz : So, the two factors that, obviously we rely on most is the backlog, and the pipeline is good. And as I said it was up at the end of the third quarter and then really the most significant information component for us is the level of dialogue that board\u2019s CEOs are having and the dialogue feels quite good. I think it\u2019s always natural for folks to question when the market has been robust, whether there is information content in the actual activity level as peaking and maybe that\u2019s a factor. But when you look at past cycles they\u2019ve been more significantly driven by LBO activity where certainly you can get some market capacity and how much debt can be borrowed and it\u2019s a 100% accurate to note that certainly the cost of financing is a contributor to the transactions that are happening today, but they\u2019re much more strategic and a reflection of slower global growth and how confident CEOs are at this stage. And that could always get disrupted, you can have a market event, but I don\u2019t know necessarily that the aggregate activity levels to-date are the best indicators that they would slow down. If anything, some of these large transactions very naturally have spin-offs and foster other activity across industries. That wouldn\u2019t be the most significant factor we\u2019d look at. James Mitchell : So, you would kind of think is the large deals as this maybe potentially a leading indicator, because a lot of these smaller deals and the number of deals have been lagging. Harvey Schwartz : That\u2019s correct, but so if you get large deals in a sector, it can have a knock on effect and you get spin-offs that can be a leading activity for more activity, but I think in short our indicators tell us that if the current environment continues the level of activity will be high. Again that could always change, a lot of things in the world can shift. James Mitchell : Sure. Okay and maybe just a follow-up on the balance sheet. I think if I look at your disclosures you guys balance sheet was up to a level we haven\u2019t seen in a I think over a year I think balance sheet was up 20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter yet it was a volatile environment, it just looked like you pulled back on risk at least in the bar, can you kind of just help me think through that, you didn\u2019t close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter \u2013 third quarter? Harvey Schwartz : No, that\u2019s subject to regulatory approval. James Mitchell : Great. Harvey Schwartz : No, the balance sheet growth, when you cut through it is really all driven by prime brokers\u2019 activity and so is all client driven in terms of client assets that came in during the course of the quarter. James Mitchell : Just sort of interesting, putting on leverage or? Harvey Schwartz : No actually, you get somebody to fix when people de-lever, actually you can get cash that comes in and actually comes into the balance sheet so client assets can grow partial driver. James Mitchell : Okay. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : No problem. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christoph Kotowski : Yes, hi your comp ratio on a full-year basis have been trending down ever so slightly last couple of years and you were able to keep the year-to-date comp ratio flat at 40% with revenues being down a percent. Going into the fourth quarter how should we think about the full-year comp ratio in terms of that there\u2019d be upward pressure on it if the full-year revenues miss a bit more from here or continued downward pressure the fourth quarter ends up being better and driving you above where you were last year? Harvey Schwartz : So, no change to the compensation philosophy the 40% at this point a year is our best estimate. And we\u2019ll have to see I can\u2019t predict the outcome for you in terms of where the Roland obviously we\u2019ve spent in number of years really building in pretty significant operating leverage, but we\u2019ll have to see how the year plays out, but we\u2019ll go through our normal bottoms up top down process. Christoph Kotowski : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : The you made a point in the press release about the IB backlog building and just was kind of curious whether or not in your view that\u2019s a function improving business outlook or just deals getting held up due to market volatility in some of the trends that we saw impact the FB underwriting line? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so all parts of the backlog were up. The biggest part of the backlog, that was up with equity underwriting. And part of that is the markets being more challenges, and challenge in part of the season, but I think that the more important takeaway is less about market influence over the quarter and more about activity levels client confidence, which certainly at times for CEOs would have been tested as we came during the quarter. But the transactions that they\u2019re contemplating are very long-term and strategic. And so I think it speaks more to corporate confidence than anything else. Brennan Hawken : Okay, but thanks for that color. And then thinking about that point and then connecting it to I&L and the commentary around monetization events and such. Can you help us understand how, when, the exit strategy or ability to use the IPOs or equity markets is weaker how you guys were able to have an up-tick in monetization and episodic events in I&L I was just trying to connect those two dots please. Harvey Schwartz : So, again it\u2019s just it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio, it won\u2019t always necessarily be this way in the quarter, but there will be opportunities for us to sell assets and in taking company\u2019s public and those kind of things those were usually on a schedule, it usually don\u2019t happen instantaneously they can certainly get delayed by market activity. But I can\u2019t answer the question any better for you than it\u2019s the nature of the portfolio. Brennan Hawken : Okay and I mean did you rely on M&A in addition to IPO, it sounds like you were purely relying going on the IPOs market right? Harvey Schwartz : There\u2019s IPOs, private sale they can come in a number of different forms, so there\u2019s certainly transaction that you wouldn\u2019t see the public eye parts of the portfolio are in real estate not really heavy and financials or anything like that not heavy in energy. So that gives you some of the background why maybe the portfolio on it\u2019s surface would have performed better than you might have expected. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks for the color Harvey. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Steven. Steven Chubak : Harvey, I appreciated all your comments on the quarter FICC strategy how are you still committed to business at the same time aren\u2019t going to be complacent. And just looking at some of the capital metrics, it feels as though the RWAs have been slight to maybe honest slightly downward trajectory, but we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in terms capital and risk allocations. And just want to get a sense as to and trying and obviously making a concerted effort not to simply be complacent whether you\u2019re going to look to shrink risk on and any meaningful way within that business if the pressures persists on the revenue side? Harvey Schwartz : So, the risk reduction again well level said it since we want obviously the risk reduction is pretty significant right RWAs were down a third across ICS, which is vastly, which is mostly FICC and so I think the risk reduction effort, the balance sheet reduction, the cost reduction exercises have been pretty significant. So I don\u2019t think we can be accused of being complacent around the cycle again this is about finding that right balance. If the cycle continues and it stops we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business that is an ongoing process that never stops. If the cycle picks up then, we will obviously participate and that we can feel good about the competitive environment and our client engagement. Now away from fixed, obviously, we\u2019re doing lots of other things. So, I talked about the fact that we made a number of acquisitions in asset management and that fee-based business continues to grow and be a bigger part of the firm. Obviously, full engagement in IBD and or the merger activity and their performance I think has been stellar. So there\u2019s a lot going on under the hood in terms of reallocating resources. But we are being very disciplined about the fixed business during this part of the cycle, as you would expect us to be. Steven Chubak : Okay, thanks for that, Harvey. And it\u2019s a fair point on the RWA, as I was talking more in the near-term context over the last few quarters. But certainly, since we\u2019ve been monitoring all the Basel III measures, you made a pretty substantial progress? Harvey Schwartz : That I also think, look, I think if you look at our capital management and the capital we\u2019ve been able to return over the last several years, we\u2019ve been as judicious as we can given the capital rules, and managing the firm in a way to make sure that the financial footings are perfectly solid. Steven Chubak : Okay. And then as you mentioned the capital rules, there is one quick follow-up. Did you say buffers have all been published by the Fed, it looks like you guys fell into the 3% bucket. I just wanted to get a sense as to whether you see any opportunities to optimize or shrink into that lower buffer 2.5 or given that CCARs are binding constraint, at least, for the moment as maybe not such a pressing need to do that? Harvey Schwartz : So, well, I think the big picture, the first thing we\u2019ll do obviously is in any opportunity that we think we can reduce our systemic footprint now that the rule is finalized. Obviously, we would look to do that. I think that\u2019s just good practice. I think the trade-off obviously is whether or not in making those reductions, does that really impact your ability to deliver to clients. Now the rules are finalized. There are certainly things we can do. As you said, we\u2019re not bound currently by our state of capital ratios, CCARs are are constrained, we\u2019ll have to see how CCAR evolves over time, that certainly could be an influence, because it could ultimately reprice the cost of that capital relative to the services we provide. But I think it\u2019s a bit early for that, at least, for us. Steven Chubak : All right. Thanks for taking my questions, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the I&L discussion. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about sort of the quarter-to-quarter risk management practices within that unit, given how market volatility can have such a profound effect on revenue recognition in any given period? Harvey Schwartz : Well, again, I think, one of the \u2013 I think one of the things to point out is, if you think about the transformation of the I&L balance sheet over the last several years, it has changed pretty significantly. The composition today, as I said earlier is really 75% debt. And roughly two-thirds of that is HFI accounting, which is just good old-fashioned bank accounting. The balance is equities and if you compare that to, for example, go back to 2011, in 2011, I think the whole portfolio was more than 50% equities. And so the composition of the portfolio has changed significantly. Now, if you\u2019re going to have $4 billion public equity portfolio, which is the result of us monetizing asset out of the portfolio and we\u2019re in a sell-down process, if the markets move around a lot that\u2019s going to move around a lot. And ultimately, if the markets decline for extended periods of time or increase for extended periods, obviously that drives value of underlying assets and it drives activity for all businesses in all industries. But the portfolio composition has changed pretty dramatically over the last several years. And when you talk about the volatility, I can\u2019t help to remind you that over long periods of time, I&L has been a pretty big driver of book value. Eric Wasserstrom : No, certainly, I mean, I guess, my \u2013 I\u2019m trying to make sure I sort of fully understand, given that so much of the, at least, equity opportunity does come from seed investments sort of then hit their liquidation strategy, sort of how that shifts the risk management discussion when you move from no liquid to an \u2013 to a liquid asset, whose risk parameters are somewhat different? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So we obviously consider that I think the most important risk component in the discussion is about the point of actually establishing the investments and that\u2019s a long-term process of being disciplined that has to be the philosophy, so look if we see a number of quarters of back to back declining in market that may be the right time to actually being to put capital to work which is why we run with excess capital and we run with excess liquidity because we want to be there for those opportunities and we want to be there for our client. So we size the risk of the investment at the point of making it. Once you have it you can certainly do things but prudent risk management really is the point of the initial decision. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it and that makes a lot of sense and if I can just sneak in one quick follow up on the RWA discussion within the trading businesses. Was there any real change in RWA over the course of the quarter? Harvey Schwartz : There were I mean in advance, we finished the quarter at 570 that was down a little bit. In standardized we finished at 582 which you would expect to be down given the move I gave you in the ratios earlier. Eric Wasserstrom : And presumably most out of FICC or someone else? Harvey Schwartz : Sorry, what was that? Eric Wasserstrom : And I was just saying was that mostly because of changes in FICC composition or something else? Harvey Schwartz : The big mover was really in markets which in advanced went from 13.6% to kind of 11.9% and Standardized went from 13.7% down to 12.0% and that really is about derisking. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marlin Lacey Mosby IV : Thanks. Good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Marty. Marlin Lacey Mosby IV : I wanted to give you a chance to stop the drum beat that we have had on levelling out the comp ratio through the year when you mentioned earlier that some consistency of returns for the whole company and not the volatility of revenues. So, just wanted to see whether or not you think coincidentally, the way that this line is up as you go through the calendar year, revenues are typically stronger in the first half, and you get the comp ratio benefit in the second half and somehow coincidentally that kind of hedges each other. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that? Harvey Schwartz : So we don\u2019t do it that way as other way that we think about it. There\u2019s some seasonality to the business which historically has been the case for the entire industry. As it relates to the compensation ratio from quarter-to-quarter, we just make our best estimates of where we think the performance of the firm is and what the compensation ratio should be. In the fourth quarter we will go through our normal process which again will be firm performance rather than to the businesses and to the individuals and it would top down to bottoms up and we will just have to see where things turn out for the fourth quarter. Marlin Lacey Mosby IV : So that\u2019s why I was mentioning coincidentally. I know you don\u2019t tie them together like that but it kind of works out in the favour of, kind of stabilizing as you go through the year. The second thing I was going to ask you was you mentioned the acquisitions in the asset managers and what we used to do is look at certain businesses where you could really leverage your economic capital while not really impacting your regulatory capital and I thought this is probably a business that might fit into that category and just thought is that kind of how you look at it and also there are other businesses you might be able to take advantage of that in? Harvey Schwartz : So we\u2019re always looking really at the quarter. We are always looking at ways where we can enhance the client experience and so you know all these acquisitions which I mentioned, they really break down to three large buckets, secular growth opportunities like advisory and in that it was referenced in the \u2013 as I said in the Pacific Global Advisors\u2019 acquisition, and those things like new product capabilities where we certainly develop new products internally, but there are times both in demand is better for us and that\u2019s an example, that would be Westpeak and ActiveBeta and then there are times when we just want to scale existing products like money markets and you have seen us do acquisitions in that space. It really is all about \u2013 thing about how we can differentiate with our clients. Now from a regulatory capital perspective, we don\u2019t necessarily think about that as much as we think about what is the best way to deploy our capital. Obviously we have to manage our regulatory capital but this is a result of regulatory requirements or anything like that. We will always look at acquisitions or ways to grow or deploy our capital that are long-term accretive for the firm. We want to just to grow obviously those that consume more regulatory capital and those that consume less. Marlin Lacey Mosby IV : And those that will have a little less or little more efficient and use of the capital that you have, but thanks and I appreciate your comments. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. So I just had a quick question on the deposits strategy. You mentioned that was all about the funding diversification. So if you look at the second quarter deposits were about 12% of total liabilities. What percentage that you need to get to for you to consider that to be you\u2019ve to meet your diversification levels as you want? Harvey Schwartz : So it\u2019s not so much that we are targeting a specific level. We cannot \u2013 not to target specific levels around things like that, because it is much about the asset footing as it\u2019s about liabilities. In our liability structure, we just like that having a diversified geographic client base, source of liabilities, we just think that\u2019s prudent risk management. When you think about it, it\u2019s all really about where various investors want to provide capital to the firm and so that\u2019s how we think about it. So we haven\u2019t set a target. The reason we don\u2019t set targets and things like that is we always are concerned about building up too much of a warehouse of liquidity, we obviously hold a very significant liquidity cushion at $193 billion. Like you don\u2019t want to feel yourself getting pressed into deploying those liabilities, you don\u2019t want the liabilities to drive your asset strategy, you want your liabilities to inform it and you want to have diversified safe funding. Brian Kleinhanzl : Do you anticipate that there will be some benefit on interest expense over time as you might take off maybe short-term borrowings? Harvey Schwartz : It could be over time I don\u2019t think in terms of the online deposit I don\u2019t see a huge cost advantage there. Again it\u2019s all maybe about how can we deploy that funding into the asset opportunities. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay great there was no other question. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Brian Kleinhanzl : Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein : Yes, hi. First question relates to commodities, you mentioned, so you talked about the lending exposure, but frankly I\u2019m not really interested in that I\u2019m more interested how you manage your counterparty exposure. And if you can talk a little bit about how you think about these trading entities that you deal with, how you are managing counterparty exposure considering rating downgrades that we have seen, but also concerns about some of these entities. And if you can just run us little bit through how you manage counterparty risk on your off balance sheet exposure? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. Hi Kian. I\u2019m sorry you must\u2019ve missed it what I was saying before was our exposure whether it\u2019s lending or through any derivatives or counterparty exposure to the trading entities is less than $200 million today. Kian Abouhossein : So that\u2019s your net exposure off balance sheet and on balance sheet? Harvey Schwartz : Yes correct that\u2019s for the trading out. Again they often intend to position us as more as competitors than clients. Kian Abouhossein : Yes. Harvey Schwartz : So that\u2019s our current credit exposure. Kian Abouhossein : And just in that context clearly you must adjust to rating downgrades as well as your own view around some of the counterparties, the margins or collateral calls etcetera. Can you just explain a little bit to us how you do that? You said the adjustment happening beside the credit ratings, which will drive it? Harvey Schwartz : We have a long history obviously managing counterparty exposure, which has been tested through pretty volatile markets and again the most important decision made at any point in time is when you establish that credit line it\u2019s really no different than lending, but obviously the dynamics are different. And we have a very diligent marking policy and we monitor collateral calls very vigilantly as you would imagine. And obviously as sectors are weaker you\u2019re very thoughtful about it, but when we make these decisions over long-term we have lot of experience doing it. Kian Abouhossein : Okay and in respect just coming back to your fixed-income business the way I at least to myself explain the weakness and please correct me if I\u2019m incorrect is the fact that you are weak on macro and weaker in corporate so just probably correlate it and you\u2019re strong in credit and hedge fund business. And first of all is that an incorrect assumption relative to your peers, I mean, especially some of your money centered peers? And secondly, if I\u2019m correct, what are you doing? Do you think about diversifying more as a business into and particular as a macro business? And what are you doing to adjust that mix? Harvey Schwartz : So, again, I don\u2019t have great visibility into the competitors. I would say, I do think there are two obvious things which I talked about before. We\u2019re not at big in emerging markets, again, we don\u2019t have a footprint in hundreds of offices and we\u2019re not a big lender to corporate. Our competitors are much greater lenders than we are. And so that certainly can influence your client base. In terms of macro, I think, you are wrong about that. And certainly, in commodities, we\u2019ve had a long history being commodities and it feels now like we\u2019re bigger in commodities as the number competitors have pulled away from the business. That \u2013 those are the effects I would give you in terms of what I can say. In terms of things we\u2019re trying to do, we feel pretty good about the diversified business. I mean, if you think about the course of the year to be sitting here basically nearly flat revenues with our fee-based business is picking up activity, which is compensating for our capital intensive parts of the firm, which you would expect to be more challenged in this kind of market environments. If you look at end of the day when you adjust for legacy costs, we\u2019re nearly a 12% ROE. I know the business grows pretty diversified. Kian Abouhossein : So you don\u2019t this argument valid off of the nimble credit geared to rather than macro in certain periods of the environment, depending on the environment we will just perform slightly differently from some of our peers, you don\u2019t see that against your money-centered peers? Harvey Schwartz : I think a lot of the peers have different footings, some are more domestic, some are more emerging-market base, I think the comparables are harder. Again look, take a look at the first quarter. In the first quarter, the way you look at it, we would have outperformed all the peers, that\u2019s information for us. But we\u2019re not going to steer the business in a different direction, because of that we\u2019re not going to over steer it [Technical Difficulty] their revenues on the surface would greater than ours. We\u2019re always going to look ways to improve the business. So that you should just incorporate by reference. Kian Abouhossein : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Kian. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully, I and other members of the senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the fourth quarter and full year results and I'm happy to answer any questions. Before outlining our results, I would like to discuss the previously announced settlement for legacy mortgage activities. As you know we took a total net provision for litigation and regulatory matters in the fourth quarter of $1.95 billion. The RMBS Working Group matter, was the most significant outstanding piece of litigation facing the firm. As you would expect, following a settlement, there has been a significant decline in our recently possible loss number. We are currently estimating a more than 60% decline compared to third quarter levels of $5.3 billion. Now turning to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $7.3 billion. Net earnings were $765 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.27. With respect to our annual results, we had Firm wide net revenues of $33.8 billion, net earnings of $6.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $12.14 and a return on common equity of 7.4%. Revenues were down slightly compared with last year and expenses were significantly higher due to approximately $4 billion of net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Despite these headwinds, we grew book value per share by 5%. The growth combined with our risk reduction efforts, strengthened all of our regulatory capital ratios. Excluding the litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, our 2015 return on common equity would've been 380 basis points higher. 2015 presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges were more acutely felt in the back half of the year, as concerns about global growth intensified, which is reflected in public equity markets, with the MSCI rolled down, 5.7% over the last six months of the year. Credit markets also reflected these concerns, particularly within the non-investment grade space and most acutely within the commodity sector. For example, U.S. high yield spreads were 157 basis points wider in the second half of 2015. And at the end of 2015, the trailing 12 month default rate for U.S. non-investment grade bonds more than doubled year-over-year climbing to 4.3%. These factors negatively impacted the broader opportunity set for our clients and as a consequence for the Firm. To varying degrees, the firm faced headwinds within certain of our FICC businesses, underwriting within investment banking and our investing and lending activities. However, these significant headwinds were largely offset by client activity in other businesses. Many of our clients decided to pursue M&A as the best means for creating shareholder value. And now M&A volumes for the industry increased by 47% in 2015. The Firm's volumes increased by 81%, a significant expansion of our market share. Our global equities franchise also posted strong results for the year. Clients continue to place significant value on the integration of our various services; electronic, cash, derivatives and prime brokerage as well as our global footprint. Our performance in 2015 highlighted these strengths. In addition, the combination of continued strong performance for our clients and the diversified set of offerings drove a record year for our Investment Management business. We ended the year with record assets under supervision of $1.25 trillion and robust net inflows, which totaled $94 billion. Ultimately, 2015 reinforced a long standing operating principle, that there is tremendous value to having a diversified set of global businesses. More importantly, it is the value of being a leader in these businesses that really counts. Now let's discuss the individual businesses in greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.5 billion, slightly lower than the third quarter. A pickup in M&A was offset by a decline in underwriting activity. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7 billion, up 9% from 2014 on the back of a 40% increase in financial advisory revenues. This was partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting revenues. Our franchise remains very strong. 2015 was our second highest annual revenues for Investment Banking. We ended the year ranked 1st in global and announced and completed M&A. Our completed M&A volumes were approximately $350 billion higher than our next closest competitor. A record gap, since we've been a public company. We were also ranked 1st in global equity and equity related and common stock offerings for 2015. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the fourth quarter; advisory revenues were $879 million, a 9% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including SunGard's $9.1 billion sale to Fidelity National Information Services. General Electric Capital Corporation's $9 billion sale of its Transportation Finance business to BMO Financial Group and HCC Insurance Holding's $7.5 billion sale to Tokio Marine Holdings. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including DuPont's combination with Dow Chemical in a $130 billion merger of equals, Newell Rubbermaid's $20 billion acquisition of Jarden Corporation and SanDisk's approximately $19 billion sale to Western Digital. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $616 million in the fourth quarter down 11% sequentially as debt issuance slowed. Equity underwriting revenues of $228 million were up 20% compared to the third quarter as IPOs increased from very low levels last quarter. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 21% to $440 million due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Visa's $16 billion investment grade offering to support its purchase of Visa Europe, McDonald's $6 billion investment grade offering and Worldpay Group's $3.8 billion IPO. Our Investment Banking backlog improved from third quarter levels and finished at its second highest level. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our fixed and equities businesses; net revenues were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, down 10% compared to the third quarter. For the full year, $15.2 billion of net revenues were roughly consistent with 2014. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter down 23% sequentially and included $54 million of DVA losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 10% quarter-over-quarter as many businesses were impacted by either lower client activity or more difficult market making conditions. Credit decreased significantly, as the market was characterized by widening high yields spread in the U.S. and low levels of liquidity. Interest rate in currencies were lower sequentially as client activity declined. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spread widened and the prospect for higher rates and client activity remained generally low. Commodities was essentially unchanged as client activity was muted and energy prices remained under pressure. For the full year, FICC Client Execution net revenues were $7.3 billion down 13% year-over-year, where challenging market conditions and lower levels of client activity in our micro businesses, credit and mortgages, offset stronger client activity and a favorable backdrop for our macro businesses, particularly rates and currencies. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.8 billion, flat sequentially and included $14 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution revenues were roughly consistent sequentially at $562 million. Commissions and fees were $763 million, down 7% relative to the third quarter as global client volumes declined. Securities services generated net revenues of $430 million up 13% sequentially. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.8 billion up 16% year-over-year. In 2015, we benefited from several factors, a better market backdrop and a more favorable environment from securities services. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $71 million down from $74 million in the third quarter. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion, primarily reflecting the company's specific events, including financings, sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $299 million which was largely driven by net interest income. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $5.4 billion driven by $3.78 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.66 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. In Investment Management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily as a result of $190 million in incentive fees largely from alternative asset products. Management and other fees were up 2% sequentially to $1.24 billion. For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 3% from 2014, on record management and other fees and higher transaction revenues. During the fourth quarter, assets under supervision increased $64 billion to a record $1.25 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity products. On a full year basis, we had long term fixed income flows of $41 billion, equity inflows of $23 billion, and alternative inflows of $7 billion. Moving to our performance, 73% of our client mutual fund assets ranked in the top two quartiles on a three year and a five year basis. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, remained roughly flat at $12.7 billion for 2015 and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 37.5%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion and incorporated $1.95 billion in litigation and regulatory expenses. The quarter also included a $123 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were up 30% due to $4 billion in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-compensation expenses would have been down 4% year-over-year. Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff at year end was approximately 36,800, up 8% from year end 2014. This is a significant increase, so let's breakdown the drivers. Of the 2,800 of incremental staff, a little more than half was due to our continued investment in regulatory compliance and other federation initiatives, largely in technology and operations. The remainder was focused on business growth initiatives, particularly with Investment Management. Our effective tax rate was 30.7% for 2015. Our global core liquid assets ended the year at $199 billion. While our balance sheet was roughly flat year-over-year, Level 3 assets declined by 33% to $24 billion. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.6% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.9%. With respect to our method to G-SIB surcharge, we currently estimate that we are at or near the lower bucket, given a decline in Level 3 assets and derivative notionals over the course of the year. And finally, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock for $1.65 billion in the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $4.2 billion. Year-over-year, our average fully diluted share count declined by approximately [15 million]. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.65 per share in the second quarter and paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends during the year. In total, we returned $5.4 billion of capital to shareholders in 2015. Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. Clearly, it has been a challenging environment for the entire industry. 2015 marks the fourth consecutive year that we have posted revenues of approximately $34 billion. Excluding litigation charges related to the RMBS Working Group, it is also the fourth consecutive year that we have produced strong relative results and returns that exceeded our cost of capital. We have been able to post consistent, strong relative results despite the difficult operating environment, which is a statement of the strength of our global client franchise, the caliber of our people and our culture of teamwork and adaptability. Over the past four years, we've also grown book value per share by 7% per annum, returned nearly $25 billion in capital to our shareholders and reduced our basic share count by 75 million shares or 14%. And most importantly we've been able to accomplish these things while maintaining leading positions across all of our businesses, transforming our financial profile, prudently managing our risks, adapting to regulatory change, continuing to invest in our future and positioning the Firm to provide significant operating leverage when the environment improves. There's no doubt that the second half of 2015 had its fair share of challenges, which significantly impacted market sentiment and client activity. It's quite natural for all of us to be influenced by recent events and we maintain a healthy respect to them. We certainly don\u2019t control the opportunities set, however we do control several things; how we build our client relationships, how we invest in our people, how we adapt to change, how we allocate our capital, manage our risks and control our costs, and finally, how we invest in the future. We believe our Firm's commitment to excellence in these areas has been and will continue to be what drives our performance over the long term. Thank you again for dialing in and I'm happy to answer your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I guess you're in a better position than most to ask this impossible question, but from your vantage point everything you see, are we on the cusp of a tougher credit cycle, balance sheet recession? Are we looking at the wrong things meaning, I'm about to ask you your energy exposure and I should be asking you your sovereign exposure to Italian sovereigns or Italian banks like, I'm just curious to your thoughts on where we are besides the market going down? Harvey Schwartz : So, look obviously the first couple of weeks of the year have been difficult from a market perspective and the last half of the year and continuing the dramatic decline in commodity prices broadly has been disruptive for the market. I think if you talk to our folks, obviously that sector of prices remain where they are, it's going to be under stress, that's an inevitability. But it does feel at this stage where perhaps the market is discounting some of the benefits of the declining commodity prices, we'll have to see how the market evolves. Look, these things are never going to be a straight line and so it's not surprising to some extent that the markets responding to China, reduced activity volatility in markets this way. In terms of our exposures to that sector, they haven't moved material since early [cost] across the entire oil and gas sector, Glenn. Funded and unfunded we had just more to $10 billion of exposure but to really dial it in for you, funded exposure to non-investment grade entities in that sector was a $1.5 billion as we finished the quarter. So, from our perspective we feel well positioned and in this kind of market environment, its type of market environment where your clients really want you to stay close to them and that's what we're doing. Glenn Schorr : A glass half full question of this increased volatility across some of the asset classes, using [indiscernible] clients of losing money, but is there any case to be made that [FICC] revenue pie can bottom and actually grow a little bit over the next say two years given the changing monetary landscape things like that monetary policy of landscape? Harvey Schwartz : We don't generally run the businesses as you know as pretty well. We don't run the businesses for the bull case, but I think that, and there certainly is a bull case in terms of fixed income activity. The stable to improving global growth and we're seeing that in the U.S., and we're seeing that across Europe certainly could be a tailwind diverging monetary policy, could be a tailwind. Look, as we go through parts of the credit cycle it's very natural for spreads to widen after having a period of such strength in the contraction. But even right now you're seeing the market, which has been under stress, be thoughtfully selective about those transactions and there's been a lot of appetite for certain parts of the market. So I think as we look forward over the next couple of years, when you start adding in things like the competitive environments. For all the potential activity around hedging and other activities, I think you could construct a pretty impressive bull case for fixed income and again it's not the way we generally run the businesses, we'll react to that as we see it. But there's a -- there certainly is an upside case. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. Last one it takes two seconds is, did you say that you're at or near the 250 bucket, was that your comment about the G-SIB at or near the lower bucket, is that what you meant by that? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, that's correct. I mean that's our estimation. That's obviously not confirmed by the regulators, but that's where we believe we stood at the end of the year. Glenn Schorr : Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Morning. Christian Bolu : So on Investment & Lending, could you remind us how much of the equity portfolio you need to divest before the 2017 Volcker deadline? And just given the current choppy markets, what's your level of confidence that the Firm can divest those assets by 2017? And also remind us what the process for getting an extension from the Fed is if you can't meet the 2017 deadline? Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, so roughly now we're under $5 billion of capital that is sitting in funds alongside our clients, which are obviously legacy funds. The exact number's roughly right around $4.7 billion. And with our expectation given these are legacy funds is that we'll continue to monetize those assets and we'll see how that progresses. There's a lot of runway between here and the compliance date in 2017. We haven't at this stage contemplated seeking any additional extensions and I don't believe the industry has at this stage. Christian Bolu : Okay thanks. And then maybe just some thoughts on the incremental operating leverage in the model, I mean the Firm has been very disciplined in expenses despite effectively four years of no top line growth. Just curious, how much more you can pull the expense lever to drive margin expansion or do you need some revenue growth there going forward? Harvey Schwartz : So obviously we've done a lot of work on expenses, we were very early to expense reduction initiatives. As you know we started several years ago and those have continued, for those businesses that have faced headwinds and we've been investing in those businesses that we feel we've had tailwinds. At that point, headcount's up 8% this year and compensation benefits were flat, so we've done a pretty good job at this stage. We'll continue to monitor it, but at this particular -- given all the work we've done we will always look to be more efficient, but I think we chopped a lot of wood here. Now we have really, we believe well positioned the Firm for an uptick in revenues and even though it feels like a long time ago now, you saw that in the first quarter of last year where on a modest up in revenues year-over-year we produced nearly a 15% ROE. So we feel very comfortable about the upside leverage. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks, for taking the question. Just on the G-SIB surcharge I think you mentioned you know part of that was exiting from Level 3 assets, I don\u2019t know if there's any granularity or clarity on what that was or what you got out of, but just curious on the any color around that? Harvey Schwartz : So generally speaking, you remember during the course of the year that there was a change to the FASB accounting which was a driver in terms of the NAV and the look through the funds and the other driver obviously, to get back to Christian's question which is as we monetize things they become public equities. As you know the public equity has been hovering between $3.5 billion and $4 billion also and that's part of the monetization process and obviously once the public equity, you have complete transparency on pricing. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it. And then just on the expenses, I think you guys you have mentioned, you have done a pretty good job of balancing the investing versus the environment, but just want to get your sense when you think about what you're focused on the regulatory, the IT side that you need to invest versus areas where if we are in weaker markets and activity starts to dry up, where can you pull back on the cost front? And so whether it's on the non-com side, although it seems like that's running pretty low ex the legal stuff, or on the comp side? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so I think -- but from a compensation perspective, compensation is always going to be driven by performance, most importantly at the Firm wide level and then obviously bottoms up from individuals to businesses and through [indiscernible]. And so that's where I think you'll see as related to the specific performance. We will always continue to look to be efficient. At this stage, obviously we're making a very significant investment in regulatory compliance. We think it's critically important. We actually think it's a competitive advantage to be best in class and so you'll see us continually invest in tech and businesses and over the long-term, we think it's a contributor to our performance. Michael Carrier : And last one, just on I&L, given that portfolio and just given maybe the market backdrop, if you can just remind us of what portion I guess mostly on the equity side, would be public that you're going to see more like mark-to-market versus the portion that might be on the private side that might be more driven by models or economic growth that's not going to swing around as much? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so coming into the end of the year, the public portion or public equity portion of the I&L balance sheet was $4 billion of notional. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: If you look at the size of the balance sheet, it came down by about $20 billion versus the end of the third quarter. Just thinking going forward how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends and then also with respect to SLR exposure? Harvey Schwartz : Well, so obviously all of our capital ratios give us a great deal of flexibility to respond to client demand, so we feel like we're well positioned. Now, we talk about there's a lot in the past. We went through a pretty significant early shift in shrinking the balance sheet and that was really about a replacing effort. And so we're going to be very sensitive to marginal deployment of capital ensuring that it's accretive in the long run and so you're going to be as we pretty sensitive to balance sheet growth, but obviously given the strength of our capital ratios, we have a lot of capacity. Matt O'Connor: And I guess following up on the SLR exposure specifically, you're obviously in excess of the 5% needed pre-CCAR, but for CCAR if you needed more, because do you have the ability to bring down some of the SLR exposure with only a modest impact to revenue? Harvey Schwartz : So, it's interesting the way you ask the question. I think you're basically saying, listen can we re-price the balance sheet in an accretive way? If we could, we should, so we're doing that work today. I think if the world became more constrained then by definition re-pricing would be necessary. And so a lot of it'll be driven by constraints, but if we found ourselves constrained to any particular category, we will make a long-term decision about how we wanted to address that. Look for us as you know, CCAR stress has been a constraint and you saw us react to that a bit ago when we shrunk the balance sheet so dramatically. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, one on I&L again, in the past sometimes you've given us some color on how much has been either realized or mark-to-market and I get the $4 billion on equity component. Just wondering, if you can give us some color on how much of the split between second equity is on -- of realized base versus a marked base? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so as you know Betsy we talk about in the context of event driven and non-event driven and that's what I talked about at the conference in the fourth quarter. So looking at I&L as I said during the quarter, net interest income was really the bulk a driver of the debt line and in terms of I&L relating to non-event driven most of the activity was really event driven or public marks. So things like refinancings, companies going public and then the subsequent public marks. Betsy Graseck : Okay and then on a question regarding the stress test, a lot of people thinking out loud about what potential scenarios the Fed could throw at us and I'm just wondering on prior stress tests, are you given full credit for the hedges that you have on in the various asset classes that you're trading in? Harvey Schwartz : We have no transparency in to that level of detail with respect to the Federal Reserve but they're pretty comprehensive in their analysis, so one would assume everyone gets credit for their hedges. Betsy Graseck : Right. In your own analysis that you're running obviously, you give yourself credit for hedges? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. In the stress scenario they would perform, so we give ourselves credit, I mean, yes. Betsy Graseck : Right, of course. Just to make sure. Harvey Schwartz : [indiscernible] company's scenario on our own submissions. Betsy Graseck : Correct in both. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, of course. Just like we'd model the Firm under any stress scenario. Betsy Graseck : So, when we're thinking about the commodity business that you've got, maybe you can talk through a little bit on how your positioned for the trend that we've been seeing here year-to-date? Harvey Schwartz : So, we've been very committed to the commodities franchise and obviously we have a very strong banking franchise and so this is a part of the cycle and I'd say, broadly across commodities where clients are going to be in need of advice, they are going to need capital market solutions, they're going to need potential hedging solutions depending on where they sit in the cost structure or scheme of things. And so I think a lot is expected when you marry those two strengths together with our research and analytic tools, I think we feel very well positioned to provide our clients with advice and value and solutions. Betsy Graseck : Do you see yourself taking share in this environment? Harvey Schwartz : In commodities -- well just talk commodities in a fixed income context, as I said in my prepared remarks, it's pretty obvious we took share in Investment Banking over the course of the year. I mean assuming you saw the big uptick in M&A, you saw a big outperformance by our team. In terms of the FICC activity, it's hard to see it when activity is low but certainly really not in comparison to commodities where activity has been high to us, we've picked up significant share but that's probably not surprising given how much people have pulled resources out of their commodity businesses or least they said, they have over the last couple of years globally. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I guess, I'll go to energy and how big a deal is this oil price decline to you guys? I mean you've mentioned you only have $1.5 billion in funded non-investment great exposure but your total exposures are over $10 billion. Where could you up potentially otherwise get hurt from the decline in oil prices other than that funded non-investment grade exposure? And where could be industry otherwise get hurt or you might have to pay attention to some of the counterparties that you have? Harvey Schwartz : So, from a counterparty exposure, our counterparty risk we feel good about right now, I think, I mentioned on an earlier call, if you take the example that the commodity trade houses, our exposure to those is less than $200 million as we sit here today. And I talk about the $10.6 billion that I brought out earlier, $6.4 billion of that -- again this is funded and unfunded, this is not funded, $6.4 billion out of the investment grade, so the maximum potential exposure we can get in non-investment grade companies would be $4.2 billion and that's absolute exposure that does not -- that's not recoveries or anything like that Mike. So, in terms of our capital position, I think we are relatively well positioned. I haven't gone through all the peer banks like you have but look for us, while we're very focused about and we're certainly not being complacent about it, we feel pretty front footed even on a relative basis, we have smaller exposures. Mike Mayo : What sort of reserves -- Harvey Schwartz : I think Mike for us, if this translates into somehow, which we don't see today but you never discount any possibility, if this somehow translates into a real drag on a long-term economic activity or economic growth, but as I said before when I was asked the question and it's just an opinion, lots of folks have been on this side of this discussion. When we talked to our people internally, it feels like the degree to which the market is focused on energy exposures has managed to discount the long term tailwind to the consumer and a reduction in cost across the globe. But that\u2019s how the markets we act into are now. So there maybe information content in that too. Mike Mayo : So what sort of reserves do you have against that $10 billion exposure? I guess some of its mark to market but some of it's not. Harvey Schwartz : So of the $10 billion obviously we\u2019re being thoughtful about our exposure. I can tell you for example the non-investment grade side, those reserves were in high single-digit percentages for that part of the portfolio. Mike Mayo : So lastly just are you able to hedge some of that exposure, are you helping your clients to hedge? Are you getting additional business activity to do this, and if you could just elaborate on the benefit to consumers because certainly people aren\u2019t paying much attention to that if that\u2019s there? Harvey Schwartz : I can\u2019t quantify the benefit of consumers to you, but obviously over time, that translates into more purchasing power because obviously it's a good thing that people are paying less in the punt, the obvious offset to that and maybe more acute in the U.S. is obviously there is a lot of pain in this sector and that will lead to increased unemployment specifically in this sector and it has infrastructure spend impact. In terms of hedging, we can hedge on a case by case basis, it really depends specifically on the underlying and where we can and we think we should. Obviously, we do. As it relates to client activity, one of the things about this move because it came down so quickly, is it really did not give a lot of our clients the opportunity to hedge to the downside. Obviously, in these low price levels across commodities you would expect to see a pick up in the consumer side of hedging activity and we expect to start seeing that. But these moves have been pretty dramatic and usually what happens when they are this sudden is there is a bit of stepping back. But certainly we\u2019re well positioned to provide hedges across the broad commodity space. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : So I wanted to broaden out the market share of activity question that came up before with respect to commodities. More broadly, with respect to FICC globally we\u2019ve seen so much retrenchment including a big domestic player recently. So, any signs yet that the retrenchment of competitors in the area is helping market share or helping pricing? And to what extent is what you\u2019re seeing there or the expectation of what you\u2019ll see there really driving some of that investing in the business that you\u2019re talking about? Harvey Schwartz : Well, we certainly have seen it across parts of the businesses, it\u2019s been somewhat episodic. We talked it before we\u2019ve seen it in securities services and prime brokerage, a bit of a retrenchment. I think that was more regulatory driven as people began to focus on balance sheet and capital related to that business. We\u2019ve seen it in parts of equity derivatives during the course of really now last year, year and a half. And then in fixed income, one of the things that shouldn\u2019t get lost about the fixed income discussion in 2015 for our Firm is that, while it was a difficult market for the micro products for credit and mortgages, it was actually an improved year for interest rates for currencies. And while commodity wasn\u2019t improving, came up very strong year prior, I think that we\u2019re seeing it when activity picks up. Now, in terms of the announcements and the retrenchment from competitors, one of these things is it's not surprising that you need to have a couple of or several tough years and that announcements will generally lag. And so, I think we may see this over the next couple of years now that we\u2019ve been in this period of a tough couple of years in FICC and where the vast majority of the industry has had multiple years of performing below their cost of capital. So all these things -- all these constraints are now really starting to come into the fray, particularly as we get into the 2018, 2019 compliance periods. Sorry, that was a long answer but it was a big question, but it was a long answer. Guy Moszkowski : No, it\u2019s a helpful answer. So I mean it sounds like you\u2019ve lost none of your confidence in the opportunity there, it just takes a while? Harvey Schwartz : Well, in terms of the competitive set, I think that\u2019s our read today. Look, in terms of monitoring the businesses, we\u2019re always monitoring the businesses. I think one of the things that, one of the things that we haven't talked a lot about, we haven't talked directly about is our philosophy and how we manage cyclical businesses. Everyone has to acknowledge that financial services is a cyclical industry and one of the things that we've been very thoughtful about is not over investing at the top of the market. So, you didn't see us do that in 2009 when FICC had a record year and making sure that we don't overshoot in the bottom part of the cycle. Now we were early to the cost cutting because we felt the activity levels declining after 2009 and that's how we managed through the cycle and you've seen us do this in the equity businesses and sometimes these cycles are long. We cut 1,000's of people in our equity franchise in the early 2000s but right now given all the work we've done on the cost side, we don\u2019t feel like we need to catch up. So, but we'll see how the year goes, if the trends in fixing can continue, we will continue to manage the business as efficiently as possible. Guy Moszkowski : And then just a follow-up question, since no one's asked it, I'll ask, I know we're only a few weeks into the year and the market backdrop has been, God awful, but how would you characterize activity levels since the beginning of 2016? Harvey Schwartz : It's only two weeks, so we're -- I'm not going to really extrapolate it. We generally don't root for the S&P 500 to be down 8% in the first two weeks of the year though. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe we should talk a little bit about M&A with the volatility that we've seen in the market I think some have been concerned I guess about the impact on M&A I guess both in the near term and what it means to for the cycle? Just maybe your just your broad thoughts on where we are in that cycle and what you're seeing in the conversation levels today? Harvey Schwartz : So, again obviously we had a pretty significant pickup in activity over the last year and Goldman Sachs market share grew dramatically with that. I think you have to take a step back and you have to ask yourself what are the factors that drove the M&A environmental [chord] over the past 18 months and are they still in place? And those core factors, is really limited organic growth, companies were struggling to find top line growth. You had positive but modest economic growth in major economies and companies had done quite a bit of work both on cost and refinancing going into that cycle and there was high level CEO and Board confidence. Those were the factors that drove the big pickup in activity. As we sit here today after couple of weeks of volatile markets, we wouldn't say that those factors are significantly diminished. We saw a very volatile August and yet in the fourth quarter, M&A activity continued and we finished our backlog higher than last year. And so, I think that we'll have to see obviously if markets stand the stress and you get into questions about finance-ability and other headwinds and then if we saw a loss of confidence, but we wouldn't say that two weeks of volatile markets would stop a pretty powerful M&A trend. We will see how these markets keep going. Jim Mitchell : And maybe just a follow-up on asset management. You had $48 billion of flows in liquidity products in the fourth quarter, what -- that seems pretty high. Can you -- what were the drivers there, is it, it's for the seasonal thing or are you seeing some market share gains there and as profitability improves with higher rates, do you see that as an opportunity? Harvey Schwartz : When you look across multiple quarters in asset management for us and you look at the flows and you look at the investment of the competitors I think you'd say we're gaining share. Obviously it's been a strategic focus for us to grow that business. In that quarter in particular I think it was a combination of volatile market and increasing rates, which brought money and obviously we're a leader in the money market business and so it was a catalyst for inflows. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Just a quick question on energy follow-up here I think you said $10 billion of total exposure, roughly two thirds in investment grade, is it right for us then to apply that sort of two-to-one investment grade, bull investment grade to your funded book as well and sort of back into about $3 billion funded IG exposure? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so why don't I just give you the -- I'll just give you the numbers so you will have all the detail. So $10.6 billion is what I would call total potential exposure. Funded is $1.8 billion, unfunded $8.8 billion. And of the funded non investment grade's $1.5 billion, and you could get an incremental $2.7 billion funded on that side. But that's the total exposure. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Harvey Schwartz : And you can fill in the rest of the grid on the investment grade stuff. Brennan Hawken : Yes, we can back in into the rest, thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura, please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So Basel published the updated guidance for the market risk calculations last week, I recognized the document and some of the calculations are pretty, the document says calculations are involved, I didn't know if you've done any preliminary analysis on the impact this might have on your pro forma market risk assets? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, you're talking about the fundamental view of the trading book that came out last week. So as you said it is a pretty big document, I think it was over 90 pages. We had the team going through it, I don\u2019t have any specific quantification for you. I think it'd be too early for me to put that out there and we still haven't even seen an NPR from the Federal Reserve. So we'll to see how this evolves. I would say the high level read is that from the early documents and the early discussion it seems like the regulators in the industry may continue to progress in terms of trying to find the right balance. But at this stage for us I don't see it being a significant impact but we'll give you more detail. Steven Chubak : All right, I suppose over the last few quarters it does look like the market risk assets have been steadily declining. I didn't know if that reduction was in anticipation of what might be tougher rules or are there other factors that are really driving that decline? Harvey Schwartz : No definitely certainly not in anticipation of this, I mean just to be clear, we'll approach this rule like we've approached all the other rules. We don't want to try to adjust our business potentially have a negative impact to your clients. The one good thing, regulators have been very thoughtful about the runway to rule adoption. And this is something that we have till 2019. So the industry is going to have time to make adjustments and I think that's in everyone's best interest because it actually will be less disruptive to market, the incentive of this rule is significant and we've seen that in all the rules and so you'll see us approach this rule the way we approached all the other rules. But we haven't even seen as I said a Fed NPR so we'll see how that goes. But any reduction in market risk assets is really a [complexion] of client activity. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay, and just one quick follow up, I did see that the advance Core Tier 1 did in fact decline quarter-on-quarter. I assume it's a function of the increase in operational risk tied to the settlement but didn't know if it was attributable to something else? Harvey Schwartz : No that's correct. So the settlement added $21 billion to operational risk assets and it had a corresponding decline in the ratio of roughly 40 basis points. Steven Chubak : Great, I appreciate you taking my questions. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities, please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning, Harvey. Just a couple of questions, I guess starting on M&A. We've heard across both you and to a lesser extent some of your competitors about the potential for market share gains as some non-U.S. participants back away. But I think that's mostly focused, that those comments are mostly focused on the trading side of things. Given your market share gains in M&A this year, do you get the sense that that's also true with Investment Banking in specifically M&A transactions? Harvey Schwartz : No, I haven't had a chance to dig through all the lead tables and I may not have this perfectly accurate but the last time I spoke to our team about this, I think it was really that there's a segment of banks which lost share to some of the boutiques and there's firms like ourselves which obviously gained market share broadly across the board, and we took share from everyone else. Matt Burnell : Okay and then just on FICC and trading, you've given us some helpful commentary and I realize it's early days in the year in the quarter, but I guess I'm curious, so what the level of rate positioning within your client base has been, did that change dramatically late in the fourth quarter with the Fed's action and has it changed much so far this year? Harvey Schwartz : Not a significant factor, really nothing to comment on that. Obviously, the Fed reserve data, very good job of communicating to the marketplace the first rate increase in December and I think to a great extent that it being a non-event, which is a good thing. And so early in the quarter it was influencing client activity, but by the time the event occurred, obviously it wasn\u2019t significant. Matt Burnell : And just finally for me, I don\u2019t think you've given these. Can you provide us the fully phased in capital ratios at the end of the year? Harvey Schwartz : Sure, so under the advanced, we were 11.7 and under standardized 12.9. I remember that on a apples-to-apples basis, that's a little bit conservative just given away some of the items actually transitioned to fully phased in, but that's where we stood at. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : I've obviously heard everything that you have said this morning and I recognize of course that you don\u2019t run the business to any particular metric ratio, but to the extent that revenue conditions sort of stay as they've been over the past few years and call it around that $34 billion level. Is there a path to generate incremental positive operating leverage for you? Harvey Schwartz : So it's an interesting question. I'm going to modify it a little bit because of the way I heard it, maybe I'm not modifying because it is the way I heard it. I think you're saying if I knew over the next couple of years, like let's just say we had a crystal ball and with certainty I knew that the Firm is going to [gross] $34 billion over the next couple of years. Now, I guess what you're saying is the thing that we've elected to invest in, we shouldn\u2019t be investing in and so I think we wouldn\u2019t invest for growth because you're telling me it wouldn\u2019t be there, but that's not our expectation. We see growth in parts of our businesses and so where we see growth and where we think we can take share, we're going to invest. And again, we run the Firm for multiple years and so -- but that's the way I would think about answering the question, but we see opportunities. Eric Wasserstrom : And what conditions would arise or what would be the signals to you that in fact it is appropriate to retrench on some of the growth opportunities? Harvey Schwartz : Well, we always evaluate -- and at the end of the day, it's really about the dialog with the client. The dialog with the client, so let's take M&A, we just talked about the things are interesting because now the current concern is that M&A may slow down. Five years ago, you'll remember the dialog was M&A is never coming back. And last year, we had dominant market share and tremendous activity levels across the industry. In 2009, our client dialog told us there were factors that were influencing decisions that were delaying decisions, but it certainly didn\u2019t tell us that no one would ever do mergers again. And so when we see, when we listen to the client and we know for example that our clients in fixed income still value the services, they just need to do more volumes, that's how we'll inform our strategy over the long run. But obviously we're not being complacent, you've seen all the things we've done. We've returned significant capital, we've cut costs and we're early to all those things, we have reduced risk, improved our ratio, so we're certainly not sitting still here. Revenues might be $34 billion for a couple of years because a lots going on. Eric Wasserstrom : And so at times as if then the indication is at this stage there's no change in client dialog or demands or expectations. Harvey Schwartz : No. Certainly not. After the first couple of weeks of the year, no. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Building on what you were just talking about, what are the things as the pipeline keeps building quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year that the customers are saying are delaying, so what factors do you need to see some of that pent up demand begin to get released and accelerate some of the activities you have seen even at the levels last year? Harvey Schwartz : So I think look again at its core, we're correlated to long-term economic growth and what we're really seeing in the markets in the second half of the year was really general concerns about economic growth that might be isolated to specific markets but really that's what was driving activity levels. I think more than anything else client conviction and I mean that in all spaces, whether we're managing a client's money, their conviction, their confidence, whether we're advising on a merger transaction, the CEO and the Board and the CFOs, their confidence levels. The same thing exists in the capital markets businesses and fixed income and equities. Now what leads to that, confidence in economic growth, reduced uncertainty. And so those are the factors that fuel activity. Marty Mosby : I will ask you I think a more as a peer kind of question but I think it has some pertinence to what's going on. Given the rules that limited your ability and all the market makers ability to take on any risk, turning you basically into a conduit of transactions, when we see these types of disruptions in the marketplace, what are your traders saying in the sense of, how activities and clearing levels and new equilibriums get reached, when there isn't really any buffer still left in the market? So we're seeing some of the ramifications of Volcker now in distressed markets which can have I think some very unfavorable effects just on trading levels to get to a new clearing equilibrium? Harvey Schwartz : Look, I don't know, if you and I are going to solve that, heated debate on a lot of different sides around the benefits of regulation, which are obviously numerous versus some of the unintended consequences potentially around liquidity. I would say, we feel like we had more than adequate capital and liquidity to be there for our clients and that's how we're positioning ourselves. Marty Mosby : I guess, I just do you feel like the answers at certain times get to be over blown one way or another because of that unintended consequence? Harvey Schwartz : I think that is a very complicated question which is very difficult for anyone to answer, which is, there's my own view there is not a rule that has had a big impact on market liquidity or lending across industries. I think something that's very difficult for anyone to quantify is, what is the economic impact of the collection of rules that have been put in place since the financial crises that impact capital liquidity, derivative, all sorts of things. I just think that, it's very hard to anticipate the combined effect of all that. But for us, we're just focused on the clients, Marty. Marty Mosby : And then do you think the markets evolving to adapt to all that and how far along that process are we and that's last piece of that question. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : I think firms are in different places. We've obviously invested tremendously in risk reduction change, technology tools, educating our people. So I think we feel pretty far along the curve. You have seen in our capital ratios and in the Firm's balance sheet how much has changed over the last. But I think it varies across the industry and so I really can't speak to everybody else. Marty Mosby : Right, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks. Just a quick question on Investment Management, I mean, you've benefited from a couple of acquisitions there over the last year. Did you actually budget for growth from acquisitions as you look forward and what's the investment in that area expected to be? Harvey Schwartz : So you've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions, the one I think you are referring to this year was Pacific Global Advisors which was $18 billion in asset and they are focused on the pension and retirement space. We don't budget for acquisitions at all. We do it on a case by case basis and acquisitions that generally are a little bit simplified. They either give us a capability that we don't have today and we think it's better for us to have bolt-on versus build organically or they actually fit a current strength where we can add scale. That's like -- that's kind of the extreme end of the spectrum in terms of how we think about them, but it's a 100% case by case. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay and then just a follow up question on the Basel III and I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give the RWA for the fully phased-in ratios? Harvey Schwartz : No, I didn't for the four -- do you want the fully phased-in? Brian Kleinhanzl : Correct, yes. Harvey Schwartz : So for fully phased-in, we are at 430 of credit risk and 104 marked risk, sorry about that. I was looking -- that was at standardized, another advance 587 that\u2019s 103 in operational, 353 in credit risk, 103 in market risk, sorry about that. Operator : Your next question is a follow up from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So Harvey just on that same topic, it looks like your standardized RWA sequentially came down 10%. And I just wanted to know, first, what\u2019s the driving force behind that and just given the magnitude of the decline? And also just to clarify, that\u2019s the number that matters for the CCAR submission, if I remember correctly. Is that right? Harvey Schwartz : That\u2019s correct. So, the standardized is the ratio using CCAR and the driver, the bulk of the driver was really in derivative notionals. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : Everyone, thanks for dialing in today. And, myself and the rest of the team, we look forward to seeing you during the course of the year. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Dane and the team. Take care and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs' fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 19, 2016. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane E. Holmes - Head- Investor Relations : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial conditions may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio. You should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the first quarter results and I'm happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $6.3 billion; net earnings, $1.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share, $2.68. Net earnings to common included a $161 million benefit related to the successful tender of our APEX securities. The tender added $0.36 per diluted share. The first quarter of 2016 was challenging. It started with renewed uncertainty about the global economic outlook, with the possibility of a recession even being raised. These concerns included growth prospects from China, plummeting oil prices, a strengthening U.S. dollar, and multiple geopolitical events, to name a few. All these came into focus during an eventful first quarter. These concerns translated into significant price pressure at the beginning of the quarter across both equity and fixed income markets. The Dow declined by 6% in the first week. This is the worst start in its nearly 90-year history. The index ultimately reached its low point in mid-February, declining 10%. Equity markets in other geographies endured even more material declines during the quarter, with the Shanghai down as much as 25% and the Nikkei down as much as 21%. Credit spreads also widened significantly intra-quarter, particularly for high yield and energy-related issuers. Global Central Bank activity was front and center again during the quarter. After raising rates in December for the first time in more than nine years, the market heavily debated the Federal Reserve's future actions. In the eurozone, the European Central Bank took additional stimulus measures well beyond what was initially expected by the market. And finally, the Bank of Japan moved interest rates into negative territory. With all these factors at work, it isn't surprising that it resulted in a difficult operating environment for our clients and, by extension, constrained opportunities in each of our business segments. Within Investment Banking, for example, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes declined by 57% year-over-year. Performance was challenged for many of our ICS clients. For example, nearly 80% of the largest active U.S. equity mutual funds underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. As you would expect with markets flat-to-down worldwide, our equity investing business was negatively impacted. And finally, incentive fees declined during the quarter due to limited harvesting opportunities. With that as a backdrop, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion, 5% lower than the fourth quarter as we saw lower client activity across M&A and equity underwriting. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased since the end of the year but is still up relative to a year ago. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the first quarter, Advisory revenues were $771 million. 12% decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion cash tender offer from ChemChina; Valspar's $11.3 billion acquisition by Sherwin-Williams; and ADT's $12 billion acquisition by Apollo. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including BG Group's \u00a347 billion acquisition by Royal Dutch Shell; BT Group's\u00a312.5 billion acquisition of EE Limited; and PETCO Animal Supplies' $4.6 billion sale to a consortium of investors. Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $692 million in the first quarter, up 4% sequentially as a pickup in debt underwriting more than offset a slowdown in equity issuance. Equity underwriting revenues were $183 million. This was down significantly compared to the fourth quarter due to a decrease in offerings industry-wide. Debt underwriting revenues were up 16% to $509 million and benefited from strong investment-grade issuance. During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Newell Rubbermaid's $8 billion financing to support its acquisition of Jarden, Vista's $4 billion loan and bond offering to support its acquisition of Solera, and Devon Energy's $1.5 billion follow-on offering. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, up 20% compared to the fourth quarter. In the quarter, we early-adopted the new accounting standard for DVA, which is now captured in other comprehensive income. DVA for the current quarter was immaterial. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially, as client activity improved in many businesses from weak fourth quarter levels. As I mentioned, the operating environment across the FICC complex was quite difficult due to macro uncertainty and volatile markets. This led to a challenging backdrop for our clients with weak investment performance and drove difficult market-making conditions for the firm. The environment in the first quarter of 2016 stands in stark contrast to the environment in the first quarter of last year. Consequently, there was a substantial downward revenue pressure year-over-year. Interest rates and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity and interest rates held up relatively well. However, activity within currencies declined compared to a strong first quarter of last year. Credit also decreased significantly as market conditions remained difficult, particularly in Europe. Commodities was weaker as client activity was muted with energy prices remaining low. Mortgages continue to be challenged as spreads widened for some products and client activity remained low. In Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 1% sequentially. First quarter results in Equities were roughly consistent with the back half of last year but significantly weaker compared to a robust performance in the first quarter of 2015. Net revenues declined 23% year-over-year and reflected the impact of a challenging environment for our clients and the firm. Equities client execution net revenues of $470 million were down significantly year-over-year. Higher volatility and global equity market weakness at the beginning of the quarter impacted investor conviction and risk appetite. Commissions and fees were $878 million, up 9% year-over-year as client activity increased in our lower touch electronic channels. Security services generated net revenues of $432 million, up 10% year-over-year on improved spreads. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $72 million, up slightly from $71 million in the fourth quarter. Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $87 million in the first quarter. In equity securities, markdowns on public investments entirely offset net revenues in private investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $87 million. Revenues were driven by net interest income. This was partially offset by increased provisions on our corporate energy exposures. In Investment Management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion. This was down 13% from the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower incentive fees and management and other fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were down 6% sequentially to $1.2 billion due to a change in the mix of client assets and strategies. Assets under supervision increased $35 billion sequentially to a record $1.29 trillion, primarily due to net inflows into liquidity and long-term fee-based products. We had $16 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, $10 billion of long-term net inflows, primarily driven by fixed income and equity products, and $9 billion of market appreciation. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as benefits, declined by 40% versus the first quarter of 2015. The significant reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects the more challenging revenue environment and translated into a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, significantly lower than the fourth quarter and 6% lower than the first quarter of 2015. This is the lowest quarterly level since the second quarter of 2009. Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 36,500, down 1% from year-end 2015. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $196 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $878 billion and $24 billion, respectively. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III Advanced approach. It was 13.4% using the Standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6%. And finally, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $1.55 billion in the quarter. In conclusion, the first quarter was obviously a difficult period for our clients, the markets and our opportunity set. While clearly we don't control the opportunity set, we proactively took action in key areas that we do control : our cost structure and our capital. In addition, this is the first quarter in a while that we faced significant headwinds across each of our business segments. Given that we operate in a cyclical industry, it shouldn't be surprising that there will be difficult quarters. That being said, we don't create deep client relationships in a quarter, we don't hire our people for a quarter, and we certainly don't build businesses for a quarter. Our success has been predicated on having a strong culture that promotes both a long-term perspective, while simultaneously being very focused on managing to the current environment. That long-term focus has been the foundation for building a leading global investment bank and creating superior results for our shareholders. As we look forward, we are committed to remaining nimble and efficient operators, disciplined capital allocators and prudent risk managers. Our commitment to these principles has been and will continue to be the basis for our performance over time. Thanks again for dialing in, and I'm happy to answer your questions. Operator : Please limit yourself to one question and to one follow-up question. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. Thanks very much. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, good morning, Glenn. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Maybe we could talk about Fixed Income first. I'm just looking big picture. Revenue is a little more than half the big banks and that was obviously not always the case. I'm just curious, are there specific things about your business mix and client mix that doesn't compare as much versus the past in activity levels, things like credit being real slow right now? And if you feel like any of the balance sheet reductions or Volcker implementation has impacted the forward earnings power? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Obviously, I don't have great transparency into the competitors' footprints. I don't think that any of the things you mentioned, sort of the balance sheet actions we've taken because they've been very surgical \u2013 although meaningful they've been very surgical over time and very thoughtfully executed. I don't think those are issues and, obviously, all firms have adjusted to Volcker. So, I don't think those are drivers. I think when you look at the year-over-year, obviously, we had a very strong first quarter 2015 relative to the peer set. And I know revenue is the most transparent benchmark you have. But when you look at the performance in the first quarter, obviously we outperformed in the first quarter of last year and obviously much more challenging for us this quarter. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Yeah, totally fair. Okay. Maybe if we switch over to Investing & Lending. I want to focus on the equity side specifically. In some markets, you had the markets go down and then come back. Asia didn't snap back. So, I wonder if you could talk about the contribution of that in the quarter. And then, more importantly, for the equity dynamic going forward, like maybe size the portfolio fair value versus cost basis, see if there are any marks in the quarter that, knock on wood don't repeat next quarter? And then just see if you can update us on what's left to sell down to get compliant? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, okay, that's a multipart question. So if I miss anything, get back. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : All right. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it's fine. So in terms of the I&L balance sheet, let's just start there. The I&L balance sheet is $99 billion. Of that, in terms of \u2013 you spoke about equity, roughly $15 billion of that is corporate equity. In terms of the equity line, both private and public, basically the public portfolio was down roughly $140 million during the quarter and that was offset by private marks. Of those marks that were positive, they were virtually all event-related. And you remember, that's the language you use, Glenn, to describe the fact that there's a sale or a refinancing and then there were negative marks in the portfolio obviously also. So that's really the structure in terms of the course of the quarter. In terms of Volcker, because I think you're asking about the equity funds? Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Yes. Correct. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, in terms of Volcker, basically if we start at the top of, let's just say the waterfall, there's $7.5 billion in covered funds. You then have to take out approved Volcker activities. Then you take out the public money. And the way we've asked you to look at it is there's roughly $4.5 billion remaining. And that money obviously sits alongside our clients in these funds. Is there anything else you asked that I missed? Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : No, that's perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Christian. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So you mentioned a mix shift in asset management impacting revenues. Can you give a bit more color on this and if you expect it to reverse going forward? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year as we work through, obviously, there are various client segments we work with, whether they're retail clients, private wealth, also institutional clients. And what we're really seeing is a mix shift more to institutional mandates during the period. That had an impact. I think longer term, obviously, I can't predict the longer term. We're looking to basically provide service to all those clients as best we can through long, long cycles. But you're seeing obviously the positive inflows which are quite good. So if you ask me to think of the future, I would point more to the flows than the asset mix. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. And then on the GE deposits that you got in, just curious how we should think about what kind of economics you can earn on that and any time line for deployment? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the transaction closed on Friday. It went quite smoothly. We're up and running under the GS moniker. I would encourage you to think of this really as we've described it, which is, this is all part of our funding diversification. In that sense, we always, as you know, look to have a diversified funding base. This is just an extra toolkit for us in the financing and so we'll view it over time. But in terms of driving revenues, it's really part of our liability management strategy. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, helpful. And then a very quick modeling question for me. Tax rate was a bit lower in the quarter. Just curious how we should think about the go-forward tax rate? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So in terms of the go-forward, I guess if I was to give you a best estimate, I'd say something similar to last year. Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you very much, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Christian. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks a lot. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Mike. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Harvey, maybe first just on the revenue backdrop, I just wanted to get your sense when you look at the January/February trends versus, say, March/April, maybe areas where you're starting to the see some improving trends. I know in any given quarter it's kind of tough on, I think, the market share standpoint, but I feel like when revenues are weak you can't really tell market share and then when revenues rebound, you can figure out who gained and who lost. But just given some of the competitive dynamics, just wanted to get a sense if you're starting to see any of that in terms of the market share? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I just want to make sure understand \u2013 I answer your question completely. In terms of the quarter, the way I would describe it is March was better than February and February was better than January. It's early in April, so it's obviously pretty early in the quarter, but I would say that it really feels like many of the factors that were impacting the market in the first quarter, particularly early on, seem to have abated and although the market feels a little fragile from all that, it feels like \u2013 for the most part, that feels like that's behind us. But we'll see how the year progresses. In terms of the longer-term observation around the competitive dynamic, again, in a quarter like this, hard to see it when our clients are experiencing such volatility and such stress, but I think based on announcements and parts of the business where we're seeing client flows move, engagement with clients is quite good and we're getting good feedback. So I think a quarter like we just had actually only makes the competitor forward look better, but we'll see. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on, I guess, I&L and Investment Management, obviously I&L had some pressure and then Investment Management, just like the performance fees were weaker than expected. When you look at what has happened through the quarter and the rebound in the markets, I'm trying to just gauge on the parts of the business that are as simple as markets are up and so you should start to see some improving trends versus maybe on like the I&L, you mentioned the provision on the debt side. So how significant or how much follow through are we going to see that could maybe weigh on that part of the business? And same thing on the incentive fees or the performance fees in Investment Management. I don't know if there's a way to gauge the types of products that generate the performance fees, how much are absolute versus relative or what products are below hurdles? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, so as it relates to I&L, just to level set everyone, obviously we created that disclosure to provide more transparency, and that is, as you described it, the most price-sensitive asset parts of the balance sheet. And so that's why I provide it that way. So, as I mentioned, for example, there are parts of the portfolio, as you know, that are public equity securities where, again, we may sit alongside our clients. As those are monetized out of a fund, there are restrictions and lockup periods. And so that portfolio, as I mentioned, was negative roughly $140 million during the course of the quarter. And so there will be some element idiosyncratic movement. Sometimes that portfolio will outperform. When you look at history, it has generally outperformed. Even if you take the last eight quarters including this quarter, the entire I&L segment has generated $11 billion in revenues. In terms of incentive fees, it's going to be specific, obviously, to performance, which has been solid, but obviously markets are going to have an influence on incentive fees also. Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks a lot. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you hear me? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Matt, are you there? Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yep. Can you hear me? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We can hear you now. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sorry about that. Just a big picture question. Can you just talk a bit about the disconnect between the markets, the improvement that we're seeing there and what still feels like sluggish client activity, maybe better than January/February, but here's the S&P up a couple percent year-to-date, credit spreads have tightened. I guess the question is, like, is it a timing issue where we need more stability for activity to pick up in a bigger way, or is it the underlying economy's not strong enough? Just any big picture thoughts you have on that disconnect? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So something that I think you're certainly seeing a pickup \u2013 if you look at IPOs, I think there were something in the first couple weeks of April approaching 40 IPOs during the first couple weeks. So certainly elements of the marketplace which obviously slowed down very specifically. But I think after a tough first quarter like the whole market has experienced, I think that there may be a slow reaction function in terms of how various market participants engage the marketplace. But it feels like, as I said before, the most significant factors impacting the first quarter seem to have abated, at least for now. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just kind of on an incremental basis, like where do you feel like the engagement \u2013 you mentioned the IPOs picking up, but I guess a timeline? Usually you see trading pick up first and then M&A tends to lag, or what do you think we see beyond IPOs in terms of areas that start to pick up first, assuming we get a pickup in activity? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think generally I would agree with your statement over very long periods of time, but I think in terms of the M&A cycle that we're in now, while off a little bit from the levels of 2015, the level of dialogue there feels quite good. As I mentioned, our backlog across advisory, equity and debt is up year-over-year after a strong year. So the dialogue and level of engagement feels quite good at this stage. Certainly there was an element to the first quarter which had a bit of a chilling effect for a period, but right now the dialogue feels good. We'll see how it goes in the future. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just separately on expenses, obviously good cost control in a tough revenue quarter. You did mention about continuing to manage to a difficult revenue environment if that continues, but maybe just expand on that? We've seen some things in the media about further cost cuts coming. So, anything you can elaborate on the cost side would be helpful. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So obviously we're \u2013 look, we always have our eye on ways we can look to operate more efficiently. We've talked about it a lot, that this is a performance-driven culture, and the performance wasn't great in the first quarter and as a result you saw compensation and benefits expense down 40% year-over-year. Again, that's our culture, and so you're going to see those adjustments. In terms of other cost initiatives, I know there's been a lot of stuff in the press. I guess I would really summarize it as follows. I would just say we're shareholders and we're doing things that you would expect shareholders to do. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. The CEO letter talks about secular changes versus cyclical changes and you guys have been steadfast saying that the markets are simply in a cyclical lull, they'll recover. They haven't recovered but you've kept your infrastructure. So at what point do you say maybe these cyclical lulls are more permanent and you need to take more dramatic actions? And it looks like year-over-year your trading is the worst among the five big U.S. wholesale banks. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think I just want to clarify one thing. Because I think one of the messages that maybe gets mistranslated as it comes across is \u2013 and let's just pick FICC, because I think that's really what you're talking about when you talk about trading. We have expressed a commitment to FICC. What we mean by that, very explicitly, is we're committed to our clients and we're committed to providing superior returns over the cycle. Commitment does not mean inaction, and I think that's what gets a little bit confused in this message. And actually, as far as I can tell, Mike, all of our U.S. peers, they're committed to FICC, too. But back to Goldman Sachs for a second. If you think about the things we've done over the last couple of years, since the middle of 2013 we've taken the ICS balance sheet down 25% and FICC RWAs, market and credit down 30%. On the cost side \u2013 we've been very focused on the capital side, and on the cost side since the beginning of 2012, we've taken FICC related head count down 10, and we've taken compensation down by more than 20%. So, I wouldn't say that there's been any inaction. However, I would reiterate that we've been quite committed to our clients and committed to the return. Now, look, this has been, and I admit it, because I agree with you, Mike, this has been a tough period and this has been a long cycle. But we have a long history of managing our business across the cycle. In 2009, we didn't overinvest in the top, and we're going to be thoughtful about not underinvesting but we are certainly responding to the last several years of decline in (30:04) revenue. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : I guess, as a follow-up, I mean, what else can you do? You've danced pretty well the last three to four years without revenue growth, but it seems like you're getting to the end of what you can do and your return on equity is now in the single-digit range, and I think consensus has it in the single-digit range for the year. I know you would not want to see that. So what are your other options? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, look. I think you're right to point out that for four years running we are one of the very small handful of firms that have had double-digit ROEs. This is a quarter, I certainly wouldn't sit here and tell you, we are happy about this quarter, but we will do what it takes over time to make sure that we deliver for our clients and maximize the returns for our shareholders in a prudent way. So we are quite focused. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Betsy. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Couple of questions on the fixed income line or the debt line on the I&L? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, typically I think the NII is around $225 million quarter, and I know you posted $87 million, and you indicated the delta is largely due to energy. I'm just wondering, should I take that to mean that the reserve, or the provision, or the mark-to-market in energy was around $138 million or is there more there? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the NII was roughly $240 million and then the offset within provisions, and the majority the offset, about two thirds was in energy related. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So that feels like it would probably double the reserve ratio that you had posted last quarter. Is that \u2013 it would more than double it. Is that a reasonable assumption? Or maybe you could talk us through how you're thinking about them? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it is not. When you actually look at it \u2013 I think the best way to look at this is with the funded portion of the non-investment grade portion of the energy portfolio. It was high-single digits last quarter, and it remains high-single digits. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And that's because you either used some of the provision to \u2013 you wrote off some of your exposure? Is that accurate or... Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the exposure \u2013 why don't I just walk you through it? Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So \u2013 yeah. So in the oil and gas sector, this period, including funded, unfunded, investment-grade and non-investment grade was $10.7 billion. That's up from $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter. Now let's just focus on non-investment grade. Non-investment grade is $5 billion. That's up from $4.2 billion. In part, obviously that's driven up by ratings downgrades and actions by the ratings agencies during the course of the quarter, and the funded portion of that is $1.6 billion, and that was up about $100 million. So you can kind of matrix back through all that, and you can see the shift in the portfolio was a result of the ratings agencies. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just ticky-tacky, is the fully phased in for the capital ratios, the CET1, the SLR? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the fully phased-in ratios, they are flat quarter-over-quarter, advanced is a 11.7%, and standardized is 12.9%. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. All right. Thank you. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Guy. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Hey, good morning. So I'm going to ask a question that's really going to drill down on one that came a couple of minutes ago on the degree of commitment to FICC in particular. Goldman is obviously a leader in applying technology to traditional voice trading businesses and other things, and you've been pretty vocal in the past about how you transformed equities, and foreign exchange, and cut head count while picking up market share and the process. It seems like FICC has really reached a tipping point recently because of regulatory change and what's going on in the markets and yet the digitization process is maybe trickier in FICC. And, so I was hoping you could give us some color on how much transformation do you expect in the capital structure and the expense structure of fixed income for your business? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, first and foremost I'd say the thing that drive the strategy is not digitization in and of itself, it's how we engage our clients. You're right to point out that the equity business went through a pretty significant evolution. While that evolution in historical perspective feels short, it was a multiyear process that really began in 1999 and it finished in the mid 2000s and continues to evolve. I don't know necessarily that I would agree with that we're at a tipping point. It's all about opinions. But it feels like we're in an evolution where obviously clients are looking for efficiencies and we're looking for efficiencies, but the reality is that a vast majority of the fixed income market is more bespoke; it won't lend itself to that. But to the extent to which we can deliver to our clients and drive efficiencies, we're obviously very focused on it. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : So, is it right though, for us to think that there is going to be a significant transformation in the cost structure and the capital structure that you apply to FICC over the next couple of years? Or would that be too dramatic? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well I think, look, you've seen some of the evolutionary steps we've taken in terms of the balance sheet reductions and the risk-weighted assets that I talked about earlier. It may be the case that over periods of time, depending on how much client activity there is, but the extent to which it shifts to electronic channels like we've seen under the regulatory framework for swap execution facilities, those transitions happen very, very quickly, and we adjust very, very quickly. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP : Okay. That's helpful in terms of perspective. Thank you very much. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Yeah. Morning, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Kian. Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Just wondering on market share movements, how you see that progressing, considering we have clear strategies of reduction of some of the European IBs as well as Nomura now. How do you see that coming through in your numbers? Do you see that at this point? And how you position to take part of these market share gains as others are retrenching? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, as you and I talked about over the last couple of years, I don't think we would have imagined a couple of years ago that the industry would be in a position where three of the largest firms were going through a change in leadership and what appears to be a very, very significant change in strategy. That change in strategy is different for all of them, some of them it's geographically driven, some so far, some of it is pulling resources back from certain businesses like derivatives. To us, it feels like the feedback is quite good. Obviously difficult to see that in a really tough first quarter, but I would say on the ground, the feedback is good and it continues to improve our position. With respect to how we're positioned, I think we feel tremendously well positioned given our footprint. Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Okay. And in respect to your fixed income business, looking at your VaR in commodities, it declined a lot year on year, although volatility must have gone up in the commodity space. I'm just wondering it looks to me there's been a proactive reduction overall in the first quarter. Do I understand that correctly? And did that have an impact on your revenue impact in FY 2016? Just trying to put the picture together. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, as I spoke about in the early remarks, commodities were down year-over-year, that really \u2013 the VaR reductions you're really seeing are more reflection of the environment. While there was volatility during the course of the period, obviously in commodities, client flows were pretty muted as people really were a bit taken back, I wouldn't say in shock, but a bit taken back by the depressed energy prices and the movement down. It didn't translate into lots of activity during the course of the quarter. Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc : And if I may, just follow-up on that, do you see an improvement through March and April, both in liquidity terms and in terms of a client activity in the space? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. As I said before, March was better than February and February was certainly better than January. So I would say that's been the general trend. As I said before, the factors that really were impacting the market so severely in the first quarter, at least for now, they seem to have abated. Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc : Thank you. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Just wanted to \u2013 I hate to beat a dead horse, but maybe just talk about FICC a little bit, maybe just more strategically? With regulators sort of turning their eyes to the buy-side and potentially cracking down on leverage and forcing more liquidity, do you worry that that just sort of postpones any cyclical recovery in the investor class trading? And then I guess as I corollary to that, could you \u2013 is it possible to sort of pivot towards more the plain vanilla flow businesses that are \u2013 corporate-driven flow businesses that the big universal banks seem to be benefiting from in terms of stability? Is there opportunities set there to kind of crack their market share on those businesses? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I would say with respect to the liquidity dynamic, if I had to rank factors and it's very hard to quantify these things, I would say factors like conviction around the markets because of the sharp decline in the oil price and obviously the negative interest rate environment and the big shift to, as you said, the buy-side holding lots of assets, I think those are as significant a driver in the current environment as is regulation, given that banks are holding less inventory globally. I think that underpinning all of that is that when you look at the client base, regardless of how much velocity may be in their current trading activities quarter-to-quarter, the core needs in terms of their need for liquidity and our desire to provide it, that remains. So I think the core of it is the same. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And do you see any value in trying to sort of capture more market share in the corporate-driven flow business? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The extent to which we can \u2013 sorry, I didn't mean to ignore the last part of your question. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yeah. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think you're right to say that, obviously, the big universal banks, they're two or three times our size, they have a much bigger lending profile and a bigger retail commitment. So they will naturally participate in some flows that, given their size, we won't participate in. But the value is really in servicing the client and so the extent to which we can provide value to a client, obviously, we want to make sure we're doing that. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe just one quick question on M&A activity and capital restructurings in the energy space, it's been a hot topic of whether we see some significant pickup in activity in that space as prices stabilize. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing sort of conversations and potential activity pickup there that we could see later in the year? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we saw, obviously, to the extent to which there were financings in the first quarter, they're obviously energy-related financing activity and we were very involved in that. I would say that, look, the space has been under extreme stress which emerged over a fairly short period of time, measured more in months than years, and so I think our expectation that there will be active dialogue across the industry. Whether or not that manifests itself immediately in the near term, we'll have to see, but obviously the industry is going through quite a bit in this price environment. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for your help. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. On trading broadly, thinking about the importance of hedge funds to your trading business, should we temper our expectations for a bounce back here in your revenues, even if we see some market improvement, given the pressure that that client base has experienced this year? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, look, we think of all of our clients as important, but obviously, we've had a big commitment to the hedge fund industry across equities and fixed them for a long time. We're always rooting for their performance, and so to the extent to which they have improved performance, it may be a catalyst for increased activity. Because in periods like we went through in the first quarter, obviously, they have a tendency to derisk and it reduces trading velocity over many months, although it may be, for example, an active day from time to time. But I think sentiment seems to be improving, but we're going to have to say, as I said before, it's still a little fragile. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, okay, thanks. And then just one more follow-up on the backlog. Could you maybe help us out a little bit on, number one, how we could see \u2013 I think you indicated in the press release that sequentially down quarter-over-quarter on the backlog. But I would have guessed that there might have been maybe some extension from 1Q into 2Q, so could you maybe help me understand that? And then also if you can give any color on some of the deal funding markets and high yield markets and whether there's been some healing and improvement in the backlogs there, given how stressed they were in 1Q? Thanks. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. So, as I mentioned, the backlog was down sequentially, but it's up year-over-year. When you look across the business, the advisory portion of backlog was down versus very strong level at the end of the year, but that's up year-over-year. Versus the end of the year, as we would imagine, given what happened in the equity markets, the equity backlog is up and obviously we had a bit of an outperformance, it looks like, versus the rest of the industry on debt underwriting, and that's down sequentially. In terms of the high yield markets, over the last couple of weeks, still a bit selective, but they seem quite strong, one of the largest transactions was done just last week and so the markets are quite receptive to good solid transactions. Are you there, Brennan? Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Thanks. Appreciate it. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No problem. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Steven. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So, Harvey, I appreciated the color that you've given on some of the factors that were impacting market liquidity, and I know that one of the Fed Governors had recently spoken on the topic and suggested that that reduction in liquidity is a cost worth paying for to help the overall financial system. And given the regulators' willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness, I'm just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management? Have you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think \u2013 look, you have to give the regulators a lot of credit over the last several years for making \u2013 and I'll focus more on the U.S. financial system, including things like CCAR. I think that the safety and soundness of the large U.S. banks and the whole system, they deserve a lot of credit for driving some of that. Obviously, we made a lot of changes to our balance sheet even prior to the regulations, but I think you have to give them a lot of credit for it. I think that all these good benefits which we all benefit from, they come at some marginal cost. It's very hard to measure that marginal cost. I don't know. I have yet to see a very good analysis that breaks down in great detail the impact of negative rates, the fact that we had declining spreads for multiple years that increased asset holdings for mutual funds compared to the shrinkage of bank balance sheets and come up with something that really does a great cost-benefit analysis. I don't think we've seen that. But I think we have to argue the benefits are pretty clear. Now, as it informs our strategy, look, we have an obligation to deliver to our clients and we have an obligation to make sure that we comply with the rules in the way that we can most thoughtfully. And so that's how we approach our strategy. To the extent to which there was demand for the balance sheet and client activity picked up and that demand was accretive to returns, we'd be happy to grow the balance sheet, given the strength of our capital ratios. But we just haven't seen that, so you're not seeing us do this. But over time, the system is going to have to balance liquidity needs and I think that will happen. It just may take a while. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. And I know you touched on some of the emergence of some of the electronic trading platforms. I'm just wondering has that in fact translated into improved liquidity in certain product areas. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think if you go back to history, even ignoring the recent regulatory changes that both clients and market providers participated in, if you go back to some of the formation of Tradeweb back into the early 2000s, I think all of those vehicles, and there may have always been challenges at the start, whether it's TRACE reporting or Tradeweb or things like that. I think over time, those generally have been at the margin, maybe not in all cases, they've contributed to increased liquidity. I think so far the markets have adjusted to things, as I said before, very well and the regulators have done a very good job of introducing swap execution facilities and gradually implementing these things. So I think the extent to which those things have occurred has been helpful. I think where most people talk about liquidity in the marketplace really relates to transacting corporate credit and high yield credit and I don't know of a technological solution that is sort of a cure-all for that. It's all very bespoke and that may be an area that for a while the market struggles with, but not just because of regulation, it's because of all the factors I talked about before. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks, Harvey. And one more just follow-up from me. I was hoping you could actually provide some color, just given the focus in the press on Brexit in terms of how you're thinking about the possible impact on your UK operations and maybe more specifically what strategies you're considering to maybe help mitigate the potential impact. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, obviously, we're paying very close attention to it, whether we're monitoring it from a market and credit risk perspective or from a strategy perspective. As you know, under the framework, as we understand it, it's a multiyear transition to the extent to which Brexit goes under it. But we feel when we look at it, again I want to caveat this given there's a lot of uncertainty \u2013 when we look at it, we feel like in terms of our physical commitment to the region that we're well prepared. But again, there'll be a lot that all of us will learn to the extent to which the referendum goes through on June 23. But that'll be a multiyear process. Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Understood, Harvey. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. First, I want to focus a little bit on Investment Management. Revenue was obviously a bit weaker, as you've described. Guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about the pre-tax margin in that business over the relatively near-term, say the next 12 to 18 months? By my calculation, it's been running in the low 20% range. Do you have designs even in a not so supportive market environment to be able to improve that? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we're obviously always focused on running the business efficiently. We don't target a pre-tax margin for the business. So over time, you may see that move as we're investing in the business, as we're taking on different types of asset pools, but we look at it across the whole business, but we don't target it. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just moving on to capital returns, I notice that you issued some preferreds this quarter. I think in the last CCAR test, your constraining factor, in terms of the stress test at least, was the Tier 1 ratio. The preferred issuance should help you with that. Does that help you in terms of thinking about future capital returns? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The preferred that you saw us do this quarter was the exchange of preferreds. So we were net neutral on the preferreds this quarter. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But you're right to point out that last year \u2013 all the things you point out about last year are accurate. Look, we utilize preferreds to the extent to which they are consistent with our capital plan and our objectives. Generally speaking, as you've heard me say before, we view them as reasonably expensive securities, and so we're not desirous to use them beyond where we think they sort of fit optimally in the capital structure. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly, lastly on energy. It sounded like the vast majority of the increase in the noninvestment grade side was from downgrades. Were there any net draws on the exposure this quarter? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : There were during the quarter. They weren't material, but I don't have that number off the top of my head. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Thanks. Harvey, I just wanted to follow up just a bit on the pipeline issue. Was there any \u2013 particularly on M&A, has there been any pipeline fallout because of change in political circumstances globally or here domestically because of the change in the Treasury's stance on inversion transactions? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, there was one large transaction in the marketplace which looks like in part in response to Treasury actions. It's no longer in the marketplace. We were a participant in that. But I would say that's a minimal factor in the status of the backlog. And so, no, I'd say these are small impacts. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. And so to the extent that macro conditions seem, let's say, broadly unchanged over the past several months, does that continue to support what is generally a very high level of M&A? Or is the tide turning in some way in your view? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So it feels like the fundamental conditions for I'd say an elevated level of M&A activity, they all feel like they're still in place. And those things are challenged top line growth, slow to very moderate GDP growth globally, and so it all feels like it's still in place. Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Devin. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Just want to ask the revenue question maybe another way and maybe from the top down. Just when you think about asset productivity at the firm level or revenues per asset, is it really all about increasing velocity here as client activity hopefully improves? Or are there some things that you can point to around maybe remixing how the balance sheet is weighted over time? I know it's fluid, but just trying to think about the size of really proactive opportunities to improve asset productivity by changing the balance sheet mix outside of just a pickup in client activity? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So we really try never to drive balance sheet to different parts of the firm in a top-down way. It really comes bottom-up, and it comes bottom-up because it's in response to exactly what you're describing. It's client activity. If our bankers need more capital and more liquidity for their clients because they're financing M&A transactions, but we can't \u2013 obviously, from the top, we can't control that from the leadership of the firm. And so it's really in response. So I would say velocity broadly, whether it's in M&A, debt, financing, the ICS businesses, that really is the driving motor for the firm. Obviously, we look to be as thoughtful and efficient about our balance sheet as capital as we can in the context of that, but it really is about velocity and activity levels. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on expenses. As you guys think about just further steps that could be taken from here to reduce expenses if the backdrop remains challenging, I know you're always evaluating those, but are we at a point where the focus is really on reducing costs or maybe the footprint in low return areas that would reduce revenues but they'd still have a positive net impact? Or are there still some costs in the system that can be removed that don't touch revenues? I ask just because you guys have already done so much on this front. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, thanks for acknowledging what we've done over the last couple of years. Look, we're net ROE focused. And net ROE, as I just talked to you about, that's going to be driven in part by client levels of activity. And so, for example, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we go through a firm-wide review of resources, and when you look at that over historical time periods, that's resulted in about a 5% adjustment to resources in the firm. This year as we went through that exercise, parts of the businesses that were more challenged, like fixed income, they elected to take more significant action. And so they would have been greater than 5% during this period. But they're just responding to the market environment and there has been demand for their services in the short run. Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Harvey. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning. Just a quick question on energy or the commodities overall within FICC. I mean, you mentioned during your comments that the client activity was low due to the low energy prices, but I think you then clarified that as saying it was really the drop in energy. I just want to make sure I got that straight and that you can still grow the business even at a low level of energy prices, or was it really just because energy prices are low, revenue is going to be low? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It's great question. It's less the absolute price level; it was more the shock and the nature of the decline. And so when you think about the precipitous nature of the decline and you go through the various client segments, so think about producers responding to that decline in prices and, for example, certainly you didn't see much incremental addition to hedge portfolio activity. On the consumer side, when you get those moves down so quickly, they tend to be a delay until you find some price stability. And for investors, I think the move was so volatile that it was difficult for investors to participate. We've certainly seen some stabilizing in those flows and increased market participation over the last several weeks. But what we saw in the first quarter, really not surprising in terms of client behavior. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just one question. I know before we get into the next quarter's earnings, we'll have the CCAR results, and over the last couple of years you've been, I guess, not shy about using amalgam with regards to CCAR. Can you kind of outlay how you think about capital return as well as whether or not you're going to always be aggressive in your capital ask within the CCAR process? Thanks. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I wouldn't \u2013 just to get a little ticky-tacky on language, I wouldn't that there's a shyness or lack of shyness or aggression or anything like that. We very specifically and carefully go through our capital plan and we ask for what we think is appropriate. And so that's the way I would describe it. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Good morning. I was wondering, if we take as a given that your balance sheet is in pristine condition and that you're the very best, or among the very best in each one of the businesses in which you operate, we run up against a situation that the world has changed dramatically so that we are now nine years into Goldman Sachs not being able to come close to what it did in 2007. Its revenues have been flat-lining for, let's say, five years. Its earnings, pre-tax earnings this year, certainly last year, are half of what you did in 2007. When does Goldman say the time has come for transformational change, that we must do something radically different because we are getting nowhere? We're just treading water for nine years now. The stock is going nowhere. Earnings are going nowhere. Revenues are going nowhere, and yet we are the very best at what we do. When do you start saying we've got to do something radically different? We've got to change? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, I guess, I would say a couple of things. First, Dick, over the last several years, as you pointed out, we've been a $34 billion firm. However, we have changed. During that time period, we sold off $2.5 billion-plus worth of businesses, and we replaced those revenues. You've seen us grow our Asset Management business. Over the time period, when you look at our performance versus the peer group, and I thank you for acknowledging we're the best, we've continued to outperform the peers. We've grown book value. We've returned $25 billion to shareholders over the past four years, and so we have done many things. We can't control what happens in terms of the environment. We don't believe negative interest rates are going to be here forever. We don't believe the client activity is going to be low forever. And you really have to look at this over long periods of time. Look, I will go back to book value, Dick. If you look at it over the past decade, we've grown it by threefold. I think that's contributing value. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: No. I totally agree with you. I don't see anything wrong with Goldman Sachs. I see things wrong with the world and that Goldman Sachs' position in the world is where things are wrong. And what I'm wondering is, when do you think about doing a massive merger of equals? When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you're in now under the understanding that you can't get anything more from what you're doing other than waiting for the tide to come in? In other words, when do you get control of your destiny as opposed to sitting here for nine years, letting the world control where you are and what you're doing? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, again, it's all about language, Dick. I would agree with some of the things you're saying. I certainly wouldn't agree with your statement that we are sitting here, waiting for the world to do what it does. If we felt like there was a client segment or a transaction we could do that would benefit our shareholders, and we could deliver to those clients, we would do it. We're open-minded. There is a reason why we're the leading advisory firm in the world. We would take our own advice, Dick. Richard Bove - Rafferty Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Harvey, we'll go from the strategic to the very tactical of my questions here. We've harped on this in the past on kind of the timing of the comp ratio. Year-over-year the expenses were right in line with revenues. But if you look from sequential, you had a 13% reduction in revenues and a 29% increase in your overall compensation. So that combination really created a squeeze on your returns, which if you would have adjusted for that, would have raised your return on tangible common equity by 1.5 percentage points, 2 percentage points in this particular quarter. So just was curious, in the past, it's worked in your favor. This quarter, it really didn't. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, look, at this stage, it's our best estimate, Marty, in terms of where we think the year will go. Obviously, the performance was challenged in the first quarter and you saw competition of benefit expense come down 40%. It's pretty meaningful. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : No, it was. I am just saying, sequentially the pattern, it just throws you off, and it creates the pressure on returns in a first quarter that's not strong, but weak. Whereas if you were on the average for the year and kept it kind of constant for the average, then you would have a much more kind of just leveled out playing field that we'd just have a dramatic shift between fourth and first quarter. So that's the way... Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I understand your point. It really is our best estimate. We're going to have to see how the year progresses. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Fair. The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer, but it's kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter to quarter. The I&L business gives you increased tangible book value, it has been a contributor, so there's nothing wrong with it, but the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters. What is your just range? And just kind of you're not think out the recession, but just kind of think about it in general, what would be the range of outcomes given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals? And it could be a broad range. I was just kind of thinking when you budget or plan for some normality, what's your kind of aspect to what you think about there? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, when we budget and plan for it, it really is a process through which, because of the nature, again, this is a long-term business, where we're committing long-term capital, it really is done under a very controlled process where the businesses request that capital. As you pointed out, we had roughly $240 million of NII in there. And now the majority of the balance sheet, and this has been in transition over several years, the balance sheet has transitioned more to debt and lending activities, but that is not something, again, that we drove top-down. That was driven by the client demand and the opportunity set. As I said, look, you have to look at this over the long term. As I said earlier, including our first quarter, it's driven $11 billion of revenue over the last eight quarters. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Right. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But you have to look at this at the long term because it's going to be \u2013 it's pro-cyclical and there's going to be volatility quarter to quarter. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then the recent history of zero this quarter to $1 billion would be kind of the range we've been seeing. Is that kind of what you would see? Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I would say that this has been a pretty extreme quarter. You have to go back to the third quarter of 2011 or back to other periods where markets have been extremely volatile to see this kind of performance. But, again, it reinforces what we've told you already, which is, it's price sensitive, it's pro-cyclical and quarter to quarter, you really have to look at it over the long term. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : I got you. And you adjust for those two pieces, you put it to an average in I&L and kind of the average compensation ratio for the year and you're really at 9.5% kind of returns. So that's the benefit you'd have as you kind of roll forward. So, thanks. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, that's your job. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : That's right. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Marty. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Mitchell Schwartz - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, hey, everybody, since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If you have any questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2016 Earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2016. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015.  I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posed on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.  Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the second quarter results, then I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. Net revenues $7.9 billion, net earnings $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share $3.72, and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%. As you all remember, the first quarter of 2016 was dominated by renewed uncertainty regarding the global economic outlook. This impacted prices across various asset classes and drove macro headwinds in each of our businesses. Many of the concerns that existed in the first quarter moderated as we started the second quarter. This was a better environment for our clients and our performance. This was also reflected in equity markets; for example, the S&P 500 was relatively unchanged for most of April and May. In addition, we saw sequential improvements in global investment banking volumes. Activity for the first two months of the quarter was on pace to be up over 20% for equity offerings and nearly 15% for announced M&A however, as we approached June, the market became increasingly focused on Brexit. The focus was on both the economic uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome and the potential economic implications of leaving the EU. These concerns negatively impacted client sentiment, risk appetite and activity levels heading into the vote.  In response to the Leave vote on June 23, market volatility spiked and global equity markets declined significantly, with the MSCI World down roughly 7% in two days. While equity markets largely reversed those losses in the last three days of the quarter, clients and the border marketplace continue to wrestle with the Brexit vote and related uncertainty. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, 22% higher than the first quarter as we saw increased client activity across equity and debt underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased relative to the end of the first quarter and the year ago.  Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $794 million, up 3% from the first quarter. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including NorthStar Asset Management\u2019s $16.9 billion tri-party merger with Colony Capital and NorthStar Realty Finance; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $12.2 billion acquisition of Westar Energy, and Hewlett Packard Enterprises\u2019 $8.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences Corporation.  We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Charter Communications\u2019 $78.7 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and $10.4 billion acquisition of Bright House Networks; Visa Inc.\u2019s \u20ac18.7 billion of Visa Europe, and Airgas Inc.\u2019s $13.4 billion sale to Air Liquide.  Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $993 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially as capital markets activity picked up from the first quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $269 million. This was up significantly compared to weak activity in the first quarter due to an increase in IPOs. Debt underwriting revenues were up 42% to $724 million and benefited from asset-backed issuance and strong leveraged finance activity. During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Mylan\u2019s $6.5 billion investment-grade offering to support its acquisition of Meda AB; U.S. Foods\u2019 $1.2 billion IPO; and the approximately \u20ac850 million IPO of Philips Lighting.  Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter, up 7% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially as market making conditions improved in many businesses from the first quarter. Credit and mortgages increased as the backdrop for providing liquidity was more normalized compared to the first quarter. Rates was also higher sequentially given better market making conditions. Currencies declined relative to solid client activity levels in the first quarter, and commodities declined slightly during the quarter. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.8 billion, down slightly quarter over quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $587 million were up 25% sequentially. Better market making conditions for most of the quarter and select corporate activity drove improved performance. Commissions and fees were $745 million, down 15% quarter over quarter as client activity decreased following heightened volumes in the first quarter. Securities services generated net revenues of $422 million, down 2% relative to the first quarter as seasonally stronger client activity was offset by slightly lower customer balances and spreads. Turning to risk, average daily borrowing in the second quarter was $62 million, down from $72 million in the first quarter. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $626 million primarily reflecting company-specific events, sales, and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $485 million and included more than $250 million of net interest income. In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, consistent with the first quarter. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat sequentially at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision increased $23 billion sequentially to a record $1.31 trillion. The $23 billion increase was substantially driven by $19 billion of net market appreciation. We also had $4 billion of net inflows with $3 billion from liquidity products, and the remainder from long-term fee-based products.  Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year to date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity work and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 42%, consistent with the first half of last year. To respond to the more challenging backdrop, we completed an expense initiative during the first and second quarter. The run rate expense savings will be roughly $700 million. In 2016, these expected savings will be partially offset by severance and other related costs. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter.  Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,800, down 5% from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 26.8%. Our global core of liquid assets ended the second quarter at $211 billion and our balance sheet was $897 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.2% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 13.7% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. All of our capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. This reflects our multi-year effort to de-risk the firm and strengthen our financial profile. Given robust capital ratios, the firm is well positioned to return excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares of common stock for $1.7 billion. For the five quarter CCAR cycle for 2015, we provided shareholders with $6.2 billion in share buybacks and $1.5 billion in common stock dividends. In terms of this year\u2019s CCAR test, we announced that the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan. In conclusion, the first half of 2016 has certainly presented its fair share of challenges and concerns. At the core of these concerns is the outlook for the global economy. As you have heard us state many times before, confidence in economic growth is the most important long-term driver of our business. Confidence incentivizes client activity, which increases demand for our advice, our content and our execution capabilities. While like the rest of the world we would welcome more robust economic growth, ultimately we have to manage the firm for both the current environment and potential future opportunities. How we\u2019ve navigated the difficult environment in the first half of 2016 demonstrates both the strength and resilience of our culture. We remain vigilant regarding our cost structure, our capital usage and our risk profile, and at the same time we have maintained the necessary commitment to ensure that we can meet our clients\u2019 needs as they grow. Being in a position to deliver for our clients and our shareholders requires ongoing investment and a long-term perspective. While we continue to invest in our existing set of businesses, we are also looking for new opportunities. One example is our digital consumer lending platform. While still in its early stages, we expect to begin the initial phase of engaging consumers this fall. As we have discussed with you in the past, we are taking a very deliberate and methodical approach to this effort. We are looking to build a durable business, so it will take time. Similar to our other businesses, creating a valuable and differentiated service for our clients is core to our strategy. In summary, our ability to both react to the current world and simultaneously invest in the future will position the firm to deliver superior value to our clients and our shareholders in the years ahead. Thanks again for dialing in, and I\u2019m happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. A question on comps. It\u2019s always a little touchy, but if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, the ratio is flat with last year but the dollars are down 28% six months year-on-year. So I\u2019m just curious, I know you\u2019ve been remixing a little bit in the employee base. How much of that can help that ratio when you look at it on a full year, and then just how do you balance between a higher ratio versus the 37% you had the last couple of years, three years, and then just having it be a little bit more belt tightening? Harvey Schwartz : So obviously 42 at this stage is our best estimate, but incorporated in that is all the steps that we\u2019re taking. So as I communicated, year-to-date the cost efforts themselves on a run rate basis translate into $700 million of run rate savings. Now, after severance that number is going to be more like 350 this year, but obviously we\u2019re staying very focused on this and I think you see that performance has been down, and with that compensation and benefits expenses down 28% year-to-date. Glenn Schorr : Just so I understand, the\u2014your run rate savings comments - 700, 350 ex-severance, is that in this quarter\u2019s number and therefore just sets a lower bar as we roll through the rest of the year? I just want to make sure what we\u2019re looking at versus what\u2019s on the [indiscernible]. Harvey Schwartz : The way I would think about it is it\u2019s in 2016, and it gives us operating flexibility. But that\u2019s executed - the $700 million is done. Again, that\u2019s run rate, severance costs and other things. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Then your comment on the investment banking pipeline\u2019s down, I\u2019m just curious, how much of that is just off of great numbers and as you execute, including the debt underwriting that you talked about, and then versus how much does Brexit play a role in just kind of slowing things down on deals that might have been happening across Europe? Harvey Schwartz : So when you look at the backlog, I think one way to look at it is the year-over-year, so if you\u2019re actually standing here at the end of June last year, obviously the second quarter and first half of last year were very dynamic. If you look at the backlog in aggregate, it\u2019s sort of down mid-single digits, and so that\u2019s the trajectory of the backlog. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising coming off of high levels - it is where it is. Obviously our market shares have been very significant. In terms of Brexit, where we sit today, given I think that the base case expectation is that the dynamic is going to play out over a long period of time, and in some respects it may contribute to some of the same factors that contributed to a very active M&A environment, other than maybe very specific transactions that are geographic in nature, that are really driven by geography, which is generally few, when we talk to our bankers, if we continue in this low growth environment, they don\u2019t feel sitting here today that Brexit is going to be a headwind but obviously it\u2019s going to be a dynamic situation. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning Christian. How are you? Christian Bolu : Good, good. Thanks for the update on expenses. I might just ask a question, just to try and understand the knock-on impact of Brexit on your cost base. So do you have a sense, a rough sense of what percentage of your revenues and expenses are denominated in pound sterling? I presume you have significant more cost in sterling than revenues, so curious if the decline in the pound could be a further tailwind to expenses in 2H16. Harvey Schwartz : No, it\u2019s not the case necessarily that we have significantly more expenses denominated in sterling. There\u2019s a whole host of processes through which we go through in terms of how employees elect to get compensated, et cetera, so that\u2019s an issue obviously we monitor very closely in terms of our foreign currency risk broadly across the globe, managing a global business, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that as a significant consideration, although it\u2019s a consideration of the many things we look at.  In terms of Brexit, the way I would frame it for you is I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of the near-term observations I can give you and then sort of a longer term perspective. The near-term ones would be just sort of going through the process. Now, obviously we were preparing for Brexit well in advance, even though we all expected it to be a very, very unlikely outcome, but we were significantly prepared for that and that really left us in a position, we feel, to be very front footed with clients. Going into Brexit, client activity tapered off, but at the point of Brexit and potentially thereafter in a number of our businesses, we either near-peak volumes or peak volumes, or new peaks, so that was quite good to see. In terms of the longer term perspective on Brexit, as I said before, this looks like this process is going to take a while, and we\u2019re hopeful, along with everyone else, that the parties that are engaged in these negotiations will be prudent and thoughtful because obviously it\u2019s good for all of us, a thoughtful negotiation and outcome will just be good for economic growth. As it relates to our business, we\u2019ve been in Europe and the U.K. for a very long period of time, and we\u2019re completed committed to our clients in the region, and regardless of how these negotiations go, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re there for them. That would be my broad comment on Brexit. Christian Bolu : Great. Thanks for the detailed response. On debt underwriting, very, very strong numbers and well in excess of what we can see in the kind of public lead tables. So just curious maybe if you can detail some of the growth initiatives around the debt underwriting business and particularly any color on businesses that we would not typically be able to see in the public lead tables. Harvey Schwartz : So one of the drivers in this quarter, as I referenced, was an asset-backed related activity, and there was one significant transaction where earlier on, we had committed capital to purchase a portfolio, which ultimately translated through in the debt underwriting line that would not be included in a lead table, so it\u2019d be difficult for you to see. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Christian. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, how are you? Michael Carrier : Good. First, just on the G-SIB surcharge, just wanted to get an update where you stand, and then probably more importantly when you think of wanting to reduce that versus taking advantage of opportunities to take market share, just given some of the exits that we\u2019ve seen throughout the industry, just want to get a sense on where you\u2019re at and kind of the pullback versus the growth, just given some of the dislocations out there with some of the competitors. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so you\u2019re right - I would summarize it because I think you framed it well. It\u2019s a bit of a balance, and so at this stage we\u2019re at 2.5 on the surcharge. Obviously we\u2019re very focused on reducing our systemic footprint. We believe that and all firms obviously should make that a priority; but you\u2019re right to say that as the competitive environment is shifting and a number of our competitors have stated restructuring plans, we want to make sure that in all of our efforts, whether it\u2019s managing our capital, that we\u2019re focused on costs, that we remain full service across all of our businesses and we\u2019re there for our clients. We believe at this stage we\u2019ve found that balance, and for shareholders it gives them a lot of operating leverage. Michael Carrier : Okay, got it. Just as a follow-up, I guess just two things on the regulatory side. So with CCAR, I know you guys don\u2019t disclose what you\u2019re going to do, but just from a quarter as we kind of go through the third quarter through 2017, should we expect the same type of ramp that we saw last year just in terms of the lighter up front and then the heavier buybacks as that plays out? And then just any update on the\u2014you know, you guys\u2019 capital and funds that would have to be liquidated in 2017? I guess just when you think about those investments, any way for us to gauge where those are marked or where the potential gains could be as those are exited over time? Harvey Schwartz : So what\u2019s expected of CCAR and the CCAR process, obviously you say the 11.1 million shares this quarter and the 1.7 billion-plus in dollar buybacks, so last year\u2019s test had some idiosyncrasies in it which led to this profile where, to the extent of which and we ended up using capacity that we\u2019re repurchasing, that we were more constrained in the early quarters versus the later quarters. And even though we don\u2019t disclose the buyback capacity, and you know we don\u2019t want shareholders to conflate that with dividends, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t, the profile that you would expect this year doesn\u2019t have those idiosyncratic elements to it, so the extent to which we repurchase, it won\u2019t necessarily follow that profile.  In terms of the\u2014I think what you\u2019re asking, the question really relates to the harvesting in the funds. Is that what you\u2019re asking? Michael Carrier : Yes, that\u2019s it. Harvey Schwartz : Okay. So I\u2019ve walked you through that, for lack of better language, that waterfall, so why don\u2019t I just do that. So right now, dollars that are invested predominantly alongside our clients, where we act as a fiduciary, is $7.3 billion. There is $900 million that you would characterize as permitted under the Vogel rule. That leaves us with $6.4 billion. Of the $6.4 billion, $2.1 billion is public; that leaves us with $4.3 billion that is still private sitting alongside those funds. Michael Carrier : Okay. Harvey Schwartz : Actually, I think you asked a question\u2014did you ask a question about - I tried to write them all down. Did you ask a question about how we mark them? Q - Michael Carrier : Well you know, because these would be relatively seasoned. I was just trying to get a sense on based on the investment versus where it is today, is it running at 1.5 times the cost when you invested? Just trying to get a sense of where things are marked in terms of what the potential gain could be. Harvey Schwartz : I understand. Yes, so we mark everything to fair value, so we\u2019re marking it quarter to quarter. So whatever gains or losses that are occurring in those investments, you\u2019re seeing those translate through every quarter. Michael Carrier : Got it, okay, but we don\u2019t have a cost base versus a fair value, meaning to\u2014 Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s across multiple funds, and so I don\u2019t have an aggregate number for you on that. Michael Carrier : Okay, all right. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : The funds have obviously performed well - you\u2019ve seen that translate through the performance over the last couple years. Michael Carrier : Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Matt, how are you? Matt O\u2019Connor: Good, thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about investment management in terms of why the fees were so weak there, say, versus a year ago? I realize a lot of it is the incentive fees, which tend to be lumpy, but even the other, call it more [indiscernible] like fees were sluggish. Is there something on the timing of when you collect, say, versus equity prices and the volatility there, or is there something else going on? Harvey Schwartz : So the biggest driver in the quarter when you look year-over-year is obviously the incentive fees, and that\u2019s reflective of the environment and incentive fees from time to time are going to be lumpy. With respect to the management and other fees, it really is just about mix and the average fee coming down, although offset in part by the fact that obviously [indiscernible] has grown pretty significantly year over year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, and I guess what exactly is the negative mix shift? I mean, obviously liquidity under supervision has increased, but it seems like the overall balances for equity and fixed income really across the board, it seems like the balances have increased. When you talk about the mix shift, what exactly is that? Harvey Schwartz : So as you know, in the business obviously we have a number of different client segments so it\u2019s full service across a number of different lines. One of those lines is large advisory institutional mandates. Those mandates, given their size, tend to come at a lower fee base, and so that\u2019s really the mix shift. So it\u2019s basically away from classic mutual funds and into those types of mandates. You can see\u2014I think we break it out for you in the 10-Q, you can see all that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Then just separately on the bank initiative, you did mention about rolling out the digital consumer lending platform in the fall. But just more broadly speaking, maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall, and then on the deposit side as well, I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so by view of the separate banks, this one\u2019s really about liability management. Are you talking about the GE deposit acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re asking about in terms of the brand acquisition? Is that what you\u2019re talking about? Matt O\u2019Connor: Correct. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, okay, so why don\u2019t I just start there and I\u2019ll take your question in reverse. So we view those\u2014obviously that\u2019s separate in terms of\u2014obviously we view asset liability management as an integrated exercise, but those two efforts are separate. But having said that, the acquisition went quite well, added in excess of $15 billion of deposits to the firm. It\u2019s great for us because it diversifies our sources of funding, which as you know we\u2019re always looking to do. Since the acquisition date, it\u2019s been well received by consumers - we\u2019ve had in excess of 20,000 consumers open up new accounts for us, so it\u2019s had very significant growth in a short period of time. So it really speaks to the brand strength, which has been very nice to see. Now in terms of the longer term objectives, maybe I\u2019ll just take an opportunity to level set you on where we are in the online lending. So as we talked about, we hired Harit over a year ago and he\u2019s been a fantastic addition to the team, and he\u2019s built a very capable team over that period of time. So I think it\u2019s probably important just to level set you on how we approach this process. So we\u2019ve obviously keenly aware of the fact that this is a new business opportunity for us and, importantly, a new client base, so one of the things we did is we reached out to thousands of consumers to really understand what they want and their borrowing priorities. Through that, we learned some things that probably aren\u2019t so surprising - they want a product that\u2019s simple, it\u2019s straightforward, it provides a lot of value, and they also want what they refer to as really a high quality user experience. So what we have attempted to do is take all this feedback, we developed one product. I\u2019ve emphasized\u2014you know, we\u2019ve emphasized a number of times that we\u2019re going to be very deliberate and slow with this, so we\u2019ve developed one product which we plan to launch later this fall, so that\u2019s where we stand [indiscernible] over the next several months. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, and sorry - what is that one product? Is it an unsecured loan, or what\u2019s the\u2014 Harvey Schwartz : Yes, it\u2019s an unsecured consumer loan product. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Would they ask\u2014I mean, target a customer of kind of short duration, small loan size, bigger loan size? What\u2019s kind of the\u2014 Harvey Schwartz : We\u2019ll come back with all those details in the fall. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, fair enough. Okay, thanks for all the answers. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. So headcount was down a lot just over three months, I guess down 5%. Is that right? Harvey Schwartz : That\u2019s correct. Mike Mayo : So where were those\u2014where did those headcount reductions occur? Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of the headcount process, the process itself really started back in February in terms of our analytics. Now as you know, Mike, we go through\u2014what gets a lot of attention is that we referred to it as a review of the 5%. In years, it varies. Sometimes those reviews yield small reductions, sometimes we actually add people. It varied by business. Obviously for businesses that have hit heavier headwinds, like fixed income, they elected to go beyond the 5% in terms of their exercise, and then there are supporting businesses that are adjacent there, so things like ops and tech. This is a broad exercise across the firm. Now, I would point out again that this is netted against hiring, so we\u2019re still hiring, and so\u2014but the 5%, as I pointed out, on a run rate basis it\u2019s $700 million. Mike Mayo : I\u2019m sorry - what\u2019s $700 million? Harvey Schwartz : $700 million is the cost savings on a run rate basis associated with that exercise. Mike Mayo : And that\u2019s not reflected in the second quarter? Harvey Schwartz : It is reflected in the quarter to the extent to which it\u2019s reflected in our compensation accrual, which is our best estimate for the year. Mike Mayo : Okay, so what was the gross headcount reduction? Net is 5%, before the hiring, was it 6 or 7%? Harvey Schwartz : The biggest addition offsetting that would have been, for example, roughly 600 new analysts that joined the firm in June. Mike Mayo : That\u2019s a really big headcount reduction in just three months. How do you know that you did it correctly? I mean, did you cut into muscle, did you cut fat? Harvey Schwartz : You know, it\u2019s interesting. We, as you know, like sometimes\u2014sometimes I think that because we don\u2019t announce targets in advance, that people misunderstand a bit about the way we run the business. So we view this as a very thoughtful exercise. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve sacrificed any optionality. We certainly have not sacrificed any commitment to our clients. These exercises are done at the business level and built up from the business level. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : I just wanted to return first of all to the capital management question and maybe ask it a little bit differently in terms of what we might expect over the next several quarters. So you bumped up the buyback to $1.7 billion, the diluted share count fell by about 2% in the quarter. If you annualize, then you\u2019re two or three percentage points ahead of what the kind of last five years\u2019 run rate has been in terms of how you\u2019ve reduced the diluted share count. So in the absence of a specific guide post-CCAR, what should we be thinking about in terms of that attempt to reduce the share count? Should we be thinking in terms of that 5% run rate, or maybe a couple of percentage points higher in line with what you\u2019ve done recently? Harvey Schwartz : I think the reluctance for me to be more specific in terms of guiding you really reflects the dynamic nature of how we do it. So you have to think about\u2014and it\u2019s obviously more complicated than this, but you have to think about the three competing factors that we\u2019re always managing. The first and most important is that we put ourselves in a very strong financial position so that we\u2019re there for our clients, so if we saw a big uptick in client demand for our capital, we would be very happy to deploy that capital and actually not return it to shareholders. So this really reflects the fact that the client demand of a period of time hasn\u2019t been there. Now, the second things we do and the strength of the financial footings of the firm, obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a huge amount of work and you see it reflected in our ratios with 13.7 standardized at the end of this quarter. Obviously we\u2019ve been very focused on how we\u2019ve been de-risking the firm and deploying that capital when demanded for us. Ultimately, that gives you the flexibility to either return it or not, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen the uptick over the past couple of years in terms of levels of activity. But the average diluted share count, as you pointed, is at a low level. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, that\u2019s actually useful in terms of understanding your overall framework, so thanks for that. This actually turns out to be a related question - you caveated in the release that the environment for FICC continues to be pretty challenging because of low rates and volumes and low client activity, which implies that there is a more normal run rate that you think is achievable. Can you give us a sense of what that might be, and does that take into account revenue pressures from shifts to electronic trading as well as alternatively the potential to gain share from global competitors who may be retrenching? Harvey Schwartz : So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on that. You know, Guy, I\u2019d say that first in terms of client activity levels and run rate, if you will, run rate is a difficult thing but I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree that when you look at the trading activity levels and the industry trends over the last couple years, obviously they\u2019ve been in decline. When you look at the factors in terms of our clients and what they need, our clients are still there and they still need those services, they need them from us, and so the type of environment we\u2019ve been in, if you actually look at the sort of\u2014for lack of better language, the violence of the first quarter in January and February, and then the concerns about Brexit in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s fair for us to say these feel like low levels\u2014these are the type of factors that contribute to reduced client sentiment, reduced confidence, and as a result reduced activity. Now, one interesting takeaway, and we\u2019ve seen this before sporadically, is after Brexit when volumes were much higher for those couple of days, in all the things that we watch, we could see a demonstrable uptick in our market shares. That may be the result of the current competitive environment as we\u2019ve talked about a number of the global competitors are going through restructurings, they\u2019ve been quite challenged. So when volumes pick up, we feel like we see it, but it\u2019s difficult for me to tell you what the run rate will be over a long period of time, given the dynamic nature of markets and the unique place we find ourselves with respect to global growth and interest rates. Guy Moszkowski : So can you elaborate a little bit on those metrics, even though I recognize it was just for a short period of time, but the metrics that told you that you were picking up market share, because up until now when we\u2019ve asked you that question, you\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s still hard to measure, it\u2019s early days, you\u2019re not really going to be able to tell in this kind of environment. But you sound much more concrete about it now. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. One of the things that we\u2019re able to do over time, given all of the public regulatory reporting, is we\u2019re able to monitor those things more closely in fixed income than historically exists, and obviously you have exchanges that you can monitor. Exchange volumes are not necessarily the greatest indicator, but over long periods of time you can see it, or under unique circumstances when you get big spikes in activity. But it feels like it to us, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Fiona Swaffield : Hi, I have questions in two areas. Firstly, I think you made some comments about security services and margins and volumes being somewhat down. I wonder if you could go into that in more detail, and are we\u2014historically we\u2019ve seen wider spreads, this is kind of a real change in trend. The second question was on your clients. In a recent presentation, Goldman talked about a mix shift in clients, or stronger growth among some clients versus others over 2015, going back. I mean, has there been a continued shift change if you looked at the client mix in 2016? Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, thanks Fiona. So with respect to [indiscernible] client services, that\u2019s just reflective of activity levels, and as markets were volatile in the first and second quarter, you saw that translate through with respect to demand, market prices and spreads, so there\u2019s nothing really to highlight there other than its reflective of the environment. In terms of the client base and our client footings, we\u2019re always looking to grow our market share across all segments, across all regions, and so we continue to focus on that and there\u2019s always things we can do better.  Thanks Fiona. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein : Yes, hi. First question\u2014 Harvey Schwartz : Kian, are you there? Kian, I think we lost you. I don\u2019t know if you can hear us. Operator : Kian, maybe your line has been placed on mute? Okay, we\u2019ll move onto the next question, and that\u2019s from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Just a couple of quick small questions. On FICC, you guys mentioned that mortgages were down significantly. None of your peers really talked about that. Is there anything unusual there for you guys in mortgage that hurt you in the quarter? Harvey Schwartz : No, I think that\u2019s maybe just reflective of different product lines that businesses may have. We\u2019re not as big in things like credit cards and other parts of things which may flow through those business lines. I don\u2019t really have the visibility into the competitor base well enough to tell you. Jim Mitchell : But why was mortgages so much weaker than a year ago? I\u2019m just trying to think through the dynamic there this quarter. Harvey Schwartz : Client activities and inventory, in terms of the way it moved year over year. Jim Mitchell : Right, okay. Maybe I missed it - did you give us the fully phased in ratios? Harvey Schwartz : No, I didn\u2019t. So you want me to [indiscernible] for you, so just to recap again, I\u2019ll start with the advanced. Transitional 12 :2, the fully phased is 11 :8, standardized 13 :7, fully phased 13 :1. Jim Mitchell : Okay, so those gaps are closing as you kind of sell down the private equity, so that\u2019s progressing nicely. Okay, great. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Welcome back, Kian. Kian Abouhossein : Yes, sorry. I got disconnected somehow. Just briefly on Brexit, and I really have two questions. The first one is related to clearly we had the sell-off, high volatility, a lot of transaction volumes as you indicated in FX, et cetera. Historically after such an environment, we\u2019ve seen more of a dry-up of the business. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing, or do you see more seasonal adjustments to the business as you see in normal times, or is there a more pronounced adjustment to the business environment transaction volumes is getting a bit lower than usual what you would expect? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, I think that\u2019s a reasonable question in terms of just the unique nature of Brexit. It\u2019s interesting how the world\u2014so the market reaction, the activity level right around Brexit obviously I don\u2019t think was surprising to any of us. I think you could have sat there those couple days after Brexit and if you were forecasting the next month of activity, I think you might have been surprised if we could have known in advance that equity markets would rebound so strongly, there would be a rebound in currencies, and the world would sort of normalize. I think that may be a little bit different, to go back to the core of your question about things we\u2019ve seen in the past, so this normalization was so quick that it actually may be something that\u2019s a better harbinger in the near term usually following one of these events for activity levels. I can frame that for you in a bit more detail. So I talked about the merger business earlier. If we stay in this low growth environment, unless something is really uniquely impacted by Brexit and if the negotiation process takes a long period of time, then as I said, our bankers don\u2019t necessarily see this being a headwind. If we stay in this low interest rate environment and you take a look at our asset management business, then this is really an environment where clients need advice, and that also translates into our ITS business. This is a very content-rich environment now and markets have stabilized so quickly, whether it\u2019s debt or equity, et cetera, that I don\u2019t know if I would have guessed a couple of weeks ago that the market would have rebounded so quickly, but it feels pretty normalized for now. Kian Abouhossein : The [indiscernible] that you underlined, do you see that already so far planning out? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I think there would have been a lot of questions a few weeks ago about the cross-border mergers, for example, into the U.K., and obviously we\u2019ve seen that within two weeks, so I think there\u2019s evidence. Kian Abouhossein : Okay. The second question on Brexit is I think there was an earlier question about the impact of Brexit on you, but clearly there\u2019s this issue of EU passporting and there\u2019s clearly the potential of using [indiscernible] Article 4647 assuming there is no EU passporting. Is that something that you feel as a European player sitting in the U.K. you would be able to use to your benefit, or is that not strong enough of a regulatory setting in order to operate out of the U.K.? Harvey Schwartz : I think the answer is it\u2019s just too early to tell in terms of how this process was going to unfold. Again as I said earlier, like everyone else, yourself included, we\u2019re hopeful that this is a really thoughtful and prudent process, but it really is a question\u2014you know, we\u2019re contingency planners and so we\u2019ll contingency plan for multiple outcomes, but way too early to speak specifically. Kian Abouhossein : Okay, thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Kian. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Thanks, good morning. How are you doing, Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Good. Brennan Hawken : A quick one on NII. I think when you were walking through INL, you said that NII was around $250 million or so, so if we\u2019re run rating that at about $1 billion, when we look at your INL balance sheet in the Q and just using the last quarter\u2019s numbers because I doubt they\u2019re that different, if we sum up the debt and loans, you get to about $70 billion or so, just over, which is a little over a 1% net yield. Is it that funding costs for that portfolio are really high? What causes that, or is it that the asset yields are low? What causes that yield to seem a bit low to folks? Harvey Schwartz : So that\u2019s a good question. So let\u2019s start with\u2014why don\u2019t I just level set you on the balance sheet, the INL balance sheet first. So you were very accurate in your high level commentary, but the balance sheet is down roughly $2 billion quarter over quarter, down to 97.1, and that breaks out between roughly $20.8 billion of what we call equity, and of that $3.5 billion is public equity and the total $16.8 billion of corporate equity, and then the rest, as you said, is debt. With respect to the NIM, in part it has to do with deposits but for the most part it has to do with the quality of the portfolio. So as you know, a large portion of the portfolio is collateralized, so it\u2019s just less risky. Brennan Hawken : So it\u2019s more on the asset side rather than on the funding side. Harvey Schwartz : It\u2019s a mix. We don\u2019t have branches all over the United States, so we don\u2019t have the lowest marginal cost of funding in terms of deposits, but it really is more of the collateralized nature of the lending that we\u2019re doing. Brennan Hawken : Got it, that helps. Thanks Harvey. Then one question on capital post-CCAR here. We in the past have gotten the dividend increase in the first quarter for you guys post-CCAR. I believe you mentioned in your press release post-CCAR that you were approved for a dividend hike, so was the difference this year just around timing with the Board not having time to meet before the third quarter dividend got announced, or should we think about this CCAR year differently than past years? Harvey Schwartz : I think what we intended to communicate was that the approval gave us the flexibility to do all those things, but we weren\u2019t speaking specifically to any decision making with respect to the dividend. The way we\u2014as you know, our preferred methodology, because it gives us a lot more flexibility internally how we manage our capital, is to provide capital return to shareholders, but there\u2019s nothing specific or you shouldn\u2019t interpret anything as a takeaway year to year as we think about the dividend. Those will be discrete decisions that we make as we think through the capital planning process. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Morning Steven. How are you? Steven Chubak : Well, thanks. So Harvey, first question I have is on CCAR. You noted in the past that CCAR is the firm\u2019s binding constraint on capital, and I\u2019m just wondering whether the favorable result in the latest exam positions you to maybe attribute or allocate less capital to market making activities; or said a bit differently, does it enable you to be more competitive on pricing assuming that your attributable equity has come down? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so it\u2019s an interesting question. I guess you could say CCAR is binding if you ask of capital return and you have to revise it. That\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019ve meant to communicate. Obviously if you just looked at our headline ratios at 13 :7 and 12 :2, we have significant excess capital relative to the required regulatory minimum. It\u2019s a dynamic process for us, and so in this particular year the Federal Reserve\u2019s interpretation of their scenario was more favorable than our interpretation of the scenario, but it\u2019s our interpretation of the scenario that\u2019s going to govern our capital policy and how we think about capital management, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ll approach it. It\u2019s our test. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. So in thinking about capital allocation, should we look at your own submission as a way to infer how much capital you\u2019re allocating for certain activities, or is that not reasonable? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, except for the fact that\u2014the one thing I would say is that the capital allocation process itself, and now we\u2019re talking about operating principles, we\u2019re not talking about tests, the operating principles, we design the firm, we manage the firm to be very flexible. So if there is client demand for capital in investment banking, we want to be in a position to deploy that. If there\u2019s client demand for capital\u2014because the vast majority of our capital is high velocity. If there are opportunities and client demand in investing and lending, which tend to be longer term commitments of capital, obviously we engage in those also, but we don\u2019t allocate down a capital in a way that says, okay, here\u2019s your capital Mr. and Mrs. Business, you use that, we\u2019ll see you in a year. We feel like we get a much better ability to deliver to our clients globally if we can be more flexible and dynamic with it. Steven Chubak : Right, thanks Harvey. Just one more follow-up from me. There was a senior regulator who recently made remarks suggesting that they could impose some tougher capital requirements for activities specifically in the physical commodities space. I know that\u2019s been debated for some time, but do you have any sense as to what form that proposal might take and whether it could compel any changes in terms of how you strategically manage that business? Harvey Schwartz : No, we\u2019ll have to see what the rule comes out with. The vast majority of our business, as you know, is not unlike a lot of the other capital markets businesses where we\u2019re working with corporate clients on hedging their exposures, we\u2019re working with investors who want access to the commodity markets. So commodity hedging for a consumer or a producer of a commodity, to them it\u2019s no different than the way a corporate would hedge foreign exchange.  We\u2019ll have to see what ultimately the rules look like, but obviously we\u2019re very committed to those clients. Steven Chubak : Thanks Harvey. Do you have any sense as to timing as to when we\u2019ll get clarity on that rule? Harvey Schwartz : No, I only have the same information you have. Steven Chubak : Fair enough. All right, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, in terms of the additional global core liquidity you had on the balance sheet at both the end of the quarter and for the average of the quarter, that was up a bit from last quarter. Is that primarily due to the GE deposits, or is there something else going on there? Harvey Schwartz : No, that\u2019s correct. We took in $16 billion roughly of deposits, and that\u2019s really the whole driver of the increase, both in the balance sheet and in the GCLA. Matt Burnell : Okay, fair enough. Then just in terms of the backlog decline both sequentially and year over year, is there any specific geography - you know, Asia, Europe, North AmericA - that is meaningfully stronger or weaker within that trend? Harvey Schwartz : No, not necessarily. Matt Burnell : Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Harvey, just to circle back to the expense commentary for a moment, would it be your expectation that the actions you\u2019ve taken will allow you to generate positive operating leverage, or maybe just more broadly, what is your expectation about operating leverage for the back half of this year? Harvey Schwartz : Look, you\u2019ve seen it - it seems like ages ago now, but in the first quarter of 2015, we had an improved market environment, we were very quickly able to deliver lots of operating leverage, and you saw a near 15% ROE in that quarter. Like I said, it feels like a long time ago now. We continually review all the businesses to ensure that we\u2019re maintaining the right footprint, so this is all about making sure that we find the right balance between our commitment to clients over the long term and expense management, and obviously the first half of this year has not been the greatest environment, so you\u2019re just seeing us respond to it. Eric Wasserstrom : Can you just help me understand - when you say $700 million of run rate savings, from what level and under what revenue circumstances? Harvey Schwartz : So the way to think about that is, if we finish the end of the 2015 with a certain [indiscernible], all those adjustments and resources on a run rate basis would be $700 million, so all other factors being equal. But that won\u2019t translate into this year because there are severance and other related costs, and net of that will be something more like 350, so you should really think of that as translating into 2017. Now, this will be dynamic of course because we\u2019ll be hiring more people, so you and I are really sterilizing the discussion for this number, but I think that\u2019s the best way to explain it to you. Eric Wasserstrom : It sounds like you think that the actions you\u2019ve taken are sufficient to address this current revenue circumstance, but what would cause you perhaps reconsider and make additional adjustments? Harvey Schwartz : Well certainly if the environment continued to be challenged, we would continue to refine the businesses. On the flipside, if the environment globally improved dramatically and there was a real demand for our resources, which has been no difficulty in attracting very, very high quality talent to the firm, so we\u2019re also being very thoughtful about giving people an opportunity to want to be at Goldman Sachs that we want to be here. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Then just one quick accounting question. I think last quarter you indicated that your expected tax rate for the full year would be around 31%. Has that changed at all, given the second quarter\u2019s figure? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, given where we\u2019re running now, I would say something just shy of 30 feels like a better expectation where we stand right now. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey, good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Devin. Devin Ryan : I appreciate the update on the digital consumer finance business initiative, understand the current view that this is going to be a slow build. It sounds like it could take some time to really move the needle under the current path, but is there a case for buying something to enhance either the lending capabilities or liability gathering, just so that you get to that critical mass more quickly, or just thinking about the strategy, is it just kind of by its nature it needs to be built up organically, just so that it\u2019s a differentiated platform? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So obviously you\u2019ve seen us do a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions in IMD, and the thesis behind those, because we\u2019re certainly not reluctant to do that, is when we feel like we had a capability that we would\u2014if there\u2019s a service we\u2019d like to enhance for our clients or a capability that we\u2019re quite good at, that we think we can add scale to, we\u2019ll just weigh the costs and benefits of acquiring versus building in-house.  This particular effort, when we looked at it, we really felt like best designed from scratch, and the reason for that is I think we\u2019re kind of uniquely positioned. It allows us to leverage our technology skills and our risk skills, but this is really about if you look at sort of the competitive landscape, there are benefits that online lending platforms provide to consumers and there are benefits that large commercial providers of credit provide to consumers. We\u2019re just really looking to bridge the gap between those strengths and offer consumers as best we can a really thoughtful and differentiated product. Devin Ryan : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Separately, just love some thoughts about how you guys are thinking about the upcoming election just as an influence on business, either from a client perspective or even how you\u2019re thinking about planning in your business. There\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric just around some pretty bold proposals recently, reinstating Glass-Steagall, for example in financials, some similar kind of bold themes in other sectors. I\u2019m just curious how much is this uncertainty into the election delaying decision-making, if at all, or keeping a lid on client activity. Harvey Schwartz : Look, I think this cycle will have its unique aspects to it versus other presidential cycles, but historically there\u2019s always been some element which may have ultimately deferred a decision that a client might make to a later period. But these are short term in nature, so we don\u2019t see any significant impact in terms of the near term. Devin Ryan : Got it, okay. Just last one quickly - the decline in VAR, I know that can bounce around, but was that just de-risking into the U.K. referendum or just the reduced volatility? Just curious what drove that - it was at the lowest level in quite some time. Harvey Schwartz : It was a combination. Obviously the VAR declined pretty meaningfully in average over the quarter. Really, that was a combination of two factors. There was reduced client activity going into Brexit, and as I mentioned earlier, we were being pretty prudent as we approached the date. Devin Ryan : Understood, got it. Thanks Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Harvey, I wanted to go back into the CCAR and think about adjustments on operational risk. Like we had talked about, there had been some double counting. You did get a benefit of 250 basis points, so to speak, in your minimum ratios going higher. Is that\u2014you know, as we talked about double counting and SIFI possibly going into CCAR, it looks like you got a break on operational risk that almost equals your SIFI charge almost exactly. Harvey Schwartz : We don\u2019t have any visibility into those calculations, Marty. As you know, there\u2019s no transparency in that process, so I really can\u2019t comment. I think this year\u2019s test and last year\u2019s test and the year prior to that, I think it just confirms what the Federal Reserve has been very clear about. Their test is going to be dynamic from year to year. They\u2019re going to incorporate lots of different variables - that\u2019s how they designed it, so I actually think they\u2019re just fulfilling their design criteria. Marty Mosby : The other thing I was going to ask you was on this quarter and the headcount reductions, where the severance costs would probably hit, when you look at kind of dividing it, if you just said well, you\u2019re at full run rate in the second quarter, which I know you probably weren\u2019t, but $175 million per quarter, and then you look at the net for the year you\u2019re talking about for this year of being 350 net severance then being possible $350 million, I was trying to think of the timing in relation to the gains in the sense of the expense savings and how that might have affected the second quarter. Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so the way to think about it is on an annualized basis, Marty, so you should incorporate those numbers as $700 million on a run rate basis, that run rate basis\u2014and this is again a very sterilized way we\u2019re doing this conversation. That\u2019s all other factors being equal going into 2017, and this year that will translate roughly into $350 million of savings this year. How that flows through quarter to quarter, that\u2019s very specific to a number of circumstances. Marty Mosby : Would it be safe to say that a majority of the severance was going to be at least in the second quarter? Harvey Schwartz : Some, but not all. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had a quick question on the Volcker investments. I know you said previously that there is a chance that it could get extended as you get into 2017, but there\u2019s really been no discussion as far as I\u2019ve seen with regards to that. So how should we think about those Volcker investments over the course of next year? Is it really just some type of liquidity event in 2Q17 that will become or happen because if there is no extension or you\u2019re just going to take a wait-and-see approach on winding those down? Harvey Schwartz : So as I mentioned before, we have $4.3 billion that\u2019s private, $2.1 billion\u2014I went through the waterfall, so I won\u2019t do it again. You would have seen a communication from the regulators that basically spoke to the confirmation of the extension to 2017, and then there\u2019s been public submissions in terms of industry-wide requests for incremental extensions, which I believe under the Volcker interpretations can be as much as an incremental five years.  If you remember, if you go back to the genesis of Volcker, it wasn\u2019t designed to force fire sales or anything like that, so the industry again has been working with the regulators through various bodies, and we\u2019ll see how the regulators finally respond to that. But I think the industry has done a good job, as have we, of bringing down these levels, but we\u2019re sitting alongside our clients mostly in these funds, so we don\u2019t have unilateral authority just to sell these assets. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, good. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : That\u2019s great. Since there aren\u2019t any more questions, we just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Hopefully we\u2019ll all get to see you over the course of the coming months. If you have any other questions, give a call into Dane and the team; but otherwise thanks again for participating and have a great summer. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2016. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, will now review the firm's results. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the third quarter and year-to-date results and am happy to answer any questions. Net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings $2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share $4.88 and our annualized return on common equity was 11.2%. For the year-to-date, net revenues were $22.4 billion, net earnings $5.1 billion, earnings per diluted share $11.24 and our annualized return on common equity was 8.7%. Relative to the first quarter of this year, the second and now the third quarter, have shown steady improvement. This improvement is reflected in third-quarter revenues, which increased 19% year-over-year. We also had a modest sequential increase which is particularly noteworthy given the third quarter is often seasonally slower. A few factors contributed to the enhanced operating environment. The markets generally improved with equity prices steadily moving higher. The S&P 500 was up 3.3% in the third quarter. The MSCI World increased by 4.8% and the VIX declined by 15%. Credit spreads also tightened during the quarter with U.S. investment grade and high yield cash spreads tighter by 12 basis points and 87 basis points respectively. In addition, there weren't any major changes to the global economic outlook over the course of the quarter. For example consensus estimates for global GDP growth remained roughly consistent. Ultimately a more favorable backdrop and improved client sentiment translated into year-over-year revenue growth in three of our four business segments. Now let's discuss them. Investment banking produced third quarter revenues of $1.5 billion, 14% lower than a strong second quarter. Although revenues declined sequentially, our investment banking backlog remained robust and was up versus last quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the quarter, advisory revenues were $658 million down 17% compared to the second quarter as industry-wide completed activity declined. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter, including ARM holdings \u00a324.4 billion sale to Softbank Group. AGL Resources $12 billion merger with Southern Company and Lockheed Martin's $5 billion spinoff and merger of its IS&GS business into Leidos. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter, including WhiteWave Foods $12.5 billion sale to Group Danone. Hewlett-Packard Enterprises' $8.8 billion spin off and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International and Abbott Medical Optics' $4.3 billion sale to Johnson & Johnson. Moving down to revenue, revenues were $879 million in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially, due to a decline in both debt and equity underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $227 million down 16% compared to the second quarter due to a continued weak backdrop for equity issuance. However the end of the quarter was significantly more active in the beginning with more than half of the quarter's IPO volume occurring in September. Debt underwriting revenues of $652 million were down 10% quarter-over-quarter, following a robust second quarter. For the first nine months of the year debt amortizing produced record year-to-date results. During the third quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs, participating in Postal Savings Bank of China's $7.4 billion IPO, Great Plains Energy's $2.5 billion follow-on and convertible offering to support its purchase of Westar and Fortis' $2 billion investment grade offering for the purchase of ITC. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter up 2%compared to the second quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the third quarter up 2% sequentially. Credit increased and benefited from strong primary issuance and tighter spreads. Mortgage also increased and included better market-making conditions even tighter spreads. Rates was down slightly as client activity was driven by the continued discussion around potential Central Bank actions. Currencies was essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter with lower client activity, particularly post the Brexit vote and commodities declined during the quarter as activity remained light. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Equities client execution net revenues of $678 million were up 16% sequentially, reflecting better market-making conditions. Commissions and fees were $719 million, down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Security services generated net revenues of $387 million down 8% relative to the seasonally stronger second quarter. Turning to risk, average daily volume in the third quarter declined to $57 million, down $5 million sequentially. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $920 million, reflecting company-specific events, sale and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $478 million and included approximately $275 million of net interest income. Investment management we reported third-quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion up 10% from the second quarter as incentive fees, management fees and transaction revenues all increased. Assets under supervision increased $37 billion sequentially to a record $1.35 trillion. The increase was due to net market appreciation and net inflows. Long-term fee-based net inflows of $14 billion were primarily driven by fixed-income products. Now let me turn to expenses, year-to-date compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior your equity awards and other items such as benefits declined by 13%. This was roughly in line with net revenues. The 13% year-to-date decline results in a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is a hundred basis points lower in the funds accrual in the first half of this year. Third-quarter noncompetition expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly compared to the second quarter. Now I would like to take you through a few key statistics. Total staff was approximately 34,900 roughly flat with the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 26.9%. Our global core liquid asset ended the third quarter at $214 billion and our balance sheet was $880 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14% using the standardized approach. It was 12.4% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. In the quarter we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1.3 billion. In terms of capital, our ratios have significantly strengthened over the last several years. This reflects the transformation of our balance sheet and our cumulative effort to de-risk the firm. All of these actions, combined with more than $30 billion of earnings since 2011, position the firm to grow our capital ratios and simultaneously bring our basic share count to its lowest point ever. Before I wrap up, I want to cover three topics, our client franchise, expense initiatives and new opportunities. With respect to global client franchise, it's in great shape. We have a strong position in each of our four segments, investment banking, institutional client services, investing in lending and investment management. While many of our clients are currently challenged by the low growth environment, we are committed to partnering with them and they look to navigate these headwinds. On expenses, last quarter we discussed the $700 million savings initiative that we undertook in the first half of the year and we continue to look at additional means of improving our efficiency without impacting our global client franchise. Focusing on operating efficiency, not only positions us for margin expansion in better environments, but it also provides additional benefits. It allows the firm to maintain its global footprint and to continue to invest in the future, which is an essential component of sustainable value creation. While there are currently economic headwinds in several countries globally, our focus on efficiency across all of our businesses and regions allows the firm not only to maintain, but also to invest in our client franchise through the cycle. Additionally, our expense discipline allows us to invest in new opportunities. Last week we launched a new online personal loan platform Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Marcus' goal is to enter the consumer credit market and provide a product that is simple, transparent, flexible and provides consumers with real value. Like any new effort, we are taking a slow and methodical approach with Marcus. We are leveraging all the firm's pre-existing strengths across risk management and technology and we have brought an experienced team of consumer lending professionals to drive Marcus forward led by Harit Talwar. Before taking your questions, I would like to leave you with one thought. The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment, as we are on preparing for the future. You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter. Thanks again for dialing in and I am happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : So I appreciate the color around things related to FICC and I've a question of overall backdrop. In the first quarter of '15, the Swiss re-pegged stuff went bonkers for a couple weeks and you made tons of money even more than the overall industry. This quarter it didn't seem like there was too many aha moment. Credit spreads tightened and they had aftermath of Brexit and stuff, but in your text you point out low rates and slow economic growth as headwinds for FICC. You talk about lower market firms and volatility and equities. I'm just curious when you look at the quarter we just had in FICC particularly, is it more like you had a nice pickup like first quarter of '15 and you're setting this up for keep calm like things have returned back to normal or is this possibly a little bit higher activity environment given the uncertainty? Harvey Schwartz : So it's a great question, year-over-year we were up 49% on a core basis. I think in some respects that speaks to a weaker third quarter environment last year, but I have to agree with you. I wouldn't say it was a particularly strong quarter for FICC. Year-over-year I talked about some of the drivers. I would say maybe the best way to describe, it wasn't so much -- it wasn't so much about tailwind as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter and of course we translated nicely for us. Glenn Schorr : I'll take it if it will get a little bit higher operating environment. One last one on I&L, it's interesting that multiples -- take up multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits. This one happened to be a better quarter. You talked about some company-specific events, some sales and the up markets, but I guess the question is, is are you finding opportunities that will also put money to work especially on the equity side. I saw the UFC deal and I am a huge Conor McGregor fan, but that was close to six times, the six times cap. So curious about how you see the investing environment for I&L? Harvey Schwartz : So the opportunities for a while have been more on the debt side. You've seen the I&L balance sheet transition. When you see it again this quarter it is going to close to 80% debt, but selectively we're certainly seeing opportunities whether they be in what we recall other forms of equity, real estate or other areas, but selectively we've seen some good opportunities in corporate equity. As you're probably seeing, we're in a market now raising a fund, and the reception to that has been quite strong. Glenn Schorr : How big is the I&L balance sheet now? You said its 80% Fixed Income, but it's over 100 now? Harvey Schwartz : So just to give you the exact number, it's 98.9 billion, [indiscernible] just under 99 billion, and that's up $1.8 billion quarter-over-quarter. And I said almost 80%. It's 78% really debt and other assets, which leaves you basically with $21.5 billion of what we would categorize as equity. Glenn Schorr : All right. Awesome. Thanks. Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Christian. Christian Bolu : So a question on your consumer lending efforts, given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced, may we just talk about how you think about reputational risks and how you mitigate it? Harvey Schwartz : Yes, so it's a great question. So I think the short answer is providing value to the consumer. So one of the reasons we have said so many times and this is going to be a very deliberate and methodical approach and a bit of crawl before we walk in this business is because we're well aware that this is a new effort for us. Now and some of this is not new for us, our technology skills, the risk management, but the interface through the technology with this new important client base, it's a different space for us. So we've hired, obviously, people with decades of experience. But I think the greatest mitigating factor is slow growth, monitoring it very closely.  But also, when we put this together, we took input from consumers, and it really is, I don't know if it's the first-ever, but it\u2019s really is a lending product that is driven by consumer input. And so that means providing them with flexibility, with real value, with simplicity. And that's why we've come out with something, and we got feedback, consumers don't necessarily like and they don't understand the fee structures.  So we created a no-fee product, no small print. If you call our call centers, people pick up. Some of these things are simple, but they're quite important in terms of what consumers want. And if you deliver what consumers want and you really control your processes, then obviously, you create value and you deliver what regulators want also. Christian Bolu : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a cleanup question. On the buyback, $1.2 billion in the quarter, which is a bit lower than the first half run rate. I know the last CCAR cycle buybacks were back-end weighted. How should we think about the pace for this cycle? Harvey Schwartz : So you're right. A year ago, there were some [indiscernible] that attach, which led to more backend weighted profile. This year, we had a bit of flexibility in terms of how we'll approach the next couple of quarters, but a lot of this i6s going to be driven by edging out the environment and demand for the balance sheet. We would really like to start putting our capital to work if the environment improved from where it is today. But certainly, there's some flexibility in the profile for us to go up a little bit from these levels. But again, certainly not committing to that. You know how we think about capital management, and share repurchase for us is not to be equated with dividends and so it's going to be dynamic. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you Harvey. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi, Mike Michael Carrier : Can you just first, question on capital ratios. Your ratio continues to improve. Based on we had some recent comments by [indiscernible] and where CCAR is heading into '18, did anything change in how you managed through that process? And then just with your last comments on the last question on balancing buybacks versus investments, are you starting to see some opportunities to make investments? And maybe it's because of market share opportunities globally but just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Harvey Schwartz : So again, on the ratios, as I mentioned, 14 under standardized and 12 4 are advanced. By the way, just [indiscernible] and I'll know I get the question Mike, its 13.4 standardized fully phased and 11 9 on the advanced fully phased.  In terms of the stress testing, white paper and govern it relates comments I'd say at a high level, obviously, they put a ton of work into this with various constituencies. We \u2013 our initial frameworks were their framework seem quite awful. And it seems somewhat consistent with the way we actually manage the firm. So we manage the firm obviously on the forward-looking basis in terms of how we stress tests. We obviously also manage the spot capital ratios. And under our spot capital ratios, as you can see, we have lots of capacity. And so we'll have to see ultimately the details in the MPR, but again, they did the right thing here by giving the bank the opportunity to make adjustments because as you know, this won't be incorporated into the 2017 cycle.  And so the extent to which firms need to adapt, will be able to adapt after we see the MPR. But I think our starting point puts us in a great position and again the treatment of share repurchase and we'll see what happens with balance sheet and other things. But we'll take our normal approach in terms of capital management from here. But it seems like the right direction. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on I&L. When you look at some of the things that the Fed has put out there on physical commodities and some of the pressures on that part of the market versus what you guys have been doing on the debt side, just where do you see the outlook based on maybe some of these potential changes, the increase in RWAs? And what you can still grow versus what could potentially be at risk? Harvey Schwartz : So that's a great question. In terms of why we just talked about commodities MPR. So the market's been waiting for this for a while. As you know, we've been in the commodity business for decades, and we think it's really important that the Federal Reserve\u2019s taken the lead here in terms of an important area of focus for us in the industry, but especially as it relates to ultimately establishing uniform standards across the industry. So we welcome all that.  With respect to our business, we've obviously been very vocal in our commitment to the commodity business, and some of that I think maybe that gets misunderstood. So I want to underscore for you a bit. What we're committed to is serving our clients and their needs and you kind unpack that a bit and simplify by saying there's really three activities that are critical to our clients. It's critical for them to hedge, and that's consumers and producers would have commodity price exposure. Financing of those businesses is critical. And then obviously, market-making activities, which provide liquidity to the markets under a critical component of making those markets function. That's what we're most committed to. You've seen over the years, we've been reducing on balance sheet, investing in commodities. And so we'll work with the industry and with regulators like we would in any MPR process. But what we're more focused on ensuring that those services from a Goldman Sachs' perspective and across the industry can get provided to clients in a safe and cost-effective way. No different than if we were to approach any of the MPRs. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi Matt. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base for the [indiscernible] platform in terms of FICO scores, income or however you're defining it? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So with this launch and with this one product, we're focused on the prime borrower base. Matt O'Connor: And I guess, how do you define prime? I mean, it's a pretty big segment overall. Harvey Schwartz : So we would define it broadly for you. Let's just say above 650 FICO category. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just over time, will you provide more disclosures on this? Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover, there seems like it could be one of the meaningful new initiatives that's out there in terms of change in the profile the company a little bit, and I think more disclosures over time will be helpful to be able to track the performance. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. We're happy as it grows, obviously as it becomes more meaningful, I mean just to underscore this. I got an e-mail last that we booked our first loan. So if you want to continue, if you want to consider that continuous updating of financial disclosure, Matt, but I don't mean to make a lot of your question. Obviously, as it grows and becomes more meaningful, we'll spend more time with you on it. I think the important thing now is that, we make sure that everyone understands the product, the pace we expect to move at, which will be very deliberate and slow. And that in terms of return for long term, if that's kind of where you're getting, obviously, I talked a lot bit about the consumer here but we built this business to be accretive in the long run to Goldman Sachs returns. But we're certain, we're happy to keep you updated. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then completely unrelated, any color on the regional performance within fixed income trading this quarter? Harvey Schwartz : No. There was nothing specific that jumped out. It was really more across the products but it wasn't anything, particularly in the regional clouds. Matt O'Connor: Okay, all right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi in the past, you've mentioned that you felt some competitors were having a more permanent retreat from the market. Did you see some of the benefit of share gains this quarter as part of your capital markets revenue? And also your comp ratio was up 100 basis points year-over-year. Are you trying to hire more people or pay more in an effort to gain share? Harvey Schwartz : So with respect to the market share, certainly over the course of the past year, I would say there's been periods, particularly things like some of our core strengths, Prime Brokerage in fixed income, across the regions, we've seen discrete shifts in market share. I would say when we look at it in terms of the core businesses, for example, like credit, as we monitor those market shares, certainly with certain client segments like asset managers, it feels like we're picking up market share. Again, one of the difficult things about market share is you really need volume to grow.  And even though obviously our performance this year significantly better than last year, it's the best quarter we've had in five quarters. You really need activity levels to pick up from here. Now just in terms in the second part of your question, the 41% of this 49 is our best estimate. We told you forever that as a conceptual matter, you should expect in periods where revenues should decline that compensation and benefits expense should lag that and obviously, we talked to you ton about operating leverage. And so as revenues grow, you should also expect compensation and benefits expects to lag that growth because of the operating leverage. But at this stage 41% an output. Mike Mayo : And one follow-up. Brexit, is this a chance to gain additional share? Or is this just pain that everybody has to share? And do you think more business shifts to the U.S.? Harvey Schwartz : I would say that Brexit potentially is something that could drive share to the U.S. I think what we've witnessed over the last several years is U.S. firms like ourselves with really, really strong market shares and leading business positions whether you look at FICC, investment banking, equities, asset management, if you're a leader in a franchise throughout this cycle, particularly as activity picks up, I think there is share to gain. I think our European clients need us. But in terms of Brexit, I think it's unclear whether that's having any impact at this stage. It feels like early days. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi Betsy, how are you? Betsy Graseck : Hi good. I just had a couple of questions. Looking at the VaR that you guys put out in your note obviously in the press release. It seems like volatility actually came down a bit in certain segments and yet the VaR came down as well. And I look at this and I'm thinking is there an opportunity for you to allocate a little bit more in this environment and continue to generate some nice sized trading revenues? Harvey Schwartz : So I think that observation is correct. I think what's most important about that observation is just the capacity we have under the capital ratios, so obviously. But again, VaR is going to be driven by market volatilities and by client demand. And as client demand picks up or as market volatilities pickup, certainly you would expect that to translate through. We're not feeling constrained at all really only by the macro environment and our client appetite is same. Betsy Graseck : So in this past quarter it was more function of client demand pulling back because it feels like you have the capital capacity to have had more of allocated this past quarter? Harvey Schwartz : When you look at it in terms of so you are talking about year-over-year sequentially and you look at -- sorry, my allergies [ph] are bad today. If you look at more sequentially it's kind of mix of our total level is coming down and what I'll call position changes. If you look at year-over-year it's more about position changes. I think your big point is this environment wasn\u2019t a particularly strong environment, again it's the third quarter it's got some of the seasonal characteristics. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. And then just secondly on Asia, could you give us a sense as to how you guys are reorienting your Asia franchise, I noticed that there was some headcount changes over there and some management changes, so could you give us a sense as to what the strategy is for that region? Harvey Schwartz : So, as you remember from the last call, we talked about the expense initiatives we launched in the first half, which translated to $700 million run rate savings. Anything you are reading in a press is a bit distorted. This process in Asia it just a continuation of the process that has been ongoing for the rest of the firm. In terms of Asia completely committed to the region. Betsy Graseck : They make sense. I'm just saying I think there is also a comment around the Head of Asia was changing and so wondered if there was a shift in focus on? Harvey Schwartz : No, they are completely unrelated events. If you're sitting at Magic Me [ph] yesterday you would have heard Mark talked about how we joined the firm in 1976 and he just thought this would be a perfect time for him. But now they are completely unrelated in terms of there is nothing strategic in that. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : I wanted to follow-up on the I&L questions. Specifically, maybe you can just give us some color, maybe some examples, of how you have been continuing feed the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting that you have been doing over the past couple of years. Because you've harvested quite a bit, and yet you have been able to maintain that asset line item in the $21 billion, $21.5 billion range. And in the context of that, maybe you can comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up. Harvey Schwartz : So in terms of I&L balance sheet, again you are right to point out that $21 billion, $21.5 billion have been relatively constant. Obviously, that from a smaller component of the balance sheet I mentioned before it's close to 8% and 8% is really lending another item. And so I don\u2019t have details in front of me to give you blow-by-blow breakdowns on where reinvestments are occurring. Obviously, corporate private equity has been slow over the last couple of years, but that $21.5 million 20% of that now is made up of real estate globally.  And so that's been a meaningful participant. Now why have you generally not seen the asset class going lower? Obviously it's about high class problem. The assets have been performing, the markets have been generally going up over the last couple of years and you've seen that performance as I&L segment. So that's part of the gives and gets. In terms of I think you are -- I think -- I don\u2019t think you are much talking about brokers you are talking about the fed discussions with congress, very early days and we'll see how that evolves, is that your question? Guy Moszkowski : Yes, I think that there was some -- there was -- before the commodities NPR came out the fed had also I think made some noises about asking for congressional guidance I guess on cutting back on merchant banking that's allowed within broker. And I was wondering if you had some sense of whether you would be able to continue to seed that equity line and keep it in the range that it's been in or grow it if in fact there're further restrictions on merchant banking. Harvey Schwartz : Well, obviously the opportunity exist, we think we are providing an important layer of capital, but these conservations evolving, it's super early, so there'd be no way for us to interpret or give you any guidance on that. Guy Moszkowski : Fair enough. I guess the other question, also I&L-related is, and had this has to do with the negative operating leverage comment that you had made for the Firm broadly. So for the nine months, your revenues are down; your comp is down not as much, maybe a couple of percentage points differential, which is a negative operating leverage. But the biggest component of the revenue decline has been I&L. My question is, if I&L had declined in line with the rest of the Firm, would it be possible to keep the comp declining in line as well? In other words, would you have been able to maintain your margin better if it hadn't been I&L that was driving the revenue down? Harvey Schwartz : So on the competition benefit expense you are right, so revenues are down 15%, you relate any competition benefit expense down 13. Now I wouldn\u2019t -- maybe we characterize that as negative operating leverage I don\u2019t know that's meaningful negative operating leverage and the reason we are able to achieve that almost lock step decline, it was because of the expense initiative we launched in the beginning of the year. In terms of contribution of an individual segment, we look at this as firm wide collective as we go through the competition process. And obviously competition as we repeated to you many times before, it's about performance, but it's also about managing the company for the long term and executing our strategy for the long term. So it's not going to be a -- a competition process not going to driven by one segment contribution one way or another. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead. Fiona Swaffield : Hi. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning. Fiona Swaffield : I just wanted to ask -- good morning. About pricing you mentioned -- we talked about market share, but have you seen given that some banks putting less capital to work than others, any impact on pricing in any of your products, and there is the follow-up as well on the tax rate now that is coming lower again what are you thinking about for the future? Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : So in pricing at the margin it's very business specific, we have seen in some cases that I'll call a rational re-pricing and things like prime brokerage. But again in this low volume environment I don\u2019t know how much that you will see, in other words, the same low volume, low growth environment we have globally that's contributing to what it looks like in the future extraordinarily strong competitive environment for our businesses is the same thing that doesn\u2019t allow for lot of price improvements. And so I think these one of your things where even though it has taken while you need environment that is challenge for a while or to get competitors retreats of the same challenges don\u2019t allow for price adjustments, it maybe overtime you see price adjustments, but certainly things the more capital intensive parts of the business like prime brokerage where we are market leader. In terms of tax I think in terms of your estimate obviously it will be driven by regional contributions, but I would say 28% to 29% that range. Fiona Swaffield : Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Jim. How are you? Jim Mitchell : Good. How are you doing, Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Good. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a question on Asia I guess in a more positive way, you have the Hong Kong, Shanghai connect going into place later this year, it seems like when the Hong Kong Shanghai connect went in you guys had a nice boost in equity trading the industry did in the first half of 2015. Do you expect something similar this time around? Harvey Schwartz : I don\u2019t know, necessarily we have a strong view in terms of the immediate. I do think that over the intermediate term it's an important development. I think more broadly, well it might not be a straight path to increasing volumes, I think more broadly in Asia our perspective is and with China that we are on a long upward trajectory of activity and our role and ability to work with clients in the region, whether its trading, advisory, capital raising, this just feels like a very long positive trajectory, but it\u2019s not going to be straight line. Jim Mitchell : Right okay. Fair enough. And then maybe a follow-up on the pipeline. You guys did note you're down year-over-year. Is that mostly M&A and can you give any more color on what you're seeing in terms of the outlook on the pipeline? Harvey Schwartz : So the pipeline feels pretty good when you talk our M&A team. And the backlog sequentially was up, not down. But the activity levels that I mentioned in terms of completed transactions in the market, obviously down over year after very, very healthy levels. The best perspective I can share with you is the one I get from talking to our M&A bankers. And it hasn\u2019t shifted much over the course of the year. The same fundamental factors that are contributing to the last two years of M&A activity, generally low topline growth, a desire to drive efficiencies, access to the capital markets, all those factors still in place. Now regionally the U.S. field is more active then Europe and Asia fields a bit more active than Europe, but I am giving you really very localized commentary. Long-term it feels like the fundamental factors are in place. Jim Mitchell : And the underwriting side of the equation? Harvey Schwartz : So in underwriting as you saw, we've had very strong debt performance and we had a record for the first nine months of this year on a year-to-date basis. I mentioned before that half year IPO volume or meaningful portion of the IPO volume actually occurred in September. So it does feel like we are starting now again into a market where a lot of that activity that got pushed from the first quarter into the second quarter that that still exists. So we feel reasonably good about activity levels in the capital markets on an intermediate basis. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes, I wonder if you could give us some more color on the new private equity fund? I saw a press report saying it's between $5 billion and $8 billion. But if you could just comment on the targeted size and mandate? Is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity, or is it broader? And then as a follow-on to that, if it's $5 billion to $8 billion, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising $18 billion-plus. So what's the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle market? To do fewer deals or to bring in more co-investors? Those kind of my questions. Harvey Schwartz : No I am happy to talk about it. I don't know if I'll get to all of your questions, but let me just give you the high level. So we are in the market, there is really two fundamental reasons why we decided to engage in the fund raise. One was really to have a full offering for our private wealth clients. And the second is if you look at the capital regime particular under CCARs as it related to private equity, corporate equity specifically, those capital requirements continue to adjust. So they are giving us the flexibility to utilize the funds and to provide that to our clients. It seem like it made a ton of sense. Now in terms of the fund size, we have been talking about $5 billion to $8 billion, that\u2019s what the team feels is the right size for the horizon that they are thinking about. So they are not looking the raise the largest one of the world despite the fact that there\u2019s been very significant interest in terms of how we are approaching it and in terms of its focus, its focus will be on corporate private equity. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it? And is it the standard asset management 1% and 20%? And I assume that these will show up on the asset management side? And then kind of related to that, is this all a wealth management, asset management, standalone business that's walled off from investment banking? Or can there be cross-pollination between the two? Harvey Schwartz : Well the activities, the activities allow for us obviously to work with our investment bankers, but it is an asset management driven product and its broker compliance, in its design. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. So first question on non-comp. I think you took a charge here in occupancy. Is there some benefit that we should see flowing through in subsequent quarters from that occupancy charge this quarter? Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So we took a $63 million charge. This relates to one asset that we leased out. The run rate on that is small, but generally speaking, we look at these things, we look for a reasonably short term in terms of payback, in terms of recouping those expenses but this has been something we were just waiting for the market to recover, but it's a small item. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then, hoping to ask a follow-up for your previous comments on FICC. I think you commented that the quarter wasn't a particularly strong one, even though the year-over-year growth was good. And it seemed like you commented that you are gaining share in FICC, at least among some market participants. But if we look at year-to-date trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are growing double digit plus over 2015 year to date, whereas Goldman's revenue is down. Can you help us understand maybe why that's diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you shifting away from certain clients or what have you? Any help you could give us there, Harvey, would be great. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. It's no problem. I think that's more environment-specific. So it could be in some aspects, different footprint. All these businesses at this stage in FICC, and we don't have much visibility in FICC competitors, they're all very different. Some of these are enormous balance sheets. Some of them are very big in emerging markets, some are not. I think when you look at it I wouldn't overemphasize the first quarter '15, which I think is really the factor that's influencing your math. And again I wouldn't overemphasize the performance that we had in the third quarter either, because things just don't shift that quickly. I think that the third quarter was solid for us. But as I talked about currencies, commodities was down year-over-year. So it certainly wasn't an environment we were hitting on all cylinders and even with that, we were in a double-digit ROE environment. So it feels pretty good to us and the momentum feels good. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey Harvey, Wanted to start off with just a follow-up question relating to the earlier merchant banking discussion. Recognize that many of the recommendations are, in fact just that, that have come from the regulators. But just thinking about the strategy for this business, longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it's been a very good profit source, historically, but it also consumes significant amounts of capital. And under a CCAR lens, some have speculated it could even be ROE dilutive overall. I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of the high-end regulatory scrutiny, whether you have considered strategic alternatives for the business, such as an IPO or a spin that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling? Harvey Schwartz : So I think you're right to underscore, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that over time, the CCAR requirements under -- let's just use private equity investing and corporate equity have certainly increased. Now the nice thing about that analytic framework is it's perfectly transparent with the global market shops are etcetera. So you can certainly evaluate investments that you're making. Now we're talking about investments at the bottom part of the capital structure and so in terms of the return profile, we're obviously very selective about how we deploy that capital. But as I mentioned before, one of the nice things about launching this fund is it does gives us flexibility in terms of how to think about deploying that capital and it creates a new important product for our clients. So we have options. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. That's very helpful color, Harvey. Thank you and maybe just one follow-up on the capital side. Actually, we're shifting over to the denominator. It is quite evident that you have made significant strides in mitigating your standardized RWAs. I think it's down about 15% since the end of 2014. But the advanced risk rated assets have actually crept higher. I know some of that is going to be a function of increases in op risk. But I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk rated assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. So as I mentioned on the advanced transitional, we're at 12.4% under the current capital regime. Obviously, that gives us more than enough capacity. We obviously have things that roll off and things like that, but not material enough for me to highlight for you. But to the extent to which I think at this stage whether you look at the supplementary leverage ratio, standardized, advanced, we have the tools in place through our return on attributed equity framework, the ROE framework, which we talked a lot about. We have the tools in place at this stage and more importantly, the culture, the people engagement across the entire firm. We will adapt if needed but right now we feel we have more than enough capacity. Steven Chubak : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Sure. Steve. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning Harvey. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of quick ones. You mentioned that there was the strongest inflow of AUM in the quarter was in fixed income. Any color as to what was driving that and if those were -- was that all liquidity or was it slightly higher margin flow? Harvey Schwartz : No. So liquidity products, I believe, it's up $2 billion in the quarter. So this was long-term fee-based assets that were really the driver. And the team has done a very good job in their advisory businesses and so that I would say would be the more meaningful part of the driver in terms of this quarter's flows. Matt Burnell : Okay, and just circling back to another question previously asked. If I back out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like, as well as litigation, it looks like you are running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio. I understand revenue can be a bit volatile, but it's been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate? Or is it really going to depend -- should we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio? Harvey Schwartz : We don't target a ratio. You should think of the ratio as an output. Now obviously, we have been very diligent around expenses over the last couple of years reflecting the environment. If you happen to have a lot of historical financials, you would see that market development this quarter was under $100 million. I think it's the lowest it's been in seven years. So obviously we've been very focused on this, but we don't target a ratio. And a big driver obviously is BC&E and if you saw big activity pickup, that would move with the environment as well. But we're very focused on expenses as you know. Matt Burnell : Yes, thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Hi, how are you Harvey? Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what happened this quarter and what's occurred over the course of the year. And in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business, obviously you know the statistics much better than I. But advisory may be moving to a new, lower plateau than what we've seen recently. And with all the cross currents running through the trading environment and through the investing environment, how do we contemplate the overall go-forward mix of business? Harvey Schwartz : So I think we don't target the mix, as you know. We focus on the clients in those businesses where, as you know, we have leading market positions and so we feel good about that. I think it's a bit more of what's your expectation for the environment is. We control the micro issues we can focus on, our client engagement, expenses, capital management. But a lot of the things are outside of our control and I would say that in aggregate, when you look at the vast majority of our businesses, this is not an extraordinary environment, despite the fact that third quarter performance was strong on a relative basis, there's lots of challenges regionally. You could certainly envision an environment that was significantly better from where we are today. You've heard us say this a lot, but we look for growth and an environment of negative interest rates in vast parts of the world is not indicative of a role that's growing at great pace. So you could see much better environments than we have today, and we hope that ends up being the case. Eric Wasserstrom : But just from a planning perspective, I mean is there any reason to think that, or that this environment, that those policy dynamics are changing over, let's say, a medium-term horizon? Harvey Schwartz : Just like I think they could change always pretty quickly for a negative, and we tend to be more contingency planners. You could certainly see things break for the high side. Obviously, rates could move back into positive territory, which should be an indicator and there's been speculation in the market that we might be more in the cusp of that in the United States. I think the most important takeaway is whether or not we move into that environment in the near term? We're incorporating all those current factors in how we're running the firm today, which in a pretty muted environment, we're able to grow revenues, demonstrate a double-digit ROE and we truly believe we're well positioned in the franchise with significant operating leverage if the environment improves. So we feel quite good about our position, but we are rooting for a better environment for everybody. Eric Wasserstrom : And if I could sneak in one last one on Marcus. Most firms that do similar kind of lending typically have a 2.5% to 3% pre-tax ROA. How does that compare with what it is you are targeting? Harvey Schwartz : So that's perfectly consistent with what we're able to generate. Of course, we don't have any legacy infrastructure cost structure. This is all white sheet of paper for us. So we'll see how it evolves, but that's certainly achievable. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Thanks, good morning, Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Hi how are you, Devin? Devin Ryan : Good. So it seems like we are speaking a lot more about your technology footprint on these calls. And you have been increasingly highlighting a number of those capabilities. When we look at those initiatives, like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee, or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle? And I guess that's part one. Part two is as you think about future investments in the technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing, rather than defensive? Harvey Schwartz : So it's a great question. I would say that broadly speaking, and this won't be completely inclusive, but I think you can define our technology strategy as focused on client engagement and those tools and services we can deliver to clients that provide differentiated value to those clients, and you see that doing us in our capital markets businesses and obviously you see us creating that with Marcus. Two, there are times when we feel like given our core technology skills, we're in a position to develop technology, which will be better enhance outside of the firm ultimately even though we incubated it in the firm, and Symphony will be a great example of that. We feel like as an information sharing platform with better security, better compliance controls, we felt like that was something better utilized by a broad range of market participants. And lastly, our own technology internally is quite important for making us more efficient and adapting to regulatory change and managing our risks, and that's obviously been very core to what we do. So we look across all three of those different platforms if you will, for lack of better language. I would say the most important thing in addition to controlling the firm is our client engagement and Marcus reflects that trend as it relates to consumers. Devin Ryan : Got it, that's great. Very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. Just any update on the momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank? Just how that has been, I don't know if you give any numbers there, but how that's been maybe relative to expectations now that we are a little ways away from the launch? Harvey Schwartz : So it's more than exceeded our expectations. I think in the past quarter, we picked up another $1 billion of deposits and so the momentum there feels quite good and the team's done an excellent job of transitioning the platform into Goldman. Devin Ryan : Got it, okay. Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi Harvey, actually I'm all good. All my questions were asked. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Going back to the comp ratio, and what you said earlier about as revenues go higher, the comp ratios should really drift lower. As we are having lower revenues this year, the comp ratios should probably drift a little bit higher than it was last year. Is that the concept you were really pushing forward earlier? Harvey Schwartz : So this is completely consistent, Marty. As you know, you've been following us forever in terms of broadly speaking and it may not be the case in any given year. But broadly speaking, we've encouraged you to expect that compensation and benefits expense will lag revenue moves. So you've seen it through the first -- through the year-to-date. 41% is our best estimate but revenues are down 15%; compensation and benefits expense, down 13%. In environments where revenues are up, base case, you should expect a lag in that direction also particularly given how much we've emphasized operating leverage with you. Marty Mosby : That is what I thought. I've just been spoiled the last two year with revenues being fairly consistent on a year-on-year basis. Harvey Schwartz : Yes. Marty Mosby : The other thing I was going to ask was, you had mentioned you had four businesses, which is outlined on income statement very clearly. When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, it really doesn't fit into any of those four. Do you feel like you could put deposits maybe in asset management? But are you thinking about this as evolving into a fifth business? Or how would you tuck it into your overall strategic mix today? Harvey Schwartz : So three of the four segments are up this year obviously. The one segment, which we worked hard to unpack for everybody is Investing & Lending and this would very naturally fall into the lending segment. Obviously, to the extent to which down the road as an activity in and of itself, if it had material contribution, we could talk about highlighting more, but I think it will give a lot of attention as it grows anyway, it's pretty exciting. Marty Mosby : Got you. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Marty. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : So since there are no more questions, I just really want to take a moment to thank all of you for joining the call. Hopefully, I and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to Dane or the team. Otherwise, please enjoy the rest of your day and I look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Take care, everyone, and thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 18th, 2017. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, you may begin your conference. Dane Holmes : Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that, by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of Risk Factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2015. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our Investment Banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audio cast is copyrighted material to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Harvey Schwartz, who is also joined by our Deputy CFO, Marty Chavez. Harvey? Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Dane and thanks to everyone for dialing in. As many of you are aware, Marty will be assuming my position in April. As you would expect, we\u2019re already working side by side to ensure a smooth transition in the coming months. Over his career, Mary held positions of increasing responsibility in investment banking, institutional client services and then most recently as our Chief Information Officer. During that time, Marty established a track record of creating tremendous value for both our clients and our firm. Having worked closely with him for over a decade, I have full confidence that Marty will continue that track record as our Chief Financial Officer. With that Marty would like to make a few comments. Martin Chavez : Thanks Harvey. Just a few brief words from me. I have really enjoyed the opportunity to meet many of you in my prior role as CIO. I look forward to building upon existing relationships and building new ones in the months and years ahead. I have always found our conversations to be extremely insightful and valuable to effectively managing our firm. Goldman Sachs has a long tradition vigilantly focusing on risk management, operational excellence and maintaining a conservative financial profile. In my new role, I have every intention of continuing that focus and tradition. With that I will turn it back to Harvey. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Marty. Okay, now let\u2019s walk through the fourth quarter and full year results then Marty and I are happy to answer any questions. Briefly on the fourth quarter; net revenues were $8.2 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share were $5.08 and annualized return on common equity was 11.4%. With respect to our annual results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $30.6 billion, net earnings of $7.4 billion, earnings per diluted share of $16.29 and a return on common equity of 9.4%. We grew book value per share by 6.7% year-over-year. When reviewing 2016, it\u2019s helpful to contrast the performance between the first half of the year and the second half. The year began with a number of challenges but ultimately ended with a lot of positive momentum. For example, the start of the year which has historically been a period of high activity, which instead impacted by significant concerns regarding the economic outlook, equity markets posted substantial declines and credit spreads wide and materially at the start of the year. This combination of factors translated into a difficult operating environment for our clients and by extension for our firm. In the second quarter concerns regarding global economic growth moderated but other concerns including the potential implications of the Brexit vote surface. Ultimately, net revenues in the first half of the year declined by 28% year-over-year with a vast majority of that declining occurring in the first quarter. Switching to the back half of the year, the global economic outlook improved reflecting solid economic reports particularly in the U.S. The prospect of diverging monitory policy and more pro-growth policies in the United States drove both activity levels and asset prices higher. For example various fixed income market volumes in the second half of 2016 rose double digits year-over-year. U.S. investment grade credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points. U.S. high yield spreads tightened by over 150 basis points. And the MSCI World index climbs 6% during the period. Ultimately this drove improved client sentiment and better environments. As a result, net revenues in the back half of the 2016 increased by nearly 16% year-over-year and included two consecutive quarter of 11 plus percent returns on equity. In short, we ended the year with positive momentum and a significantly improved operating environment. With that as a back ground, let\u2019s discuss the individual business using greater detail. As it relates to the quarter, investment banking produced net revenues $1.5 billion, 3% lower than the third quarter. A pick up in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting. For the full year investment banking net revenues were $6.3 billion, down a 11% from 2015 and a decrease in equity underwriting and financial advisory revenues, which was partially by record debt underwriting revenues of $2.5 billion. Our franchise remains very well positioned. We ended the year as a leader in global announced and completed M&A and as a leading equity and debt underwriter globally. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the fourth quarter, advisory revenues were $709 million. The 8% improvement relative to the third quarter reflects an increase in a number of completed M&A transactions. We advise on a number of significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter including Procter & Gamble, $12.5 billion merger with beauty business into Coty. Fortis Inc\u2019s $11.8 billion acquisition of ITC Holdings Corp. And Rackspace Hosting\u2019s $4.3 billion sales were of Apollo. We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, B/E Aerospace\u2019s $8.3 billion sales for Rockwell Collins and Capsugel\u2019s $5.5 billion sales for Lonza Group. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $777 million in the fourth quarter down 12% sequentially as debt and equity issuance slowed. Equity underwriting net revenues up $212 million were down 7% compared to the third quarter as follow-on offerings decreased. Debt underwriting net revenues decreased 13% to $565 million from robust issuance levels in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in energies \u20ac4.6 billion IPO to Soros $1.6 billion high yield bond offering and it seems [indiscernible] $1.2 billion IPO. Our investment banking backlog improved from the third quarter, it was lower compared with very strong level at the end of 2015. Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter down slightly compared to the third quarter. For the full year $14.5 billion of net revenues were down modestly compared to 2015. FICC client execution net revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, up slightly quarter-over-quarter as many businesses benefited from increased client activity. This more than offset typical year end seasonality. Commodities increased significantly during the quarter as higher energy prices drove better market making conditions and more client activity. Currencies were higher compared to the third quarter increasing client activity. Rates were down slightly relative to the third quarter, client activity was solid driven by diverging monetary policies. Credit and mortgages decreased in an environment that included lesser issuance and generally tighter spreads. For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $7.6 billion. This translated into a 6% increase year-over-year excluding DVA gains from 2015 results, given the difficult market conditions in the first quarter of 2016, 6% growth particularly notable. In equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion down 11% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues were $459 million, down significantly across both derivatives and cash products. Commissions and fees were $736 million, up slightly relative to the third quarter as global client volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $398 million, up modestly on a sequential basis For the full year, equities produce net revenues of $6.9 billion down 12% year-over-year. In 2016, we were impacted by less favorable market conditions and lower client activity and equities client execution. This compared to a relatively robust performance in the first half of 2015. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $61 million up from $57 million in the third quarter. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity security generated net revenues of $1 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $457 million which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $300 million. For the full year, investing and lending generated net revenues of $4.1 billion driven by $2.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $1.5 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Our net interest income within debt securities was more than $1 billion for the year. In investment management, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion. This is up 8% from the third quarter primarily as a result of $224 million in incentive fees largely from alternative investment products. For 2016, investment management net revenues were $5.8 billion, down 7% year-over-year largely due to lower incentive fees. For the fourth quarter assets under supervision finished at a record $1.38 trillion. The $32 billion increase versus the third quarter was driven by $17 billion of long term net inflows, $31 billion of net inflows into liquidity products, partially offset by $16 billion of market depreciation. On a full year basis, we had $42 billion of long term net inflows primarily driven by fixed income and $52 billion of liquidity product inflows. Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was down 8% for 2016 reflecting the decline in net revenues. This translated into compensation in net revenues ratio of 38.1%. Fourth quarter non-competition expenses were $2.3 billion. The quarter included a $114 million donation to Goldman Sachs gives our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year non-compensation expenses were down significantly due to a decrease in provisions for litigation and regulatory matters. Excluding litigation provisions, non-competition expenses would have been down slightly year-over-year. Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the end of the year. Total staff was approximately 34,400, down slightly from the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year was 28.2%. Our global core liquid asset ended the fourth quarter at $226 billion and our balance sheet was $862 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.5% using the standardized approach. It was 13.1% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Our prudent approach to capital management is demonstrated by the strength of our capital ratios and had supported our return of excess capital to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.1 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $166 per share. As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 27 million shares for the year reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.1 billion dollars of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $7.2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016. Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. As we've said many times before, we have a healthy respect for the dynamic nature of our industry and we have an established track record of being responsive to changes in operating environment. As we discussed, the first half of 2016 was challenging. In response, we undertook and completed a $700 million expense initiative in the first half of the year. We continued those efforts in the second half of the year and ultimately generated nearly $900 million of run rate savings. When undertaking any expense initiative all about finding the right balance, you want to protect near term results without impacting long term prospects. We believe we found the right balance in 2016. This can be seen in our ability to effectively serve our clients as activity picked up in the second half of the year. It also reflected in our continued investment in technology and infrastructure including our launch of Marcus. Most importantly our expense discipline and the strength of our client relationships leaves as well positioned to deliver significant operating leverage to our shareholders in a better operating environment. In summary, we entered 2017 from a position of strength. We have a robust financial profile ending the year with $226 billion in liquidity more than a quarter of our balance sheet. All of our risk based capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements well our share count sits at a record low. Importantly, this means we have the flexibility to navigate shifts in the operating environment including the positive scenario where we experienced a significant increase in client activity. Finally, our global franchise remains as strong as ever reflecting our commitment and investment to serve our clients. Meeting their core objectives, we\u2019ll continue to be the basis for our long term success. Thank you again for dialing in. Marty and I are happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Hey good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So I have a fixed income related question. Back in the first quarter of 2015, the Swiss re-pegged and things went bonkers for a couple weeks and you guys made a ton more money but then things die down for like six quarters. This quarter, we obviously had the election and a couple other events and things went bonkers, but it feels very different to me and more permanent and client needs are changing and we have monetary policy diversion, so I'm leaving the witness here, but does it feel different to you guys and does that equate to this could be the first year in many that the fixed income fee pull could grow? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah you know it's a great question. I mean the quarter you're reflecting on obviously the first quarter of 2015 very strong quarter for us, we had nearly a 15% ROE. That was the quarter as you point out, there were monetary policy announcements and I think there was a little bit of a relief activity there because that was viewed as increased monetary policy QE and that was a trend now. As we all saw over a period of time that ultimately led more to concerns about lackluster growth and it led to concerns about deflation and then it led to concerns ultimately that actually QE policies at the limit may not be effective and may actually present risks. I would say you could look at our fourth quarter, but I think it\u2019d be better to look really at the second half of the year and what we saw from clients in the second half of the year was basically a build of confidence and expectation that we might see stronger fiscal policy, divergence of interest rates that we weren't heading into a deflationary cycle more confidence about economic growth, and so I would say there was increased optimism around the world. Now those are the kind of things that always drive our business, our clients are very sensitive to that it changes sentiment. So I would say that that felt more like a trend across the past six months of the year. Glenn Schorr : Okay, maybe some of yours ex-colleagues consensus more tweets and increased activity levels, kidding. Let last question on INL. I - we got - it's good to have that reprieve in terms of the INL funded divestments. I'm curious if it changes at all how you approach the way we asked you every quarter about what's left in equity, what do you need to divest, and that whole game plan I\u2019m curious on your thoughts there. Harvey Schwartz : No, so I\u2019m happy to walk you through it. So I mean in order flow I walk you through every quarter, longer cover fund $106.7 billion you take out an amount that confirms that's $200 million that leaves you with $6.5 billion. Of the $6.5 billion, $1.8 billion of that is inner fund but those entities are already public, they're trading publicly on exchanges. So they are already liquid, they are just in a process of being sold down. So now with respect to Volcker as was more that's expected by the marketplace because you remember under the original construct of Volcker, it was never designed to force sales, it was obviously very encouraging of compliance. So there was an expectation everyone would do what they could save to comply. But again there was no there's no desire for fire sales and so the expectation here is that we've now submitted for the extensions, we'll go through the extension process, but we've been a good say that during if you read their communication, you expect extensions to be approved broadly across the industry. For us, it hasn't changed the approach of the business. It's always been about ensuring that we provide the best returns for our clients because as you know, we're invested alongside our clients in these funds. Apply more than you wanted, but I just try to cover the whole thing. Glenn Schorr : I appreciated, thank you. Go ahead we can go on to the next person. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : All right, thanks Glenn. Operator : The next question is from line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Harvey. And then welcome on board Marty. So hate to nit-pick in a strong quarter, but performance in equities was noticeably weaker than peers. I\u2019m curious if there were any onetime items in the quarter or anything that you think drove underperformance, and then maybe more broadly if you could update us on how you're feeling about the competitive position in that business. Harvey Schwartz : So look I think you're right to point out it wasn't our strongest quarter. I mean in terms of the franchise, we feel great about the franchise at this stage and certainly we feel quite good about the competitive dynamic. No matter how you look at the business, whether you look at it as our global footprint, prime services, our ability to make capital our position underwriting, we feel incredibly good about it. Quarter-to-quarter there were always going to be one offs, there are a handful of things that we\u2019re less than probably this quarter, but I wouldn't read anything into it. Christian Bolu : Okay. And then as soon as your last one, I'll give you a pretty one accounting question here, but the accounting standards for the tax impact of shared based compensation, I believe this schedule to change this year. I'm giving share based comp is a meaningful part of the income statement curious if that has any impact on your kind of forward the way your incomes may looks going forward? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so it's a very detailed question. It's great that you're asking it actually. So as everyone not might not be as aware as you are Christian but under a gap change, basically the change requires us to recognize the tax impact of the difference and the value of shares that we grant which a grant date versus delivery date and our tax expense line on the income statements. Now prior to the change that would happen and shows equity. So there is two observations here, so at best we can estimate it today, it could be in a range of $400 million, $500 million in terms of a reduction in the tax rates, but this is just a geographic realignment under gap, this has no impact to capital where the strength of our capital, but you will see a shift in the recognition. And obviously anyone can feel free to follow up more with Dane if you really want to get into the details of the gap stuff. Christian Bolu : Okay, it's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Mike, you there? Michael, you there? Operator : Michael, check your line to see if you\u2019re on mute. One moment. Michael, are you there? Michael Carrier : Yeah, can you hear me? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, we can hear you now Michael, but we couldn\u2019t hear you before, so the asked question we didn\u2019t get it. Michael Carrier : Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot. First one just on expenses, so you guys have been doing a very good job on controlling the expenses and we saw the operating leverage in the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense depending on what potential changes happened with policy and regulation, is there some way to give us some context on the amount that has been spent whether it's on regulation, compliance, technology it maybe since 2011, 2012 that could either shift around depending on the outlook, obviously there\u2019s a lot of core and that\u2019s going to stay in place, but just wanted to get a sense on what that increase has been despite you guys imaging the overall expense base well? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah. Difficult to quantify that for you obviously it's been a huge investment in terms of risk, technology, compliance and we continue invest. I think the thing that we've been able to do is as we've invested and as we\u2019ve comply with the rules, we never be use technology and training across the teams to be as efficient as possible which is why this year you would have seen that non-compensation expense was the lowest expense since 2007 and we were able to also execute the $900 million run rate savings, but who knows where we\u2019ll end up in terms of the rule set, but obviously we\u2019ll always look to comply and comply in the most efficient way possible over time. Michael Carrier : Okay, and then just as a follow-up. It's been a while since we've been in an environment or people may more positive on like the growth outlook, and just wanted to get a sense and this is somewhat Glenn's question and you answer it, but maybe broader on trading and banking. What do you guys look at in terms of seeing that pick up in client engagement, I know you mentioned the IB pipeline is up quarter-over-quarter but even on trading in terms of balances, investment management maybe inflows, just wanted to get some sense on how we can kind of see the follow through or the impact of better economy in that translating into in a stronger revenues? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. Look the thing that informs us the most is the work that all of our people do whether they are in banking, asset management, whether they are in equities or fixed income all around the globe engage with their clients every day. So these are relationship that build up over decades, they are invested in over decades, you know our teams of sitting with CEOs, they are sitting in board rooms. And the best way for us to get a pause on that globally is the feedback we get from clients every day. And as you know over the past several years there\u2019s been a general sense of concern with respect to global growth that was reinforced by a lot of the monitory policy around the world. And so I would say as we come into 2017, activity levels are quite high. You know we can\u2019t - we\u2019ve come out of a very low volume, low volatility environment for a number of years. We\u2019re happy to see how this year progresses. But with the shipping policies around the globe, it\u2019s an extraordinary catalyst for client dialog, for decision making and for content and that\u2019s really where as a firm that\u2019s where we really want to drive value and drive value with content. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Just give us some of the increased optimism that you\u2019ve talked about on this call and the pipelines, just kind of big picture, how do you think differently about staffs, call it how much you lean forward versus trying to optimize, it\u2019s like a last several years you and the industry have been focused on optimizing to kind of lower pool of revenues got for regulatory environment. And just how do you think about you know it\u2019s not going to be a complete 180 going to maybe been aggressive, but how do you think maybe about leaning forward a little bit more, whereas the too loaded think that way? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah. So look, this is all - this is all just about balance. So we are in a cyclical business within a pro-cyclical industry. And so as we make decisions about investing and controlling expenses, you know these things are mutually exclusive. So if you just look at the past year, obviously we responded very quickly to the tough first quarter. As I mentioned we finished with $900 million of run rate savings completed in the year. But at the same time, we never stop hiring. We launched Marcus. We acquired the digital lending platform. And so we stayed very front footed and we feel well positioned. Now to the extent to which there were more demands on the firm by creating efficiencies to this part of the cycle, it gives us the flexibility to invest in an improved part of the cycle. That\u2019s the best thing about having capital ratios as strong as our capital ratios are right now are having liquidity levels where they are because to extent to which there is demand, we can respond to it. So you can be well positioned and you can be efficient at the same time. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : This is the first change since the announcement about Gary Cohn, so you know Harvey, how do you kind of approach your new position and then for Marty, how does your past experience you know help you or maybe present a challenge for you in the CFO role going from CIO to CFO is somewhat unique? Harvey Schwartz : Right so - well obviously we\u2019re all going to miss Gary. It\u2019s fantastic that he is willing to contribute all of his experience to a country and it\u2019s a long tradition of senior leaders that Goldman Sachs doing that. So we\u2019re - again we\u2019re all going to miss Gary but we\u2019re all quite proud on what he is decided to do. In terms of the transition in my role, I\u2019ve obviously been CFO for a bit over four years. You David Solomon and I, we\u2019ve been on management for years. We found the same floor for years and you know which have affinities based on our experience. David spent more time in investment banking. I\u2019ve spent more time in institutional client services. But I think it lays out pretty easily actually in terms of how he and I will work across the firm. It\u2019s big place with lots of clients. So we\u2019re both pretty excited about it. And that transition is already underway. In terms of the transition with Marty, we\u2019ve already been working side by side. Marty has been shadowing me for a couple of weeks and then he is working on his transition. For those you met Marty, I don\u2019t know he about 150 pounds less than I am. So following my shadows sounds like a strange thing. But that\u2019s how we are approaching. And we got - and look we have a deep bench Mike, so we\u2019ve done these things across the firm for years. Mike Mayo : And can we hare - I mean Mary you are ready to talk? Martin Chavez : Sure Mike. I\u2019ll just add, going to continue to firm\u2019s traditions and risk management and maintaining funding profile fortune to inherent such a talented team. And in keeping with the times and industry, applied maths and software to these problems or risk management but continue to do, we\u2019ve always done. Mike Mayo : And just one last follow-up for you Marty, so coming from CIO, is that what it\u2019s about applying maths and software and how else can you apply your part experience to the new role? Martin Chavez : Well, there is maths and software and everything that we do and so that\u2019s just a perspective - particular prospectively but really it\u2019s risk management. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep doing as I\u2019ve always done, been let the firm for a long time, worked in many of our businesses always with an emphasis on risk. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Martin Chavez : Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hey, good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to ask a little bit about for productivity inset, we\u2019ve had conversations in the past where when we are in a world or at least what we\u2019ve discussed is in a rising rate with an established trend you know upside rate environment. In the past you\u2019ve had improving our productivity and I am wondering how you think about that, at this stage do you feel like you\u2019ve captured what you think you would capture overtime you know step function 4Q versus 3Q or is there more to go here? Harvey Schwartz : Well I think it\u2019s difficult to me forecast. I would say the following I think if rates continue to rise and it\u2019s a reflection of optimism and concerns around deflation abate and concerns around economic decline debate and they are replaced with expectations of economic growth and activity and confidence and client sentiment continues to shift. I think there is meaningful upside in terms of the activity levels we could see in fixed income. So we\u2019ve been pretty optimistic now. We\u2019re positioned for a number of scenarios obviously given all the steps we\u2019ve taken over the years. And whether it\u2019s risk or capital, obviously we have a lot of capacity. Betsy Graseck : And then secondly on INL, in the equity\u2019s line even I saw 2Q, 1Q obviously the market overall was up a little bit, certain factors up significantly and I had thought that your focus in many of the activities you have is a bit more of an industrial versus a services angle. So I am wondering if there is some - could you give us some color as to on the INL equity side how much of that was realized versus just a mark and what you still have left in the bag for realizations going forward. Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so one thing I really want to point out because I know this question comes up about realizing and better you ask it but everybody asked it realize versus mark. The most important thing is the portfolio was always mark-to-market. So I think what you mean by realize is monetization activity. Obviously in the past year, monetization activity wouldn\u2019t have been as high necessarily as in prior years. We don\u2019t talk to it that way as much. You know the INO balance sheet, you didn\u2019t ask it but the INO balance sheet is roughly $98 billion and nearly 80% of it is lending related activity. And so it\u2019s $21 billion what we call equity. But it\u2019s idiosyncratic and what you generally see over a period of time is a portfolio has outperformed markets because of the quality of the investment professionals and asset selections. But I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that it\u2019s one category or another. I think you are right to say that obviously industrials are representative but it\u2019s very idiosyncratic and a year like this where equity issuance is down. You wouldn\u2019t expect to see lots of monetization. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then last on fees and asset management you know across the industry been some chatter on see pressure seeing some industry leaders cut season more of the passive oriented products but maybe you could just give us a senses to how you are thinking about that business and managing it for the several years? Harvey Schwartz : So I think as a management for us among other things also a bright spot. As you saw assets under supervision finish at a record was up 10% for the year. I think we benefit from a number of things, I think we benefit from a fact we have a very unique well franchise. Obviously it was a mix of strong flows underneath that 10% rise. And this reflects a couple of things, obviously the performance we\u2019ve delivered to the clients but I do think it\u2019s the nature of the capabilities that have built over a number of years. So I think so far if you look at as in terms of asset flows, we\u2019re a bit of an outlier. We benefit from scale to your point of fees because we\u2019re certainly not immune to the general shipped in lower fees across the industry whether it\u2019s conventional pure competitor or competitive that\u2019s only dedicated to the asset management space, we are immune to that, but we benefit from having scale in our operation have been near $1.4 trillion on assets. Betsy Graseck : Great, now I am wondering on the fee rate side is here a bit of uniqueness you have in the high network client relationship versus institutional \u2026? Harvey Schwartz : No, I think we have strengthened both client segments but our fees are obviously competitive with the rest of the world. Betsy Graseck : Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Harvey; Marty, welcome to the party. Martin Chavez : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : So quick question, I know it\u2019s been touched on a couple of times, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s definitely I think front of investor\u2019s minds here, so hopefully you don\u2019t mind me touch it on it again. And you spoke a little bit of it Harvey with shifting policies globally, we need a better dialog which certainly is positive. But when we think about is especially in the U.S. seen down administration and the themes of the potential for reduced regulation and taxes seems like it could have both a first and second derivative impact on Goldman and so not only the direct impact of you but the clients and clients feeling better and improvement risk apatite. So how do you think about that opportunity assuming that plays out, is there a particular way in which investors should think about that opportunity and is there any historical context or other periods that you think are particularly relevant or helpful and trying to consider that? Harvey Schwartz : Well I guess I\u2019d say a few things. I think when you say indirect and direct you mean direct obviously we\u2019ve been relatively high tax payer and so tax rates come down. We\u2019re a beneficiary but obviously changes in tax policy can be a huge catalyst for how all of our clients think about deploying their capital strategic decisions and so that\u2019s board room dialog which obviously we\u2019re always front and center to. So I think that\u2019s what you meant by direct and indirect. So I would agree with that. I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify just like it was difficult to quantify in 2012, 2013, 2014 how concerns around deflation and low economic growth will impact activity in a number of businesses. I think it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how increased optimism. You know we like to say in some respects, confidence is the best stimulus. And the extent to which we enter a period of increased confidence with respect to economic growth, physical policy, you mentioned tax policy, I think there could be a lot that happens. Now we\u2019ll have to see all these policies of ours. But who knows we could be at the beginning of a long term trend, we may not be. Again it was difficult to predict things in 2012 and how they will be in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Brennan Hawken : Yeah, now that\u2019s fair Harvey and yeah that was exactly what I was pointing on not only direct impact on you but the clients and the optimism. So okay, that\u2019s helpful. You\u2019ve touched also on the operating leverage, so maybe I want to hit on that a bit. It seems like up taking comp ratio in \u201816 was probably more of a revenue story, so want to confirm that\u2019s true and then when we think about maybe the other side of that blade or the other blade of that knife if we start to see revenue environment improve, how should we think about operating leverage at Goldman given all of the work that you\u2019ve done on the expense front which you\u2019ve talked about a couple of times? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I appreciate you are recognizing the work. Obviously over the last several years, whether it\u2019s around expenses, de-risking the firm and growing the capital ratios, returning the capital all that work has really been about positioning the firm, while at the same time obviously maintaining all of our connectivity to clients with really, really significant operating leverage. Now this year revenue is down 9%, compensation expense down 8%, obviously that translate into a small uptick in a compensation ratio. But I would say at this stage, the center which we see hail wins in activity and increases in revenue will see that translating even more so now than we would have before to the bottom line in terms of operating leverage. And so I can\u2019t quantify for you but if we see a big uptick in revenues, certainly you should see a decline in the compensation of ratio at which of course again as an output we\u2019re committed to delivery in this result. Brennan Hawken : Terrific, thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Thanks. Martin Chavez : Good morning. Guy Moszkowski : First question is - yeah, good morning and Marty nice to meet you. Martin Chavez : Thank you. Guy Moszkowski : Question on equities related to follow-up one of the earlier questions that was asked, you talked about maybe there were some things that weren\u2019t quite so perfect. I was wondering if you could characterize that a little bit further were there some episodic block losses that were significant in the quarter, anything that as we think about sort of what\u2019s achievable going forward. Harvey Schwartz : There were a handful of transactions that\u2019s it\u2019s always going to be the case in a marking making business when you are providing liquidity to clients that could have an impact that was the case this quarter. Some other things that are normal quarterly contributors and index rebalancing were more neutral and there were impact. Again I wouldn\u2019t read a lot into it from quarter to quarter. Remember we break out equity client execution from the whole business, so that\u2019s a different level of disclosure then you are going to get from anybody else. So you should expect given at that\u2019s the line where we are most interacting with clients and capital commitments, you should expect that to be more volatile. I just don\u2019t think any of our other competitors whenever break that, so you don\u2019t see it. Guy Moszkowski : No, that\u2019s fair. Harvey Schwartz : But that\u2019s not - it wasn\u2019t the greatest quarter but there is nothing in there. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. And I noticed that when you are doing a full year comparison there you talked about Asia for the full year but not for the fourth quarter, so it was - it was either more of a domestic issue in the fourth quarter or just more broadly global? Harvey Schwartz : Remembering the first half of 2015, there was a huge uptick in activity in Asia and then basically there wasn\u2019t replicated. You know the client connectivity remained robust in Asia as ever but this year just not as active as it was last year. Guy Moszkowski : Got it, and then a much broader question, I know you don\u2019t like to set ROE targets but I was wondering if in the context of what you might call for example unshackled interest rate sort of in a post QE environment and more broadly some other things that we talked about in terms of the new administrations goals and expectations thereof, can you speak to a realistic but aspiration ROE? Harvey Schwartz : Well, again we don\u2019t say targets because that\u2019s not the way we run the business. We run the business through thoughtful and efficient deployment of capital managing expenses and making sure we have the best people and we\u2019re focused on our clients. I guess you saw some of this in the second half of the year right, we had two plus quarters back to back of 11% plus ROEs and that wasn\u2019t on a huge uptick in activity. And again it\u2019s one date point but it\u2019s one all point two you know in the first quarter 2015, we had a 14.7% ROE, again that feels like a long time ago. We\u2019re actually more efficient now with more operating leverage now than we had then. What we feel as front footed in terms of our franchises we ever have, so we feel well positioned which is that we see the activity. Guy Moszkowski : And just final follow-up on that point about the activity levels and I know we\u2019ve had all of ten trading days as we get started here, so with all the necessary caveats, how are those activity levels starting the year? Harvey Schwartz : Way it\u2019s too early to count Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Yeah, fair enough. Okay, thanks so much. Thanks for taking my questions. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you, have a great day. Guy Moszkowski : You too. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just talk about the revenue side of regulatory change, I know it's not an easy question to answer, but I think there's been a lot of I guess hope and talk about sort of an easing of regulation what that could mean on the revenue side. So I don't know if there's a way to just sort of talk about it generally in terms of where do you see the most constraints right now and what would potentially benefit you the most whether it's easing of market making rules, whether it's some changes like we saw in the UK around exempting cash from the leverage ratio, if you could help that would be great? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, I wouldn't point to any one rule. I think what we've seen and one of the things I think gets lost in the global dialog around regulation is that you know eight years past the crisis, the body of work that's been created by the regulators whether it's Basel capital ratios, the implementation of CCAR, stress testing broadly globally, the leverage ratios, the requirements around liquidity, all those things that were designed to address points to systemic risk, clearing, margin requirements, all of that data reporting, I think sometimes gets lost in the narrative and have to step back and look at the past eight years and realize that and it\u2019s a credible body of work that regulators, the industry participants and the clients have actually created. I think long - I think the dialog around regulation and whether or not there should be some degree of pause and stepping back, I think that started really at the beginning of last year maybe a little bit before you saw some of that in the Basel Committee across the second half of the year, and obviously I think market participants regulators and also it seems like a very reasonable point in time to step back and assess we obviously have gotten some great benefits out of the regulation and the question is, is there a cost in economic growth. So this seems like a pretty normal part of the process in terms of taking a step back and evaluating it. Now specific rules I don\u2019t know we'll see what happens, it will change, we\u2019ll adapt however they change, I think we demonstrate our ability to do that. Jim Mitchell : But you can't, you don't feel there's one that's been more constraining than some others in terms of business? Harvey Schwartz : No, I mean if you actually look at our - if you actually look at our capital ratios they're strong across the board, liquidity is 25% of the balance sheet, and so there's not one thing that we would look at it. I think the bigger question for all of us is it's very difficult to measure the combined impact and the interaction of all these rules, and that's why it makes sense to take a step back. Jim Mitchell : Now that's all fair. And maybe just a quick one on banking, I think there's been chatter that while I think quote Animal Spirits are better and that's good for the outlook for banking I think there's some concern at least in the near to intermediate term with policy uncertainty that might hold things back a little bit in the shorter term. Are you seeing that it seems like M&A activities continue to be pretty solid, but not sure what you're seeing in terms of activity levels around uncertainty short term policy uncertainty? Harvey Schwartz : Dialog with - dialog in boardrooms remains quite high for us. I think it's fair to say that anytime you have a shift in administration which may present new policies that can have an impact on timing of transactions, because that could be a component. But it's really - it's a timing issue, dialog remains very high. Jim Mitchell : But you do see timing being pushed out, what you're seeing or? Harvey Schwartz : I think it could be a little bit, when you start having discussions around tax policy, tax policy obviously will have an implication for how people think about strategic transactions. But again it's an economic important to strategic transaction. It's not the strategy itself as discussed in the boardroom. And so but it could delay some transactions. Remember the transactions coming through from the pipeline before that will be closing. So again I think we're just talking about a timing issue, I actually think the environment is pretty robust in terms of dialog. Jim Mitchell : Okay that's great. Thanks a lot. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yeah, good morning. Harvey Schwartz : Hi Chris. Chris Kotowski : Hi, on these calls Harvey, you always talk about FICC trading activity in terms of volumes you know like commodities and currencies were up and credit mortgage down and so on. But whenever I speak with fixed income investors they always kind of be mown the lack of available liquidity in the markets, they complain that it's very hard to get anything done. And I'm wondering with between the kind of increased activity that you talked about and retrenchment of some of the competitors have bid ask spreads moved are they widening or is that not yet been part of the equation and do you ever expect that to be part of the equation? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, that's a good question. I think, I think it's - I think you have to parse it a bit, to be just you mentioned commodities well pick up on commodities. If commodity prices are going to be quite stable or just take energy and they're stable at a level for a period of time that is not necessarily a catalyst for big client segments for us producers of commodities, consumers of commodities, in the institutional investors that invest in energy that's honestly catalyst for decision making. Because they may have very determined levels at which for example a producer wants to hedge future oil production or project that they want to bring online. And so when you then see a big move in oil prices one way or another that's a catalyst for activity for our various client constituents. In terms of liquidity, I think it's fair to say that feedback from clients and it\u2019s not reason it's happened over the last several years across the industry. Is they feel like their ability to execute isn't what it was prior let's say to 2008 as a period it was perceived to have almost limitless liquidity. I think this activity picks up and volume begins volume you get improvements in liquidity, but every day we come in the door and we're offering our balance sheet, our clients in the best possible way that we can. Chris Kotowski : Okay and then I guess maybe as a follow up to that, I mean to the extent I guess I'd say consensus expectations build in two or three rate hikes a year, at what point does that become you know the kind of catalyst that you talked about in relation to commodities for activity? Harvey Schwartz : I can't predict it for you, again in the fourth quarter alone obviously but if you just - if you just look at fourth quarter of a fourth quarter, and I won't talk about necessarily obviously activity was high and it translate into an up 78% year-over-year for us in fixed income, but the catalyst of activity are pretty obvious, right you have the oil policy, interest rate shifts, movement in currencies, all those things are catalysts for activity. I think again it goes back to the broad question what's the driver of that activity, if the expectation is more progress moving away from deflation not inflationary, but not deflationary more inflationary in a normalized period of interest rates. Those were all positive catalysts what they'll be like quarter-to-quarter very difficult, but again coming out of eight years of declining interest rates, I think would - none of us really wanted to get used to that. And so I think getting into a period of normalized economic growth would normalize policy of normalized interest rates, I think that be a good catalyst over the forward for a number of years. Quarter-to-quarter that who knows. Chris Kotowski : All right. Thank you. That's it from me. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Steven. Steven Chubak : Good morning, hey Harvey, hey Marty. So I have follow up just to Jim's earlier question, specifically on tax policy and a comments Harvey that you made on M&A, you said that you view the changes really as more of a timing issue, but one of the constraints that we've been hearing from a lot of folks, is that efforts to broaden the tax base might in fact include restrictions on interest expense deductibility and could increase financing costs and reduce appetite for future debt. And what I'm wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated we do see reduced appetite from debt from corporates, as I inform your outlook not just from the M&A side, but even for DCM and it might even touch on corporate private equity as well? Harvey Schwartz : Well, but always puts and takes obviously that would be a very significant change in policies so would have implications for the way issuers would think, investors would think capacity, I think there's a lot of what's in the details around that. But I think it's too early to tell in terms of what the necessary predictions would be. Steven Chubak : Understood and maybe just sticking to changes in the GOP regime and the implications I could have, but focusing more on the regulatory side there's been a lot of discussion on the prospects of possible repeal or less strict enforcement of Volcker, and Harvey I know you touched on some of the change in terms of just broader messaging, but it just remains to be seen how that might impact your business, I know it's a little bit early, but I just want to get a sense as to if we do see an explicit repeal of Volcker how that would change your strategy, not just on the trading side, but would it in fact how you deploy capital within INL as well? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so it\u2019s a good question. Look as we said before, we don't make any decisions before we see a rule or rule change there be no difference here. I think most of the discussion around will go over the last several years by regulators and industry participants and clients going back to the earlier question is what impact has it had on market making capabilities across the industry, which is obviously the most important part of our business we're providing liquidity to our clients. I think in terms of the sort of the micro components of Volcker. We would take a look at it, if it changed in terms of our activities, proprietary trading we haven't been in that business in a long time, it was never a material driver and so we would look at it and whatever in the best interest of our clients and our shareholders that's how we evaluate it just like we devaluate any rule change. Steven Chubak : Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good morning, Harvey, good morning Marty. First a specific question then maybe a larger picture question. Harvey could you give us the updated common equity to one ratios for the fully phased in side of things, and just curious what the driver of the reduction in RWA this quarter was it was down about 5% quarter-over-quarter? Harvey Schwartz : So I'll just run through you, I\u2019ll just run through them both transitional and fully phase just the level side even though I went through them before. So under advanced 13/1 transitional 12/7 fully phased standardized again 14.5 I know I said that before fully phase 14. On the RWAs in advance 550 standardized 497 there were a number of drivers again we continue to focus on being efficient with our capital and sort of risk reduction across the number of items, operational risk in advanced was down from 126 to 115 and not just - that just reflects our continued focus on as best we can I mean zero operational risk events. Obviously that's our goal, and so we're starting to see an operational risk as you're starting to see the benefit of our focus flow through as older items roll off albeit as you know that that's a very slow process. Matt Burnell : And then for my bigger picture question one of your competitors suggested that there was on a year-over-year basis, but a mid teens decline in European revenues, I guess I'm curious, first of all if you saw that in 2016 versus 2015 in terms of the regional breakout and it with the Prime Minister May\u2019s comments earlier this week any update to your outlook in terms of what Brexit might or might not do to quiet activity more broadly across your European client base? Harvey Schwartz : Yeah. So look I have no visibility into anyone else's franchise, the breakdown in terms of our geographic contribution revenues wasn't materially different year-over-year certainly difference in - no meaningful difference in our European franchise. In terms of Brexit as we go through Brexit we just continue evaluated the same way, it is obviously going to be a long process, so in all kind of contingency planners play a very nature so we'll run through different alternatives. I thought some of the comments with respect to trying to ensure it's not disruptive, there's a long enough runway, all those things I thought some of those comments, but it is going to evolving situation. And so but I wanted to say the sensitivity to financials and understand a criticality of the industry across Europe. But of all those things we\u2019re pretty positive but again we're going to see how this evolves over the next couple years. Matt Burnell : Okay, fair enough. And then just finally if I can you booked your first loan in Marcus when we spoke last October, just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since them. Harvey Schwartz : Yeah we've booked more loans. I'm not counting and wanted time any more though that would have to be aware coincidence with the last call. It's going according to plan. Not in by that I mean our plan have been very deliberate growing it slowly our primary focus here is on the client experience we believe we've built I mean that differentiated for the consumer. And so we're being very attentive to that making sure we incorporate any feedback we get. And obviously risk management something we've done for a long time. So that's a big component of this, but as we've said many times to be a slow process. Matt Burnell : Sure, thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : You're welcome. Take care now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Harvey Schwartz : Hey Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi how are you? Just to follow up on a couple of questions that have been raised before, but may be taking a little more of a broader view of the balance sheet. I mean your RWAs are now it had fairly low levels now as far back maybe as my model might run. And in INL obviously the balance sheet there continues to decline although you're growing markets a bit. So overall kind of what is your - what should be our expectations about GAAP and RWA growth for 2017 and in particular is there anything that's occurring environmentally that causes you to sort of view that outlook differently than let's say three or six months ago? Harvey Schwartz : That's a great question. So you know I think I could be wrong on this by the way. So Dan will correct me, but I think it was - I think it was 2012 we were at investor conference and we did our first review of some of the capital tools we have built. And so I guess the best way I would sum it up in terms of how we thought about the risk reduction of the capital of that it goes all the way back to 2012 those tools of course took years to developing themselves. We were just displaying them in 2012 and it's really been about evolving the firm to understand that we need to ensure we use our capital in the most thoughtful way to deliver to our clients. And as I mentioned before over that period of time we've been able to grow market shares, deliver, I think last for the industry ROEs over a multi-year period of time and at the same time we sit here today with record low share count. So the short answer after that big summary because there are so many people involved across the firm in the divisions with the clients and in the federation it's just been years of hard, hard work and a lot of elbow grease to get us where we are now. The good thing about that is it gives us a lots of capacity, and it goes back to when we talk about operating leverage sure it's about expenses it's about capital, but it's positioning the firm in a way that we can respond to an uptick. And so I don't know if you asking the question could we grow risk weighted assets I\u2019ll tell you it would be - it's not the scenario I've experienced as CFO. But I would wish it for Marty over the years ahead that if he had the chance to deploy capital back to our clients not to return as much to shareholders grow risk weighted assets that actually with the firm has done for the vast majority of the firms history and those are the environments that you know we thrive in and so it was Marty and I'd pass the baton over the next couple of months, I'm hoping he gets to deploy the capital in that way with all of us across the firm. So that's my long winded answer. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks that's very helpful. Thank you very much. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Thanks, good morning, Harvey, Marty. Harvey Schwartz : Good morning Devin. Martin Chavez : Good morning. Devin Ryan : Maybe timely with Marty in his new role year, but technology headcounts now about a third of the firm has been the fastest growing area in recent years and arguably the most amount of kind of the newer initiatives have come in this area. So I'm going to put the cart before the horse here, but if we are moving towards more of this business friendly backdrop where regulation softening a bit, can you see a scenario where that trend actually changes in investment high touch personnel is where the incremental growth comes from or is it just technology growth is the secular trend diverse is there being some maybe cyclical component there as well. Harvey Schwartz : Well maybe I'll kick off and then I'll turn over to Marty and he can talk more specifically about technology, but I wouldn't say there's been a lack of investment in, I think the way you described it some of the other growth areas, right. So we've continue to invest and all parts of the firm, asset management, the new business as we've talked about launching, the acquisition of on line platform. So there's been a lack of investment in areas of the firm for years where we've seen more of a multiyear decline obviously they\u2019ve been super careful as they run those businesses. But I wouldn\u2019t describe it as we\u2019ve invested in technology, we haven\u2019t invested anywhere else. I know you weren\u2019t being that literal about it, but I just want to make sure we are clear for the call. But in terms of technology, specifically I\u2019ll turn it over to Marty. Martin Chavez : Yeah, so as Harvey says, we invest in both in high touched and low touched and really agnostic where evolving in the direction that our clients that are taking us. So as for technology has clients have continued to transact more electronically we\u2019ve invested more heavily in those capabilities, so that we can better serve them. We have a history of that kind of adaptation. We work with the regulators to make sure that those automated capabilities are the best-in-class and to the extent that the markets continue to be more electronic, technology make our people more effective and it strengthens our clients\u2019 engagement. Devin Ryan : Okay, great understood and appreciate all the color and absolutely you know understand the investments been across the firm, just curious on that incremental technology spend, but thank you. And then within DCM just coming back to some other questions you know had a really terrific year there obviously if the M&A backdrop improves from here that it could be supportive, on the other hand you know higher interest rates you see like my constrain some issuance, I know there is a lot of puts and takes. I am just curious kind of after such a good year, how do you feel about the intermediate term kind of outlook they you think that we can grow from here or kind of as you think about all the moving parts that this is the tough bar? Harvey Schwartz : I\u2019d say a couple of things first, obviously as you point out record year in the underwriting, the team done an amazing job, really working with clients and delivering for clients. So quite proud of that. You know the debt component of the backlog continues to growth, that\u2019s a necessarily forecast this year but the level of client engagement is quite high. I think there is always a temptation for all of us. I certainly do it to think of past cycles when interest rates went up in terms of the implications for markets and the market dynamic. This is such an extraordinary scenario that we\u2019re coming off of basically a zero rate policy. So I think if you look at history, the rate levels is still pretty low even though the tenner might have moved up a 100 basis points of one point. So I think if you split your questions and say well could you end up with less refinancing, I think that\u2019s certainly a case, but we\u2019re still in a very low rate environment by historical standards and so the extent to which we see growth, company see top line growth. There are CapEx activities and they are feeling confident, they want to finance. I think you could see a pretty good period for debt underwriting over the foreseeable future. But if you saw big rate moves disproportionate charts for someone expected reason, obviously that could have an impact too. I don\u2019t think it more up in rates and in itself, it should necessarily be considered a negative in an absolute sense. Devin Ryan : Great, very helpful, thanks guys. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks. Operator : You next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah, thanks, good morning. Just two quick questions, one in the investment management, with regards to the flows in liquidity products, I mean you\u2019ve seen those kind of flows pickup in the fourth quarter of last two years, is this just where you saw this quarter again a seasonal effect with regards to liquidity products? Harvey Schwartz : No, I think that has been a trend has been in place, we had a very big commitment to this business. We\u2019re a scale provider in this business makes us very efficient in terms of an aggregator of those kind of flows. And so I don\u2019t know necessarily there is always some seasonality in these businesses but I wouldn\u2019t - this is a long term commitment of this business, I wouldn\u2019t say that is necessarily seasonality in of itself it\u2019s driving it. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just one quick one to on the European equity franchise, have you seen any impacts yet from if it due and kind of what\u2019s your thoughts on long term impacts from if it due as it becomes adopted? Harvey Schwartz : Lot of focus on it, too early to tell. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great, thanks. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Christopher Wheeler : Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Harvey, you\u2019ve been talking a lot about capital efficiency and obviously you\u2019ve been very effective in that area. Can I just ask you a question about the way forward here, because you\u2019ve been obviously very aggressive in buying back stock and keeping the capital sort of very sensible levels, but of course you\u2019ve enjoyed or you could say haven\u2019t enjoyed having stock which is trading at or below book value or tangible book value for the last few years, you\u2019ve not got a situation very happily where you offered about 1.4 times tangible book. I am just wondering I know that you want to keep the dividend at a manageable basis in terms of your payout ratio so that you don\u2019t see in swinging around volatile in a volatile fashion but have you started to think about special dividends which is being the subject that come up rather than buybacks which is start to become dilutive? Thank you. Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, so look it\u2019s a good question. Just one think you said that I thought you said something like we enjoyed buying back a little book, just somewhat clear I never. Christopher Wheeler : I know. Harvey Schwartz : I never felt that enjoyable, I am always running for the share price and I am running our shareholders, so for all of our shareholders I am going to be bit confused. We route for a higher trading level. Capital management is a long term process and so if you actually did a math in terms of the fourth quarter buying back book causes about $0.24 a share. If you actually did a corporate finance analytics around share repurchase versus dividends, share repurchase because you are reducing share and you are returning capital at the same time are always more accretive than a dividend. Now that\u2019s a map and that sort of stuff. I think the bigger issue is how we want to run the company. And we\u2019re not thinking about changing how we run the company because where the share price is. We try to run the company in the best way for our clients and our shareholders and ultimately that translates to a higher share price. But out policy respect to the mix being more heavily weighted to share repurchase, that has suited us quite well. It gives us exactly the kind of flexibility we\u2019ve talked about in the context of this operating leverage goal so that if we see a big pickup in demand, we can deploy that capital to our clients where ultimately that\u2019s our preferred way to deploy the capital. But you shouldn\u2019t expect any change in long term policy in terms of how we think about share repurchase relative to dividends. Christopher Wheeler : Thank you, very clear. Harvey Schwartz : Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : Great, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully Marty and I as well other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. Any additional question come up, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane. Otherwise enjoy your rest of your day and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call on April. Thanks so much everybody, have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Net revenues were $8 billion, net earnings $2.3 billion, earnings per diluted share $5.15, and our annualized return on common equity 11.4%. Net earnings included a $475 million tax benefit related to a new accounting standard for share-based compensation. This benefit increased annualized return on common equity by 250 basis points.  The first quarter of 2017 can be characterized as a period of recalibration. In the fourth quarter, strong economic data, the prospect of higher rates and the potential for more pro growth policies in the United States drove improved sentiment and greater investor conviction. Equity markets responded accordingly, reaching new highs. However, during the first quarter, the market began to reconsider both the pace and strength of economic growth, particularly in light of uncertainty regarding upcoming European elections and legislative challenges in the United States. This confluence of events resulted in tempered expectations, a modest retreat in equity prices from intra-quarter highs, and a more benign market environment. The operating environment in the first quarter was mixed with lower activity in several institutional market making businesses offset in part by generally higher activity in investment banking. For our investing clients, the opportunity set was negatively affected by lower volatility. For example within FICC, D10 foreign exchange volatility approached its lowest level in two years for the dollar-euro pair. This was a headwind for client volumes. Reduced volatility also negatively affected client activity within another macro FICC market, commodities. In the quarter, crude oil volatility averaged its lowest level in more than two years.  A similar dynamic was underway in the equity markets. For example, realized volatility for the S&P 500 reached its lowest level for first quarter in 50 years. Not surprisingly, U.S. cash equity volumes were generally down both sequentially and year-over-year; however, other client segments were more active in this environment. For example, the first quarter of 2017 was a relatively attractive financing environment for corporate clients. Higher equity prices provided a conducive environment for initial public offering and equity issuance more broadly, and debt issuance remained strong as credit spreads tightened and all-in funding costs remained relatively low versus historical levels. With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, 15% higher than the fourth quarter as we saw increases in both M&A and underwriting. Our investment banking backlog decreased since the end of the year. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the first quarter, advisory revenues were $756 million, up 7% relative to the fourth quarter.  Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the first quarter, including Reynolds American\u2019s $60.6 billion sale to British American Tobacco; Mead Johnson\u2019s $18 billion sale to Reckitt Benckiser, and ConocoPhillips\u2019 CAD $17.7 billion sale of selected assets to Cenovus Energy. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the first quarter, including Technip\u2019s $13 billion merger with FMC Technologies; Formula One\u2019s $8 billion sale to Liberty Media Corporation, and Clarcor\u2019s $4.3 billion sale to Parker Hannifin.  Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $947 million in the first quarter, up 22% sequentially reflecting a pick-up in both equity and debt underwriting. Equity underwriting revenues were $311 million. This was up significantly compared to lower levels of activity in the fourth quarter as a result of an increase in secondary offerings. We ranked first in global equity and equity-related and common stock offerings for the quarter. Debt underwriting revenues were up 13% to $636 million and benefited from strong industry-wide leveraged finance and investment grade activity. During the first quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs, participating in Change Healthcare\u2019s $6.1 billion financing to support its joint venture with McKesson Technology Solutions; Great Plains Energy\u2019s $4.3 billion investment-grade offering to supports its purchase of Westar Energy, and Snap\u2019s $3.9 billion IPO.  Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.4 billion in the first quarter, down 7% compared to the fourth quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 16% sequentially as client activity was low following a relatively active fourth quarter. As I mentioned, despite a benign market backdrop, low volatility across many FICC-related products constrained the opportunity set for our clients and reduced activity levels. Most of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter over quarter. Commodities and currencies were significantly lower. Client activity was relatively light amid low volatility. Credit declined despite healthy issuance and tighter credit spreads as clients were less active as a result of low spread volatility. Interest rates were roughly flat sequentially. Mortgages improved significantly in an environment that included generally tighter spreads. In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues for the first quarter were $1.7 billion, up 5% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $552 million were up 20% compared to a weaker fourth quarter, but roughly consistent with the quarterly average for 2016. The business operated in an environment with global equity market strength but lower volatility. Commissions and fees were $738 million, flat with the fourth quarter as activity levels remained generally low. Securities services generated net revenues of $384 million, down 4% quarter over quarter. Turning to risk, average daily VAR in the first quarter was $64 million, up from $61 million in the fourth quarter.  Moving onto our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.5 billion in the first quarter. Equities securities generated net revenues of $798 million, reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $666 million and included approximately $350 million of net interest income. On the Volcker Rule, we applied for and received a five-year extension for substantially all of our remaining covered funds, which totaled approximately $6 billion at the end of the quarter.  In investment management, we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. This was down 7% from the fourth quarter primarily as a result of lower incentive fees. During the quarter, management and other fees were roughly flat at $1.2 billion. Assets under supervision decreased $6 billion sequentially to $1.37 trillion, primarily reflecting $35 billion of seasonal liquidity product net outflows. We had $5 billion of long-term net inflows, including $5 billion of outflows from the sale of our local Australian business.  Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is the lowest first quarter accrual in our public history and 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first quarter of 2016. The reduction in the accrual rate reflects the completion of the nearly $900 million expense initiative that we announced last year. First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, 6% lower than the fourth quarter and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter included higher charitable contributions and the first quarter of last year included lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Now I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the first quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,100, essentially unchanged from year-end 2016. If you exclude the tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the first quarter would have been nearly 30%. Our global core liquid assets ended the first quarter at $222 billion, and our balance sheet and Level 3 assets were $894 billion and $23 billion respectively.  Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.9% under the Basel III advanced approach. It was 14.2% using the standardized approach. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.4%. Finally, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter. We also raised our quarterly dividend to $0.75 per common share from $0.65. We have now more than doubled our quarterly common stock dividend per share since 2011. Now for some brief summary comments. The first quarter of 2017 had its share of puts and takes and served as a reminder of the benefits of having a diversified global client franchise. The diversity of our client franchise is an important input to the revenue stability that we have seen over the trailing 12 months. We have consistently generated roughly $8 billion of revenues in each of the past four quarters despite a variety of different environments. This reflects the relative balance across investment banking, FICC, equities, investing in lending, as well as investment management.  As we look forward, we remain focused on several operational objectives : first, providing world-class advice and execution services to our global clients and delivering the whole firm to them. Second, operating efficiently, which means striking the right balance between addressing challenges and investing in future opportunities. It also means positioning the firm for operating leverage. Third, being a prudent capital allocator, being disciplined around risk-adjusted returns, and looking to return capital to shareholders when we can\u2019t find attractive opportunities to deploy it. Fourth, recruiting, retaining and developing the most talented teams possible at every level, in every business and for every region. Finally, leveraging technology across all of these areas to inform our decision-making and, most importantly, to drive better outcomes. We believe meeting these operational objectives is essential to serving our clients, our shareholders, and the broader marketplace. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Harvey for some closing remarks. Harvey Schwartz : Thanks Marty. In short, I just want to say thank you to everyone. Over the past four and a half years, I have thoroughly enjoyed engaging with all of you as the firm\u2019s CFO. I\u2019ve also truly appreciated both your support and your challenge during our many discussions. There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s made us a better firm and it definitely made me a better professional. I really look forward to continuing our relationship in my new role. As we have talked about in the past, Marty and I have worked together closely for more than a decade. Many of you have gotten to know him better during the transition. During my nearly 20 years at the firm, he\u2019s one of the most talented people that I\u2019ve had the privilege of referring to as my partner. This being my last earnings call, I just want to say again, thank you everyone. Now back to Marty. Martin Chavez : Thanks for the kind words, Harvey, and all your support. Well, why don\u2019t we just move onto the Q&A portion of the conference call? We are obviously happy to answer all your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] The first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Good morning, thanks very much. I can\u2019t avoid the FICC question. So I heard all your comments. I\u2019m curious to see how you\u2019d describe what exactly happened in the quarter. When we think about it versus a peer group that was reasonably consistent and stable this quarter, how much do you attribute to maybe the client mix, which I heard a little bit in your remarks, versus maybe just being caught a little bit facilitating client flow during the quarter? Martin Chavez : So Glenn, unfortunately we don\u2019t have a lot of transparency into others\u2019 results, so here\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing it from the perspective of our results. As we mentioned, there were very low levels of volatility in the first quarter and subsequently low client activity. Dollar-euro vol, lowest in two years; crude oil vol, similar figure, and given the strength of our commodities business, this is unique to our firm. To the extent that the market environment improves, economic growth accelerates, client confidence continues to grow, client activity is likely to increase, and that ultimately drives our opportunity set. We feel great about the competitive position and have a tremendous amount of capacity to serve the clients as activity levels improve, and we believe our clients recognize that. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Fair enough. Then I personally hate this question but I\u2019m going to ask it anyway, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, but plenty of talk in the market about some version of Glass-Steagall or some greater separation than we\u2019ve already seen with the capital requirements and the regulatory environment. Just curious to get your thoughts on this call. Martin Chavez : Sure. We, like you, don\u2019t have any information on what the specifics of a proposal might be, and we wouldn\u2019t find it productive to speculate or make assumptions. Our focus is entirely in delivering to our clients under the current regulatory construct of our bank holding company. Glenn Schorr : Okay. One last simple one, or maybe not. MiFID II, just curious on how you\u2019re preparing for what\u2019s coming and what your gut reaction is to the outcome. Can Goldman be a net beneficiary? Martin Chavez : So as we all know, there are many components to MiFID II. As for the execution, we\u2019re working with our peers and with our clients on protocols and platforms, and making sure that we have the services and products that our clients require for their execution needs. As for research, we would generally expect the MiFID II changes to bring greater transparency, and as that happens it seems likely that scale and high value-added content will be important components, and we have both of those as a core part of our offering. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks. Appreciate all the answers. Thanks. Martin Chavez : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Marty. Good morning, Harvey. Martin Chavez : Hello Christian. Christian Bolu : So just back on FICC again here, could you help us size in just dollar terms the issues around commodities and currencies? It would just be very helpful for us as we think about the forward outlook. Also, I believe you mentioned $8 billion of annual revenues in FICC, if I heard you right. Is that a good way to think about potential revenue generation of that business? Martin Chavez : Actually Christian, the $8 billion figure I was referring to was $8 billion roughly in quarterly revenues for the firm over the last 12 months. As for the size, I won\u2019t break out commodities or FX. What I will say is that it was one quarter. We don\u2019t extrapolate from a quarter. We didn\u2019t extrapolate from the fourth quarter last year where we outperformed, and we wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from this quarter. Having said that, we did underperform, and the underperformance was driven by commodities and currencies. Ultimately, we didn\u2019t navigate the market well, but no quarter defines the franchise. There is always things that we can do better, and it\u2019s important to note we\u2019re constantly analyzing our results with an eye towards continually improving them. Christian Bolu : Okay, got it. Thank you. So I know your predecessors never have commented on the current quarter, but just given the circumstance here and obviously some investor nervousness around the strength of the trading business, curious if you can make any comment at all as to how the second quarter has gone. Martin Chavez : Well, it\u2019s only two weeks and there really isn\u2019t any information or content there. Christian Bolu : Okay, all right. Harvey Schwartz : Yeah, the predecessor is still sitting here! Christian Bolu : I was hoping that he\u2019d ignore you! Harvey Schwartz : Come on, it\u2019s four and a half years. It\u2019s my nature [indiscernible]. Christian Bolu : Okay. Just a last clean-up one here. RWA ticked up in the quarter, both standardized and advanced. Curious if you\u2019re seeing anything at all in terms of the ability to deploy incremental capital or seeing demand for some of your capital by your clients. Martin Chavez : Sure. Let me just quickly take you through the RWAs. These are on the transitional basis. I\u2019ll start with advanced. Total RWAs in the quarter ended at $558 billion. That breaks down in $361 billion of credit, $83 billion of market RWAs, $114 billion of operational; and on the standardized approach $507 billion of RWAs, breaking down into $424 billion of credit, $83 billion of market. The ratios have ticked down 20 or 30 basis points since the end of last year, depending on which ratio you\u2019re talking about, and really it\u2019s on increased credit RWAs, which is primarily driven by lending for the advanced approach, and lending and funding transactions for standardized. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you very much for the answers. Martin Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : All right, thanks guys. Maybe a broader question and not just on FICC, but I\u2019d say FICC and equity trading. It seems like maybe over the past two years, the business has been maybe on a relative basis a bit more challenged, and we can point to a lot of things in terms of the client mix, whether it\u2019s hedge funds or investment managers, they\u2019re facing some pressures. But just wanted to get a sense - when you guys look at the business and the mix, are you positioned where you want to be, and then when we think about that in terms of the outlook, is there more that can be done on the expense or capital base or do you think that you\u2019re still--you\u2019re looking for a positive kind of revenue backdrop with the current mix that you have? I know that\u2019s a lot in there, but just trying to get a sense because it seems like it wasn\u2019t just one quarter. Martin Chavez : Yes, so I think it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re not focusing on revenue share, and while top line revenue and revenue share are among the many factors that we look at, the focus is on serving the clients, our impact and engagement with them, and on returns, so returns, not revenues, and generating strong ROEs over the cycle. As for expenses, it never feels perfect. They\u2019re just always really just part of the constant discipline here to look at expenses, and as you know, we have significantly changed that business over the last few years since beginning of 2012 to now headcount, compensation, benefits, risk-weighted assets, balance sheet all down. Michael Carrier : Okay, and then maybe as a follow-up, if you can give us the--I don\u2019t think you guys gave us the fully phased in unit ratios, and I think in the last quarter, maybe a quarter before that, Harvey, you mentioned just in terms of where you think the G-SIB buffer would pan out. Any update there? I know everything is kind of potentially in flux when we look at the outlook, but just how you\u2019re thinking about that. Martin Chavez : Sure. So under the advanced approach, the fully phased ratio at the end of the quarter was 12.5%, and under the standardized approach the fully phased ratio ended the quarter at 13.7%. As for the G-SIB buffer, it\u2019s too early to tell. We have lots of capital and a history of adapting. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Martin Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could elaborate on the comment about pipelines being down within the investment bank unit. I guess I\u2019m not surprised on the M&A advisory side, but I would have thought the ECM pipelines, given where market levels are, would have been net pretty solid. Martin Chavez : Sure. So the pipeline is good and we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. Many of the factors that one would look for remain in place, so CEO confidence, attractive financing levels, relatively supportive equity market backdrop. So I\u2019ll say cautiously optimistic. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, and then just separately on the comp rate, bringing it down a little bit this quarter. Should we think of that as more of an effort to smooth out the year so that there\u2019s not as meaningful of a decline in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year, or is this signaling a downward structural move overall? I realize it\u2019s only 1%, but wanted to ask what you\u2019re trying to signal there, if anything. Martin Chavez : It\u2019s our best estimate of the comp ratio, and it reflects the $900 million initiative that we announced last year. Because of severance and other effects, $500 million of it last year, $400 million more of additional flexibility in this year, and it just reflects that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, but no comment on do we get as meaningful of an adjustment in the back half of the year as maybe we have had in the past? Martin Chavez : It\u2019s just our best estimate. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Martin Chavez : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple questions. One thing we\u2019ve talked about in the past is during periods of rising rates, at least in the past you\u2019ve historically seen some improving VAR productivity during those periods. So I\u2019ve got a couple questions this morning just on 1Q tends to be the highest quarter in FICC, and my thought is, well look, if vol is down so much right now today, as you mentioned that\u2019s the biggest driver, do you--as vol increases, do you expect that the VAR productivity could go higher, like it had in prior periods of rising rates? Martin Chavez : So we would generally expect to see VAR efficiency picking up with greater activity and turnover. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Second question is on security servicing. You mentioned and you spoke briefly to the year-on-year decline. I just--could you give us a little bit more color there, because in the context of higher values in the markets on the equity side at least, I would have thought that there would have been an uplift in that line item, so I must be missing something. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s margins or if it\u2019s just activity levels. Maybe you could speak to what\u2019s going on there. Martin Chavez : Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. In security services, low volatility affected the opportunity set for many of our clients of that business, and it was evidenced in the weaker security services results which included a lower margin mix of client balances, including a move to easier to borrow securities, which has an effect. Betsy Graseck : Okay, got it. Then just lastly on the Volcker Rule, Marty, you mentioned that you asked and received the five-year extension here on the $6 billion. That will roll off over the next five years, I assume? I don\u2019t know what the duration is on that $6 billion. Is there anything more than that? You might be laughing, like who\u2019s asking about five years out, but I\u2019ll just ask the obvious question there, but then also how you\u2019re thinking about redeploying the capital that frees up as these assets roll off. Martin Chavez : There\u2019s nothing particularly to note. That extension that was granted applies to essentially all of the Volcker-covered funds, and as for redeploying, it\u2019s always opportunity driven on behalf of the clients and just when we see attractive returns. Betsy Graseck : And then it\u2019s just a ratable decline over the next five years, or it\u2019s back-end loaded? I\u2019m just thinking through how to model out the freed up capital. Martin Chavez : Yeah, I would just say it\u2019s going to be all opportunity set and return driven [indiscernible]. Betsy Graseck : Right, I get that. But the pace of the roll-off of the $6 billion if ratable over five years, or is it back-end loaded? Martin Chavez : Not really going to further break that out. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Martin Chavez : It\u2019s all going to be situational. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. Appreciate the comments and color, thank you. And thanks, Harvey, nice working with you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Martin Chavez : Hello Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning, Marty. Sorry to give you a hard time here on your first call, but the FICC question, I\u2019m still confused and I think I have some company. Your year-over-year comps were kind of easy. Last year, it was a tough one for you in FICC. I believe, as I recall, there was some market making conditions that were tricky, which certainly we can understand, but we didn\u2019t have that this quarter. Everybody else, or a lot of your [indiscernible] peers here have reported pretty solid, both quarter over quarter and year over year. I get it that commodities is a laggard, but is there anything further? Does it have to do with corporate client base being relatively smaller? Does it have to do with retaining some--holding back on some capital because you want to have dry powder for an improving environment? Is there anything further that you can add for us, please? Martin Chavez : Sure. Well, as I said, we underperformed this quarter, and the underperformance was driven by commodities and currencies. We\u2019d note that some of our competitors had bigger financing businesses and more significant corporate footprints as a result of larger lending books, but again it\u2019s one quarter and business mix differences might reflect performance, relative performance quarter to quarter, but we believe our model has lots of leverage improving client activity. Harvey, would you like to add anything? Harvey Schwartz : Well, I think Marty\u2019s covered it in pretty good detail. I mean, Brennan, I think your question is completely fair, obviously. It\u2019s nice of you to say you don\u2019t want to give Marty a hard time for the call, but I think this is--in some respects, we\u2019ve had this conversation on and off over the past four and a half years, and I think last year in the third and fourth quarter, where you might have said we outperformed, that wasn\u2019t a moment of celebration for us, and as Marty said, this isn\u2019t a moment of bigger concern for us. Quarter to quarter, things are going to vary. There may be differences in franchises, as Marty has already pointed out.  Having said that, we\u2019re pretty focused individuals over here, so to the extent of which there\u2019s any energy to harness, I can promise you we\u2019re all going to harness it. But I think Marty, I think you covered it. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks for that and the patience with whatever FICC question on it. Following up, though, on a component there, a couple years ago you guys had made the effort to try to grow out the corporate client base. Is that still an effort that you guys are focused on? Could you give maybe a high level update on where you stand there, how you\u2019re feeling about it, and maybe any updated targets or color you can give on those efforts? Martin Chavez : I\u2019ll just say that the effort to further develop that client base continues as with the client base we already have in our banking business, clearly, and the effort to be more impactful with those clients and engage them more deeply across all of our businesses continues over the long haul. I wouldn\u2019t--we don\u2019t have any particular targets. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Last one for me, so Governor Tarullo made some comments as he packed up his desk that the Volcker Rule was too complex, and while I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect that you guys would have any insights on what the regulators would come up with, if you all were sitting down or asked to provide input on what adjustments to make to the Volcker Rule, what would you propose? How would the rule look when you retain some of the benefits but then lop off some of the negative impacts to liquidity and such? Martin Chavez : So I think it makes sense to step back a bit and look at all the rule making that\u2019s occurred over the last decade or so, a little less than a decade. If you look at that, it\u2019s an impressive body of work and reduces systemic risk and contributes to safety and soundness. At the same time, looking at the approach to the rule making, the rule making proceeded in parallel along many fronts, and you mentioned one of them - the Volcker Rule, and this is happening really before the election. Regulators, for instance the Basel committee, were beginning to step back and look at the totality of the rules, look at all of them holistically and see how they interacted, and began looking at the second and third order effects, so that was happening anyway. As for the Volcker Rule itself, there could be opportunities to recalibrate, revisit parts of it. Governor Tarullo had some specific thoughts on the Volcker Rule and on other aspects of the regulatory set-up, including for instance CCAR, and it\u2019s really too early to comment. We\u2019d have to see what form that would take, but potentially there is an opportunity to reduce some of the reporting burdens around the Volcker Rule. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Martin Chavez : Morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Okay, so umpteenth question on the FICC thing, and I\u2019m just going to follow up on a comment that you made, which is we heard several times that obviously clients were less active and that has lots to do with mix, and that makes sense. But I think I also heard you say that you didn\u2019t feel like you had navigated some of the currents as effectively as you might have, and I was wondering if you could break down between the areas that you called out as having been headwinds, which were commodities, FX and, I think to a lesser extent, credit, where in particular maybe there were issues with inventory management or positioning, as opposed to just the customer flow. Martin Chavez : There\u2019s really nothing further I would add there, nothing material in inventory in the context of the firm. It\u2019s just we could have done a better job navigating the markets. It\u2019s a cyclic market and that\u2019s really all I would say. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, but I mean, it does sound like you\u2019re thinking that there were some positioning issues as opposed to it just being customer flow. Martin Chavez : No positioning issues. It\u2019s just in some market environments, one navigates a better outcome than others. That\u2019s really all I\u2019d say. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Then just changing to follow up to one of the other questions that has arisen a couple times on the comp accrual. Just trying to do a little math around it - if I take that one percentage point and I apply it to the $8 billion of revenue run rate that, as you point out, has kind of been a stable number for the last four quarters, I get a little over $300 million. Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of cost saves and think that the message you\u2019re sending is that maybe a third or so of that $900 million is on the comp line? Martin Chavez : Well, math is math. There is lots and lots of inputs to it, and some of the expense initiative was in last year and some of it was in this year. There\u2019s lots of inputs to it. There\u2019s really no message other than it\u2019s our best estimate. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, fair enough. Then just on that same point, last year you came in at 38.1% comp ratio for the full year. Martin Chavez : Yes. Guy Moszkowski : And all else equal, should we think about modeling that ratio down close to 100 basis points based on the signal that you\u2019ve sent with the reduction for 1Q, and just the thought that usually you apply that same ratio in the second quarter, or is that over-thinking it? Martin Chavez : I think there\u2019s just lots of inputs, and you\u2019ll definitely model them. It\u2019s our best estimate, and really also, as we always say, it\u2019s fundamentally at the end of the year, the comp ratio is an output. It\u2019s going to be a bottoms-up process and it will be what it is. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. Harvey, it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you and we\u2019ll miss you, but we hope you\u2019ll talk to us every once in a while. Harvey Schwartz : All the time, Guy. Thanks so much, I appreciate that. Guy Moszkowski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a follow-up on the expense side. As you mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of discussion with Tarullo talking about maybe phasing out the qualitative aspect of CCAR, simplification of Volcker. How do we think about the impact on expenses? Is that a material kind of annual thing, that if we see those things go away, that could be quite helpful, or is it something you can at least put a breadbox around for us? Martin Chavez : First of all, it was certainly his thoughts as he was ending his term and a lot of ideas, but we\u2019d have to wait to see the specifics. I wouldn\u2019t call out or break out for you any particular effect on expenses other than to say that we\u2019re strong proponents of the stress testing. It\u2019s good for the system, it\u2019s good for the firms, it\u2019s important. Jim Mitchell : So is there any particular item where you have spent the most incremental money, just so we can think about what is possible? Martin Chavez : We have since the beginning taken a holistic approach to adapting to all the rules, and we don\u2019t break it out. We just don\u2019t break it out. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. Maybe something--maybe a comment on Brexit. It seems like that\u2019s heading for more of a hard exit. How do we think about that impact for you guys? Is it very manageable, or how do you think about it? Martin Chavez : Sure. So I think not crystal clear what all the different terms around Brexit mean, including hard Brexit. Obviously it continues to evolve. We\u2019ve all seen Prime Minister May calling a snap election this morning, as we all know. The U.K. triggered Article 50 a couple weeks ago. We have our Brexit contingency plan in place, and as far as that plan is concerned, we\u2019ve taken no material actions yet along that plan, and we have a plan. Jim Mitchell : Okay, but--I guess it would just take a certain amount of moving people into--on the continent in the worst case. Is that the right way to think about it, that you already have existing offices there and the incremental expense is manageable, or no? Martin Chavez : So we have existing offices around Europe. We have existing legal entities around Europe. As you know, we conduct most of our business with EU clients who are outside of the U.K. under the passporting regime, and so much depends on what that looks like during and after the implementation period. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Martin Chavez : Good morning, Steven. Steven Chubak : So two questions, Marty, none on fixed income. I\u2019m just going to kick things off with one on asset management. We\u2019re somewhat surprised to see the management fees tick down quarter on quarter, despite what looked to be some favorable remixing in terms of the AUM, as well as just higher average assets. Was hoping you could maybe speak to some of the factors that are pressuring that managing fee yield, and also wondering whether some of the lower fee ETF offerings that you guys have, which have shown very strong growth, whether that\u2019s cannibalized fees at all. Martin Chavez : Well as you know, we\u2019re not immune to what\u2019s happening generally across the industry - fee compression of various kinds, shift in mix of strategies, and so as you also know from our results over the last year, we\u2019ve had strong inflows of long-term fee-based assets, and that has offset the modest decline in the effective fee mix. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. Just one strategy question. One of your bulge bracket competitors had recently alluded to an new initiative to expand into the self-direct retail brokerage space, and Marty, hearing your remarks about the benefits of revenue diversification, I\u2019m just wondering given your strong track record in leveraging technology expertise and your recent expansion into the retail lending space with Marcus, whether that might be an area that you could look to expand as well. Martin Chavez : So there are a lot of areas that we\u2019re always looking at as options for expansion. I wouldn\u2019t call out that one in particular, but we look at many things, and since we do have, as you mentioned, a strong tradition of building tools and applying those tools to deliver results for our clients, that\u2019s something we intend to continue. But there\u2019s nothing specific that I would call out right now. Steven Chubak : Okay, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Chavez : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Marty, I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update on what\u2019s going on with the Marcus consumer lending initiative ,so maybe you can give us a sense of where originations are now and how they\u2019re tracking relative to your firm\u2019s initial expectations of a few quarters ago. Martin Chavez : Yes, so you all know the background on Marcus. We saw an opportunity to enter into a rapidly evolving world of consumer digital finance, starting with a clean sheet of paper and focusing--engaging on thousands of consumers to see what they would be looking for in an offering, and it was clear that they wanted simplicity, transparency, flexibility, and we had no legacy either in branches or in systems, and so we saw the opportunity. Since inception, the entire concept from Marcus is a slow, deliberate, organic build-out - crawl, walk, maybe someday run. What I would say to you right now is it\u2019s executing according to the plan. Early days. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Executing according to the plan, but has the plan evolved in any way over the past few quarters based on the competitive environment, or credit or rate expectations? Martin Chavez : No, the plan, we put a lot into creating that plan, and while we\u2019re constantly looking at everything that\u2019s happening in the environment, it\u2019s the same plan and we\u2019re on plan. No material changes. Eric Wasserstrom : All right, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Marty, Harvey. How are you? Martin Chavez : Morning. How are you? Devin Ryan : Good. A question on equities trading. I know you guys have improved your electronic capabilities and increasing market share there has been a big focus. I\u2019m just curious how you feel like the investments that you\u2019ve been making are going, kind of where you are relative to where you want to be, and just how much more room you still see. Martin Chavez : So in equities, what I would say is that there is in the current results, I\u2019d point to corporate activity being strong. If you want to look at the client execution line quarter on quarter, it\u2019s really about cash and derivatives performance, and then if you\u2019re looking year-on-year, it\u2019s really about derivatives. As for our offering, as you know, it\u2019s a scale business and our clients value the diversity of services that we offer across that business - high touch, low touch, execution, as well as prime brokerage. We have over the last period seen an opportunity to have a deeper engagement with our quant fund clients, and so certainly that\u2019s a major emphasis for us and we\u2019re starting to see the results in share. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. Just one quick follow-up here on the regulatory outlook. Appreciate that you don\u2019t want to speculate on how regulation might evolve, but clearly I think one of the most difficult things kind of post-financial crisis regulation has just been the fact that it\u2019s been constantly changing and constantly evolving. So I\u2019m just curious how the current moratorium on new regulation is impacting sentiment at all internally. Essentially, is it freeing up management to focus on other business opportunities or maybe increase risk appetite to do something new? Just trying to get a sense of effectively does this moratorium actually change things, or is it all about where existing regulation goes? Martin Chavez : I would say we\u2019ve never been distracted by regulation. It\u2019s just part of the operating environment, and working with our clients, regulators, peers through the process of the rule making and the implementation is just something that we\u2019ve been doing for a long time and it\u2019s just part of how the business operates. I wouldn\u2019t call out any specific effects ongoing, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thanks very much. Martin Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. Al Alevizakos : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my single question. It\u2019s regarding fixed income and equities, however, focusing more outside the U.S. where we haven\u2019t really discussed at all. So I\u2019m just questioning what\u2019s been the performance outside the U.S., particularly in Europe but also in Asia, if you are slightly disappointed about certain product lines, and also regarding the pressure in European equities being from MiFID II. Have you actually started seeing any of that in 2017? Thank you. Martin Chavez : No, there\u2019s no particular pressure that we would attribute or notice relating to MiFID II. In terms of our business, actually the business mix across regions has remained fairly stable over time. Give or take a point, it\u2019s 60-25-15 mix across Americas, EMEA and Asia. Al Alevizakos : Thank you, and if I can have a follow-up, please, you spoke a lot about volatility being particularly low, which we witnessed as well. I\u2019m wondering whether you see any specific events in Q2 that could actually increase volatility from your point of view. I mean, obviously we see here in Europe via U.K. elections and the French elections as being significant events. Do you believe that these could actually bring the required volatility to see improved numbers in the second quarter? Martin Chavez : So certainly we\u2019re all looking at the same thing as we head into the French election next week - volatility, for instance dollar-euro has picked up significantly since intra-quarter, and we\u2019d also generally see that clarity on outcome increases the probability of action. Other than that, just I\u2019ll note, which we\u2019ve already discussed, there\u2019s often a connection between reasonable levels of volatility around market trends driving risk managers to transact. Al Alevizakos : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, good morning. A quick question. I know you\u2019ve spent or invested for the Marcus build-out as well as the bank build-out. Are both of those businesses profitable, or are they--and if they are, are the ROEs in these businesses above what you\u2019re getting from company overall? Martin Chavez : So on Marcus, it\u2019s in build mode and we\u2019re not breaking it out, other than to say that it\u2019s operating entirely according to plan. Brian Kleinhanzl : And the bank? Martin Chavez : And the bank, I would say the bank is part of our structure under our bank holding company, and the bank is performing well. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Then I know you just got done with the most recent cost save program, but do you feel like right now from a headcount perspective, you\u2019re right sized for the volumes of activity that you saw in the first quarter, if that activity level were to persist? Martin Chavez : So on that topic of expenses, we had the initiative which we shared with you and mentioned again recently, the $900 million expense initiative. On the other hand, expenses are never perfect, and keeping a close eye on our expenses is just part of the ongoing discipline of running our businesses for the clients and our shareholders. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Martin Chavez : Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all of you for joining this call. Hopefully we and other members of senior management will see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Dane; otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day and look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings call in July. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Marty? Martin Chavez : Thanks Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and first half results then I'll be happy to answer any questions. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $7.9 billion, net earnings of $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share of $3.95 and an annualized return on common equity of 8.7%. Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results, we had firmwide net revenues of $15.9 billion, net earnings of $4.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $9.10 and a return on common equity of 10.1%. As you can see, the first six months of 2017 reflected improved performance. We were able to achieve this despite what continues to be a challenging operating environment in certain businesses. Our revenues were up more than $1.6 billion or 12% compared with the first half of last year. Meanwhile expenses were up only 6% demonstrating the positive operating leverage that is embedded within our operation. Despite a difficult backdrop for our FICC business, the firm grew pretax margin by 340 basis points, versus last year and our ROE increased 260 basis points. The improvement stems from having a diversified set of leading global businesses. Weakness in FICC particularly in commodities was offset by stronger results in investing in lending, investment management and underwriting. As all of you are aware, many of the themes that we discussed during the first quarter continued into the second, rising market values and low volatility. On one hand, rising market prices were supportive of capital markets activity, investment management performance and our investing and lending activities. We recorded our third best quarterly revenue performance in debt underwriting, reflecting our multiyear effort to improve our relative positioning with our clients. Another area of strength is investment management, where we posted record management and other fees and assets under supervision and investing and lending generated $1.6 billion of revenues in the quarter with net interest income within debt securities and loans reaching more than $400 million. On the other hand, low levels of volatility sequentially lower in several fixed asset classes, negatively affected the FICC environment. The current backdrop has been particularly challenging for our FICC franchise creating headwinds in areas that are core strength of the firm. For example, we are a market leader in commodities, but it was a challenging environment on multiple fronts. In addition, our clients place significant value on the firm's long-standing commitment to market making as well as our strength in derivatives. The client activity levels understandably declined given the low volatility environment. With that as a broad overview, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion up slightly compared to the first quarter. Our investment banking backlog increased since the end of the first quarter. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the second quarter, advisory revenues were $749 million, roughly flat for the first quarter. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including C. R. Bard's $24 billion sale to Becton Dickinson. Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods and DuPont Fabros Technology's $7.6 billion merger with Digital Realty Trust. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second quarter, including Syngenta's $43.6 billion sale to ChemChina, HPE's $13.5 billion spinoff and merger of its enterprise services business with Computer Sciences and Private Bancorp's $5 billion sale to CIBC. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $981 million in the second quarter up 4% on a sequential basis. Equity underwriting revenues were $260 million down 16% quarter-over-quarter due to lower follow-on offerings. Debt underwriting revenues of $721 million reflected continued strength across all products and were up 13% relative to the first quarter. During the second quarter, we actively supported our client's financing needs participating in QUALCOMM's $11 billion bond offering in support of its acquisition of NXP. Intrum Justitia's \u20ac3 billion bond offering in support of the combination with Lindor and Banco Macro's $766 million follow-on offering. Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses; net revenues were $3.1 billion in the second quarter down 9% compared to the first quarter. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter down 31% sequentially as volatility and client conviction remained low and led to weaker client activity quarter-over-quarter. All of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter-over-quarter. Rates was down significantly. Credit, mortgages and currencies all declined. Across many of these products, volatility trended lower in the quarter and clients were less active. Commodities was also significantly lower and was our worst quarter on record. Not surprisingly given the results, it was a difficult quarter on all fronts. The market backdrop was challenged. Client activity remained light and we didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past. Nevertheless, the firm remains committed in every way to help our clients manage their commodity risk. Now moving to equities, which include equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion up 13% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $687 million were up 24% compared to first quarter due to stronger results in cash products. The business continued to operate in an environment with global equity market strength. Commissions and fees were $764 million up 4% versus the first quarter as volumes increased modestly. Security services generated net revenues of $441 million up 15% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter was $51 million down from $64 million in the first quarter, the byproduct of lower volatility levels. Moving on to our investing and lending activities collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $1.6 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion reflecting sales, corporate performance and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $396 million and as I mentioned before, included more than $400 million of net interest income. In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. This was up 2% from the first quarter, primarily as a result of higher management and other fees, which were a record for the quarter. Assets under supervision increased $33 billion sequentially to a record $1.41 trillion. The increase primarily reflected $23 billion of net inflows in connection with the acquisition of a portion of Verus Investors and $17 billion of net market appreciation. This was partially offset by net outflows in liquidity products. Now let me turn to expenses; compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 41%. This is the lowest first half accrual in our public history and a 100-basis points lower than the accrual in the first half of 2016. As we discussed last quarter, the reduction in the accrual rate reflects the completion of the nearly $900 million expense initiative that we announced last year. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.1 billion down slightly from the first quarter. Now I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,100 unchanged from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 19.1%. If you exclude the tax benefit related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the year-to-date would have been roughly 29%. Our global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $221 billion and our balance sheet and level III assets were $907 billion and $21 billion respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% under the Basel 3 advanced approach on a transitional basis and 12.2% on a fully phased-in basis. It was 13.9% using the standardized approach on a transitional basis and 13.5% on a fully phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3% and finally we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter. For the four quarters CCAR cycle for 2016, we provided shareholders with nearly $7 billion of capital through share buybacks and common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to our plan, which includes the potential for share repurchases, an increase in our common stock dividend and the issuance and redemption of capital securities. We are pleased with this outcome and believe we have flexibility to manage our capital going forward. Now for some brief summary comments. The first half of 2017 provided two important reminders. First is the value of having a leading diversified franchise. Despite a difficult first half of 2017, where one of our major businesses FICC, we posted 12% year-over-year revenue growth and a 10.1% return on common equity. In addition, we were able to produce $9.10 of earnings per diluted share. We benefited from leading positions in many of our businesses and while their relative performance may vary in any individual quarter, their collective value has been central to our outperformance over the long-term. The second reminder is the ongoing and long-term benefits associated with being a prudent manager of both cost and capital. Over the last several years, we've been looking for ways to operate more efficiently. This includes shifting our organizational footprint to different locations such as Salt Lake City where we now have more than 2,300 people. It is meant leveraging technology to improve internal productivity and find engagement. It has also meant returning more than $35 billion of capital since the beginning of 2012 and in the process creating our lowest ever share count. This has positioned the firm to provide more operating leverage to shareholders and it has also given us the capacity to make strategic investments such as markets and expand our investment management business by acquisition. Ultimately, we know that by recruiting and retaining the best people and providing our clients with the best advice and service, we are well positioned to outperform over the long-term. Our commitment to these ideal is unwavering. Thank you again for dialing in and with that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the conference call. I am happy to answer all of your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi thanks very much. Martin Chavez : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC and I think commodities is one of the things that stands out that's makes you different than the others, but maybe we could talk about the mix of clients and how much that adds to may be the differentiated performance that we're seeing meaning you see more volatility dependent right. We've talked about in the past and when VaR's low your revenue struggle more than others. Is there anything that Goldman can do to broaden the mix of both clients and products to be less volatility dependent. In the past, you had a relationship with Sumitomo that brought a bigger lending mix. I am just thinking out loud. Martin Chavez : Sure Glenn. Obviously, that's a question on our mind as well as yours and so to step back for a moment, while there are nuances and everyone's franchise is a bit different as we all know, our franchise emphasizes providing liquidity to active asset managers. So, it really isn\u2019t just a question of low volatility. It's more a sequence of low volatility, less dispersion, less client activity, reduced opportunity set and lower revenues. Also, as you mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a leading commodities business, which has a greater weight in our franchise than in other franchises. And it was a challenging backdrop for commodities really challenging on all fronts and in addition, while it was a potentially better business environment for mortgages year-on-year, we have a smaller way of mortgages in our franchise. So those are some effects that are likely there. To get to the second part of your question on actions that one can take, I can tell you that everyone in our FICC business is intensely focused on this topic and at a granular, molecular level working on it as are all of us in the leadership team. So much of it is blocking and tackling. So, in no particular order, we're looking to see where potentially there are gaps in our client coverage and onboard new clients and serve them. Also, the ongoing question in every business generally is how do we do better with the clients who are already clients of the firm. How can we cover them better? How can we have a greater impact with them? How can we provide them new solutions to their challenges and that is really an iterative process of communicating with the clients? Our business starts and ends with them and those communicating with them, coming up with new products, technologies, tools, analytics, workflows and iterating that we have on offering that is what they're looking for and that's something that we're going to continue doing and we're totally committed to it. Glenn Schorr : Maybe the related follow-up is more cyclical than that structural peace and just I guess I would scratch my head at times and say why is volatility so low like theoretically we've been waiting for this inflection 0.4. The U.S. to be off QE to start raising rates, which is different than what's going on in Europe and Asia. You've had some currency movements, some commodity. You would have through this would've been a better valuable backdrop and people would've wanted you liquidity, but it's not happening. Martin Chavez : I am sorry, I interrupted. Glenn Schorr : No, I don't know. Are we hooked on idiosyncratic events and actually these asset class moves aren't good enough? Martin Chavez : What I would say there Glenn is really on predicting when anything will be different than it is just looking back historically one year ago exactly at this time, I don't think any one of us would've predicted the strong client activity, market environment of the second half of 2016. It arrived and we had the capacity to serve our clients when they became more active on the back of any number of events happening globally. As for the environment generally, one can think of a number of possible drivers that would -- that would change the environment, some things that would potentially be supportive. The greater client activity would be of course economic growth, confidence, pro-growth policies, but ultimately our business is driven by the clients and their activities. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you. Martin Chavez : Thank you, Glenn. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Martin Chavez : Good morning, Michael. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Just one more question on the FICC side. You mentioned in terms of looking at the business and maybe some of the client gaps the market share. I guess when we look at the first half of '17 its weak and maybe commodities is a bigger part of that. But I think even in '16 when we look at the global competitors, it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged. So, I am just trying to figure out how far along to gain that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's a client, the product mix to try to diversify and broaden some of the growth opportunities? Martin Chavez : Well it's a good question and so let's go into some other effects that may be going on here and also caveated by saying that we don't have transparency into our competitor's FICC businesses, but I'll note that historically we'd had strength in derivatives and this was a weak quarter like the first quarter for derivatives. Also, it's likely that some of our competitors have bigger corporate footprints than we do as well as bigger financing footprints than we do and so while four of our business in FICC has been as I mentioned providing liquidity to active asset managers, it isn't a matter of just focusing on active asset managers and having a leading active manager franchise. It's also a question of how we can deepen our impact with the clients and have a leading cash offering as well. So, it isn't one or the other. It's a question of doing both. Similarly talking about asset managers, we can have a great asset manager franchise and a great corporate franchise and working on both. And so, this is something that all of us are evaluating and making changes and working on and we're committed to it. We know we need to do better. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities, given the combination of some of the maybe challenges on the trading side, but then also just evaluation of the stock, is there anything changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return verses reinvesting in the business, M&A activity and if there is areas I know you guys been active on the asset management side, but anything else on that front? Martin Chavez : Well just a few thoughts on CCAR. We learned a lot going through the process for a few years now and without question the process makes the industry safer and sounder. This year, the Federal Reserve's analysis showed that the 34 banks could withstand $0.5 trillion in stress losses and continue lending to the clients. It's a robust process and it's evolving every year and ultimately regulators have the authority for capital. Of course, we have our view and detailed analytics of what's the right amount of capital to hold. At various times in the past, as you know, we've resubmitted on CCAR, which is another way of saying that we believed that we had more excess capital than we could return or deploy. This year we did not resubmit and we deem it important to operate from a position of strength. I have therefore excess capital and also to have excess capital to deploy to the clients and we're ready and looking forward to increase opportunity and increase client activity and therefore more opportunities to deploy capital. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning, Marty. Martin Chavez : Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : So, you talked a lot about customer sets and just very, very low levels of volatility and activity and I think a lot of that is manifest to the market. So, we get that. That said, you've said now twice in last quarter's call and this one that you could've navigated the markets better and is that only with respect to commodities? Is that more broadly and can you just give us a little bit more color on what you mean by that? Martin Chavez : Sure, so looking at our FICC businesses as we discussed, year-on-year they all declined except for mortgages and sequentially they all declined and while there are nuances, the primary driver across most of the businesses and I'll get to commodities in a moment, the primary driver for the decline sequentially or year-on-year was lower client activity with all the drivers that we discussed, lower volatility, less dispersion, less opportunity set. Commodities as a story of challenges on all fronts and there it was lower client activity and also a difficult market-making environment as you know in market-making if I could use for a moment a store analogy though is more complex than the typical store, our clients we need to have in our store that the clients are seeking and we need to have a capacity to create the products that the clients are seeking and sometimes clients are also selling us products they go into the store, which is maybe different from a typical store. And all of this is happening in a dynamic market environment where the value of all the products in the store is moving up and down and so managing that central problem of risk management in a market-making business requires choices and art and science and it's an uncertain process and you can make the choices and have less than good outcomes. And so that's what I mean when I say it's challenging market environment and also, we didn't navigate the markets and making those choices as well as we -- as well as we want to and as well as we typically have. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then turning the page to equities, which we haven't really talked about much, but where you actually had a pretty meaningful improvement relative to both of the reference quarters and looking in particular at the customer execution. Are you starting to see some of the benefits of the investments that you've made in quant-oriented products? Did you just have a very successful period in terms of equity derivatives despite the fact that VaR wasn't greatly. Actually, you said, cash products and it doesn\u2019t sound like it was that, maybe you can just give us a little bit more color for how you saw such a significant increase in execution results? Martin Chavez : Guy, I would be very happy to go into some significant detail on our equities business. As you mentioned it was an environment of higher equity prices and low volatility and then you asked the questions why is this -- how is this different and I would note several things. First, our volume held up rather well and you can see that in the commission line, which we break out. Then looking at the equities client execution line and you referenced this, we had a better cash results globally and beyond the U.S. we had better cash and derivatives results. And we noticed our market share going up not just with our active manager client, but also the passive managers as for providing capital and equities client execution we observed increased demand around a variety of events. The European elections also as we noticed last year around the Brexit referendum in addition as it relates to equities client execution we observed a normalization in the markets in Asia. And to get to another part of your question we are observing the positive results of investing over multiple quarters in both execution and in and in capital commitment and then in addition I would note corporate activity remained healthy and is typically not correlated with the activity of the active manager clients. And so, I\u2019m referencing all of these because they're all interesting and useful observations and notions that we can apply in our other businesses. For example, in the fixed business we've already begun applying some of these and for instance U.S. corporate credit and now our extending it to Europe and into our other businesses. Guy Moszkowski : So perfect. And just one more from me which is sort of part question part observation on the CCAR results. If the question is would you ever consider changing your policy to tell us what you were approved for like most of your peers do -- all your peers do. I think analyst investors are grown up enough to understand it's not a commitment that it's just an approval. But the observation part of it is I just don't think you\u2019re doing yourself any favors by not telling us? Martin Chavez : Well I appreciate you\u2019re sharing that observation Guy and I\u2019m not going to make a prediction about what we will or won't do in the future. Obviously, we do think about this a lot and we have observed that the other banks who went through the CCAR process disclosed their authorizations. We just see it as such dynamic process and as you said it's not a commitment and we know you understand that nevertheless because it's an authorization and were constantly reevaluating it we haven't disclosed it and that's where we are. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Hart with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Jeff Hart : Hey, good morning. My question is more on a macro level as we\u2019re looking at potential LCR and SLR easing. I\u2019m kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR/SRL easing could potentially increase the financing available to clients and therefore kind of boost trading volumes overall market activity. But I guess I'm kind of looking back at 2Q 2014 we got the final SLR rule and we saw your repo book really kind of decline that quarter. How much would easing there help overall trading activities \u2013 kind of attracting trading activities as opposed to just helping Goldman Sachs I mean give a feel for how big an impact that had in your trading businesses back in 2Q 2014? Martin Chavez : Oh sure, it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ll just step back for a moment to observe the executive order and then the treasury report that followed it which I know all of us I have reviewed. There is order of 100 recommendations in that report as you know. And about two-thirds of them roughly our activities that the regulators could undertake that don't require legislative authorization and the report did get a bit more specific on the ratios that you mentioned are particularly SLR and there's certainly been a lot of commentary and research out of the market about what changes to the SLR might create in terms of capacity. And there's many views on this as you know SLR was the most binding metrics for us this year it was the first time that it was incorporated into the CCAR process although as to how the CCAR process will evolve with stress capital buffers and other proposals, but it\u2019s really not knowable. We also note and you know that various regulators have expressed different views on recalibration for instance Governor Powell was broadly in favor and the Chairman of the FDIC Mr. Gruenberg not so. And so, I wouldn't want to speculate too much beyond saying that if the treasury report\u2019s recommendations were to be adopted by the regulators and as I said that's not knowable right now, but if it were potentially a recalibration such as that might change the way that we think about our prime brokerage business and the matchbook business. But as for how that will show up in client activity and revenues there's many inputs to client activity and this is just one. Jeff Hart : If I mean \u2013 has the availability of financing the kind of active trading accounts been a meaningful deterioration I guess maybe problem over the last couple of years. Martin Chavez : I wouldn't say it's a problem it's just we\u2019re continuously evolving and responding to the regulatory environment capital plan it\u2019s a planning processes it\u2019s complex, it\u2019s nonlinear it\u2019s changing and not sure that that any of this has really much of an affect on whether there are alpha opportunities for the active managers. Jeff Hart : Okay thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hey good morning. Martin Chavez : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions just one you mentioned in our prepared remarks that some of what you think you'll be doing or focusing on as an organization is just play no blocking and tackling could you just give a sense as to what you mean by that I have my own views but I wanted to understand what you meant by that? Martin Chavez : Sure, so blocking and tackling is actually a very broad topic and a lot of this is just what any business would do. It's our people across the firm at all levels of seniority meeting with clients. There is no substitute for going to visit clients and talking with them and understanding their objectives, their benchmarks, their challenges things that are working for them, things that are not, understanding how they see the value that we\u2019re adding to them whether it's in liquidity provision or other services. Understanding ways in which we can have a better engagement with them and for instance a topic that we've been working on for some time now ways of extending and sharing our analytics and data with them as a way of bringing them the relationship strengthening the relationship and leading potentially to more activities. So, there is certainly just this aspect of that\u2019s constantly changing because the client needs and requirements are changing for risk management products and services and the format, the package, the way in which they want those services delivered and the only way to know about that is to work with the clients at various levels front, middle and back across the client organization, engage with them and iterate. We've done this in other businesses as I just mentioned we've seen the fruits of doing this and for instance are equities business which is led to new offerings over the last few years but it's really something that applies very broadly across our businesses. And investment banking a few years ago we identified an opportunity to do better with our clients and to cover more clients and debt capital markets. And you\u2019ve seen the results of that multiyear effort in our league table rankings and in our revenues in investment management, the opportunity to provide holistic solutions to clients for instance CIO outsourcing on and to deliver that organically as well as through acquisitions. And so that's an example and really, we see all of these approaches and techniques as applying very broadly across all our businesses and there is a huge emphasis in doing that in our FICC business as well. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. And then just separately switching gears to Marcus, there's been some contrary I think Lloyd and others have talked about, the take a rate that you've had. Could you give us a sense of progression from here, are you looking for the same level of growth that you've been able to generate and how much over the course of the next couple of years do you anticipate taking your risk capital and applying it to utilizing in Marcus? Martin Chavez : So, as you know with Marcus, we saw an opportunity not the very long ago given our market position, our strength in technology and analytics and that fact that we didn't have bricks-and-mortar branches or legacy systems or credit card and just looking at all of the activity in this burgeoning world of digital consumer finance, we saw an opportunity. And we put together deliberate methodical organic plan. Lloyd mentioned some of our progress according to that plan where we crossed the billion-dollar threshold in loan balances and this customer centric plan is progressing and we're executing according to plan. We don't have loan balance targets and we're excited about this business and believe that it can generate high-teen ROEs. Just stepping back, like to take a minute to put Marcus in a broader context of all the ways that we're seeking and delivering growth opportunities for the firm. First one is the market, another one is expanding the franchise, another would be improving our relative positioning and then also new products and opportunities even in our mature competitive market such as banking, institutional client services, investment management there is opportunities to close market share gaps, improve the client mix, do better with the clients and we've taken purposeful op actions to make that happen. There is in the area of the consumer a number of new opportunities that we're evaluating including Marcus which is the first example and an opportunity to leverage our strong brand into areas beyond our traditional franchise and Marcus is one such greenfield opportunity where we don't need a leading market share for it to be a significant opportunity for us. Betsy Graseck : And then last, does it help with CCAR at all? Martin Chavez : I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that, I didn\u2019t hear that. Betsy Graseck : The markets revenue stream, the NII associated with it, does that help at all with CCAR there an opportunity to improve the optionality in the capital structure by having this type of revenue stream come through? Martin Chavez : I think it's a little too early to answer you on that when Betsy. Marcus really isn't - it's not a material NII story at this point its really much more return on attributed equity story and as you know CCAR is included constantly evolving process. Betsy Graseck : Sure. Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking the question. I got a follow-up on FICC. So, you spoke to the market making and issues of setting risk book but just wanted to dig in a little because sequentially bar is down for you guys but yet stable at many of your money center competitors which I would think should normalize for market volatility. So, could you square those two factors going on? Did something happen where early on the market making difficulties you ran into were early on in the quarter and then you guys cut back a bit on the balance sheet that's what lead to the bar decline versus peers sequentially? How do that all shake outer or any increase color will be helpful? Martin Chavez : Everyone's approach to bar in the way in which people incorporate bar into the businesses is different. We don't have bar targets and bar is an output of client\u2019s activity, client demand for capital as we discussed and as you noted it declined from $64 million to $51 million sequentially, so call it 20% and looking across the product areas, really, it's lower volatility as the main driver in currencies, there's a bit of a positional driver in addition to the ball driver. And then also there is a diversification effect so there was increased correlation and just the change in the bar as its measured in the different product areas but led to a change in diversification effect so that was a small contribution to bar. But really, it's not a matter of cutting it back. It's just a matter of - there was less client demand for the bar capacity. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then another follow-up here on the commodity comments that you made earlier. So, a few years ago, Goldman disclosed to breakdown of your FICC business with commodities being roughly 8% of ICS revenues. It seems as though your commentary suggests that that has increased in recent years. Can you give us a sense about how large you think on average that's trended over the last couple of years versus this several years ago disclosure at this point? Martin Chavez : So, I would just observe that out of the 73 quarters that we've been a public company, it was the worst quarter for the commodities business and we don't break out further - the contribution of the individual product lines. There is a lot of reasons for that but really, we just think of it as a business that serves the clients holistically across a number of different products. And that's where I\u2019ll leave it. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Is it possible just to clarify a bit here. Was it - given it's a worst commodities quarter on record, does that mean that it might have actually even been in - there could've been a negative revenue figure or was it positive or is that something you can't disclose? Martin Chavez : I'll just say we don't disclose the product break-out. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Worth a shot. Thanks Marty. Martin Chavez : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe a question on the derivatives bigger picture. You guys always had superior risk management that enables you to be kind of top market share in derivatives. But I guess the question is then, how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when you have greater transparency in the markets you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers and passives and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets. At what point I guess do you start to rethink that business and your advantage in the business or was it something, hey, we just have to maintain our top market share and hopefully it comes back. Just, how are you thinking about the response to any - I guess continue pressure in that business relative to the peer group? Martin Chavez : Sure. It\u2019s a great question. So just to one micro point that you made on exchange versus OTC, I'll note that that it's often the experience that they really - if they might seem like there and our position to one another. But often there's actually a virtuous cycle where the availability on exchange liquidity actually makes it easier for market makers to make markets and OTC products, therefore hedging more on exchanges so it's a virtuous cycles. So, I wouldn't necessarily see those in our position. As for derivatives versus cash, again it wouldn't see it as one or the other why not why not both and of course we're going to continue investing in our historical strength in derivatives and stay with our clients over the long term not just in the quarters where there are extremely active. But I\u2019ll just note that as or product formatter or package right there, there's so many different formats and they are constantly evolving right. So for a particular kind of risk, you could have futures, derivatives, cash, systematic trading strategies, ETFs, and it just goes on and on, and really as opposed to attempting to predict which product format is going to be appealing to the client, I think that would be really brittle to have a prediction and move everything in that direction and really the way we're seeing it, the way we see generally everything is preparing the firm to respond to a variety of different market states and a variety of different client needs. And so, if the clients are in some period of time and it could be - secular could be cyclical doesn't it doesn't matter who knows if the clients are looking for cash solutions, then building strength in cash solutions is part of what will do. We have experienced and I\u2019ll just note, the equities business is one example of defining commissions and commissions are at a small fraction in the equities business of where they were, say 15 years ago and that has not been an optical to constantly evolving the business and finding new ways to serve the clients and I expect that kind of learning and things we've learned and observed in our U.S. corporate credit business to be a valuable observations that we can extend to all of our businesses. Jim Mitchell : That makes sense. Just maybe one quick follow on that. Just, do you think there is a correlation in say hedge fund clients' willingness to take on leverage in the derivatives markets. Is it correlated you think with sort of flows like their desire to stay more liquid and therefore don't want to take on say more illiquid assets like derivatives and that's something we should be watching to see an inflection there. How do you think about what is driving their decision-making process? Martin Chavez : There you know would be tough to speculate on their thought process. Of course, we talk to them and all the time and what they're telling us is that this whole backdrop of lower volatility, less dispersion, leads to less conviction and a lower opportunity set for them and for us. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Fair enough, thanks. Martin Chavez : Thanks Jim. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey Marty. So, I had a follow-up question on the line discussion on derivatives. There was a report that was published a few years ago by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, which show that derivatives actually contributed more than 50% of your fee revenue. And giving the impact that weaker derivatives had on results this quarter and recognizing as you notice, there are lot of different derivative product formats we need to think through. How is that mix evolved in recent years and how should we expect that to project longer-term? Martin Chavez : So, great question Steven, I\u2019ll just note that we don't really - while of course we have all kinds of analytics, we don't really break out the business in that particular way. We have noted that that ratio between cash and derivatives, for example in the rates business just to give one example, where there is for instance stock data repositories, and there is other data sources. It seems there is more activity really across the industry in the product format of T-bills in future but of course swaps - old swap continue to be a hugely important part of that business. Again, I'll just go back to what I mentioned which is something we believe profoundly which is that we go where the clients lead us and of course it's iterative, we have ideas for new products and solutions and we work on that with the clients and we see if it fits their needs and we evolve from there and we plan for a variety of different outcomes. So is there a trajectory on more derivatives versus cash in the future or less, that's really not how we think about it. It's much more a matter of being prepared to offer the clients both and it's become increasingly much more dynamic and just that kid of dichotomy of cash or derivatives. There's product formats that are being created really all the time and having the capability and capacity to operate across products and across different kinds of product format, it's caught our franchise. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one follow-up for me on the discussion on the treasury white paper and the SLR in particular. We and many of our clients are going to the exercise of trying to assess the cumulative benefits that could accrete to you as well as many your peers. And you noted that the SLR and CCAR appears to be your binding constraint today. But will the constraint that appears to be nearly as binding is the 4% Tier 1 leverage in CCAR? And didn't know if you had any thoughts just to whether you anticipate that in a similar vein or fashion that CCAR would be applied to that measure as well or how you're thinking about binding this in the event that you get some of those reforms as outlined by the treasury pushed through? Martin Chavez : Well, it's a great question Steven. I would say that we don't really other than the observation which you can see on the Fed's website that SLR was binding this year, we don't really - I don't think it would be useful to call out a particular rule. There is - as we look at the way, the rules written, they are having a powerful effect on systemic safety and soundness and even before the election and the executive order and the treasury report, regulators were already beginning to step back and look at the totality of the rules and see all the ways that they interact. Just as one example, Governor Tarullo gave a very thoughtful speech on stress capital buffer concept as a possible evolution of CCAR. We don't know when or if that concept will appear in CCAR but interestingly that approach links capital returns, balance sheet, risk-weighted assets, bought and stressed ratios really in a manner that is very aligned with how we think about capital planning and all of these metrics and feed into one another and there's an interplay. So, I don't think it would be useful to speculate on any one metric other than to say, we do, we build analytics, models, processes and we set ourselves up so that we can respond to the client in a variety of different regulatory and market scenarios. Steven Chubak : Thanks Marty. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Marty. I don't know if I heard you correctly and I apologize ahead of time but when you're talking about the FICC business, obviously customer behavior and markets the lack of volatility was a contributor to the week number in FICC but I think you also said you weren't as happy about your navigating or your company is navigating in the markets. If that is - if I heard it correctly, how much of the downturn was due to the customers versus your own trading capabilities and how does that compared to the first quarter when you compare the two? Martin Chavez : I think to go back to that store analogy, there is - well it would be - maybe a wonderful utopian thing to be able to operate the two and say one is client activity and one is when it navigating the markets. There really interwoven and so in making prices to clients, they want to buy so we sell, they want to sell so we buy. There's choices there and then in the strategies that we employ to manage the resulting basis risk, this strategy is there and we step back in and at the end observe the results. And it was a comment that I really wanted to make very particularly about the commodities business. As for the rest of the FICC businesses, it really was a story of lower client activity very good. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and then coming back to the investment banking pipelines, can you give us more color geographically or industry strategic versus financial. What are you guys seeing in that pipeline? Martin Chavez : Sure, so it \u2013 I look at the backlog and really, it's driven primarily by underwriting but looking at banking broadly I would say the CEOs are confident, the conversations are happening all the time and strategic M&A in the U.S. those discussions are occurring especially in technology and consumer retail in natural resources in Europe. I would say it's hard to predict given the Brexit uncertainty there is healthy activity and we certainly see opportunities in Europe for debt underwriting. In Asia, we're still seeing the trend of Chinese buying and international assets. And we remain optimistic over the long-term and as for the debt markets again no predictions here other than to note what we all know which is that trends in rates, and spread and volatility in M&A activity all drive demand for issuance. And even though rates have moved up overall financing tasks are still quite low by historical standard. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just finally, can you guys give us any additional color on the treasury's proposal for retrofitting the Volcker rule just how you guys are seeing as it involves? Martin Chavez : Again, I would say there is the treasury's proposal and there is discussion about how Volcker might evolve as it relates both to market making as well as to the Volcker covered funds. I wouldn't make any specific comment on how Volcker might evolve other than to observe and with the regulators, multiple regulators have talked about this publicly. They\u2019re taking opportunities to step back and potentially recalibrate what I would say is that as and when this recalibration occurs we'd expect the regulations to continue to be thoughtful, to protect the system and at the same time to support growth and well-functioning market. Gerard Cassidy : Really appreciate it. Thank you, Martin. Martin Chavez : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. Al Alevizakos : Hi Martin, thank you for taking my questions. My question is basically we talked a lot about equities and obviously the performance is very strong particularly after I think the relative underperformance in Q1. And I wanted to actually touch on the equity capital markets on ECM I was surprised because the figure was actually weaker than I was expecting. And it was coming off a weakest Q2, 2016. And I also believe that the biologic numbers were pointing up overall materially for the quarter. So, would you mind telling me if there was something special where all you think like it was kind of one-off that\u2019s going to be reversed in Q3? Martin Chavez : That\u2019s a great question, so as you noted year-to-date our volumes are strong and outperforming and of course the quarter is important and useful and standard are construct. And at the same time \u2013 it can also be relatively arbitrary boundary. But working within that boundary sequentially they were lower follow-ons. And year-over-year lower converts and as for the drivers of the revenue results as they think from the volume results it's something that is a very complicated output. There is audio break where one can get conflicted out sometimes in smaller deals. There is actually fewer underwriters and as you know everyone is part of the league table, but at least your underwriters, there's fewer things to share among and so there is a lot of effect going on there as for what the actual drivers are. As we always do we'll look into it and respond. Al Alevizakos : Great. And if I can turn your attention into the I&L division. You've already spoken about the NII strength. And you said that the figure is more around US$400 million. I'm just trying to get a feeling on the recurring part that relates to your increased lending through corporate and private banking versus the standard kind of one-off interest that's coming from your equity investments. Could you kind of give us an indication whether you start seeing more and more recurring NII shift in the division? Martin Chavez : Well, looking at I&L portfolio, right now it stands at just over $106 billion and that's almost $4 billion increase sequentially and 79% of that is lending. On that NII figure that we quoted more than $400 million that is recurring. Al Alevizakos : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Martin Chavez : Welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Thanks Marty. So, couple of quick questions here. On the deposit front, I know you've been growing and kind of consumer I guess we'll call those consumer deposits and I know that everyone has been growing markets that much. So, what other businesses are being funded by those deposits? Martin Chavez : I am sorry, I didn't hear the last part of the question. Could you say that again Brian please? Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah, which other businesses are utilizing that deposit funding? Are you supporting I&L? Martin Chavez : All right. Sorry, yes. So, well our private wealth management business is an example of one of those businesses as of the first quarter is about $29 billion of loans and commitments to our private wealth management clients and that's up about $1 billion sequentially. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. And have you seen any specific impact from MiFID II on your overall businesses both in equity and FICC that play a role in the results this quarter? Martin Chavez : I would say it's significant certainly in terms of the effort across our businesses and really as you know MiFID II is an extremely broad undertaking, arguably broader than for instance the U.S. regulatory changes since the crisis. I would just call out a couple of major areas of MiFID II. So, on execution services as that evolves we're staying close to the clients and then as for research, it's crucial we believe to continue to provide differentiated strong content into the scale player with differentiated content that the client's value. Potentially there is some mind share impact because this is a big list across the industry with a singular go live date in early January of next year, but as for whether there is a long-term impact, it's too early to assess. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Martin Chavez : Well first I would like to thank all of you for calling in. I've met many of you and I look forward to getting to meet all of you in person. If you have any additional questions please don't hesitate to call Dane and I wish you all a great summer. Thank you.

This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. Our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firm\u2019s results. Marty? Marty Chavez : Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I\u2019ll walk you through the third quarter and the year-to-date results; then, I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions. In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $8.3 billion, net earnings of $2.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $5.02 and an annualized return on common equity of 10.9%. Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results. We had firm-wide net revenues of $24.2 billion, net earnings of $6.2 billion, earnings per diluted share of $14.11 and a return on common equity of 10.3%. Year-to-date, our firm-wide revenues are up 8% or $1.8 billion versus the same period last year, reflecting a broad contribution across most of our businesses. Revenue strength in investment banking and investment management helped to offset weaker FICC performance. Our investing and lending activities posted strong performance, driven by the quality of our portfolio, increasing asset prices and the ongoing expansion of our lending and financing footprint. We are committed to expanding our global client franchise and correspondingly our revenue production, despite the challenging operating environment. As Harvey discussed at a recent conference, we had detailed plans across each of our businesses to drive stronger client relationships and shareholder value creation in the current operating environment. With more than $5 billion of revenue opportunities identified, we are executing across those multiple plans. As it relates specifically to this quarter\u2019s performance, revenues increased 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. A year-over-year increase is particularly noteworthy, given the strength of our performance in the third quarter of 2016. Importantly, our emphasis on cost efficiency and commitments to operating leverage for our shareholders continued into the third quarter. These efforts have positioned the firm to accrue a compensation-to-net revenue ratio of 40% for the year-to-date, down 100 basis points versus this point last year. As a result of revenue growth and expense discipline, our pre-tax earnings are up 16% to $8 billion and our ROE is 160 basis points higher at 10.3% for the first nine months of the year. With that as a broad overview, let\u2019s now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of $1.8 billion, up 4% compared to the second quarter including strong results in advisory. Our investment banking backlog decreased since the end of the second quarter as replenishment of M&A transactions was lower. Breaking down the components of investment banking in the third quarter, advisory revenues were $911 million, up 22% compared to the second quarter as deal closings accelerated. Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranks first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the third quarter including Worldpay\u2019s merger with Vantiv for a combined enterprise value of $28.8 billion, CVC\u2019s 5.8 billion euro sale of its majority stake in Ista to Cheung Kong Property Holdings and Home Shopping Network\u2019s $2.6 billion sale to Liberty Interactive. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the third quarter including, DuPont\u2019s combination with Dow Chemical and a $130 billion merger of equals; Baker Hughes\u2019 $32 billion merger with GE Oil & Gas, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $8.8 billion spinoff and merger of non-core software assets with Micro Focus International. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $886 million in the third quarter, down 10% on a sequential basis. Equity underwriting revenues were $212 million, down 18% quarter-over-quarter as IPO volumes declined. Debt underwriting revenues of $674 million included strong acquisition finance activity. Results were down 7% relative to a very robust second quarter. Year-to-date Goldman Sachs ranked 1st in worldwide common-stock offerings, and also had a leading position in leveraged finance. During the third quarter, we actively supported our clients\u2019 financing needs participating in Amazon\u2019s $16 billion debt offering to support its purchase of Whole Foods; Japan Post\u2019s $10.8 billion follow-on offering; and Discovery Communications\u2019 $6.3 billion bond offering to support its purchase of Scripps Networks. Turning to institutional client services, which comprises both our FICC and equities businesses, net revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter, up 2% compared to the second quarter, reflecting a recovery in FICC performance. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 25% sequentially. While volatility and client conviction remained low, improvements across all of our businesses aided performance. Following a more challenging second quarter, rates improved significantly amid better U.S. economic data and expectations for central bank actions. Commodities posted a modest improvement sequentially. Despite the increase, third quarter results still represented a bottom decile performance. Credit improved given better performance in our financing solutions business. Mortgages and currencies were up modestly quarter-over-quarter. Now moving to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.7 billion, down 12% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $584 million were down 15% compared to the second quarter. There was a limited opportunity set in derivatives, and low volatility weighed on results. Commissions and fees were $681 million, down 11% versus the second quarter, as U.S. volumes decreased industry-wide. Security services generated net revenues of $403 million, down 9% sequentially, reflecting typical second quarter seasonality. Balances were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter and funding spreads remained relatively tight, given the close to 90% of our stock borrowed for clients were in very liquid collateral. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the third quarter was $47 million, down from $51 million in the second quarter, driven by lower commodity price risk. Moving on to our investing and lending activities, collectively these businesses produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.4 billion, reflecting sales, corporate performance, and gains in public equity investments. Of the $1.4 billion, roughly 60% was driven by public mark-to-market and events such as sales. Given the favorable market backdrop, we\u2019ve been actively harvesting our portfolio. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $492 million and included approximately $450 million of net interest income. With respect to the I&L balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $116 billion in total assets. Given our continued efforts to expand our lending footprint, loans receivable were the biggest growth driver, up $8 billion quarter-over-quarter to $61 billion. In investment management, we reported third quarter net revenue of $1.5 billion, flat with the second quarter. Assets under supervision increased $50 billion sequentially to a record $1.46 trillion. The increase primarily reflected $13 billion of long-term net inflows, $14 billion of liquidity product net inflows and $23 billion of net market appreciation. Now, let me turn to expenses. As mentioned earlier, compensation and benefits expense for the year to date which include salary, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits was accrued at a compensation to net revenues ratio of 40%. This is 100 basis points lower than the accrual in the first nine months of 2016. Third quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, up 2% from the second quarter. Now, I\u2019d like to take you through a few key statistics for the third quarter. Total staff was approximately 35,800, up 5% from the second quarter and reflected seasonal hiring. Our effective tax rate for the year to date was 22.6%. If you exclude the tax benefits related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the year to date would have been roughly 29%. Our global core liquid assets ended the third quarter at $220 billion and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $930 billion and $21 billion, respectively. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 12% under the Basel III advanced approach on a transitional basis and 11.7% on a fully phased-in basis. It was 13.3% using the standardized approach on a transitional basis and 13% on a fully phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.1%. Increased lending and derivative exposures drove declines in the advanced and standardized ratios whereas the SLR was lower sequentially given increases in the balance sheet. And finally, we repurchased 9.6 million shares of common stock for $2.2 billion in the quarter. On the subject of CCAR, we extensively engaged with our shareholders to solicit views on potential disclosure. Not surprisingly, we got different perspectives on the topic. It is clear at this point that we are the only CCAR bank that hasn\u2019t disclosed. Accordingly, we are disclosing our 2017 CCAR buyback authorization of $8.7 billion. Of course, the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our capital plan is similar to authorizations we received from our Board and our shareholders; it is limit, not a requirement. We will determine our share repurchases in connection with the opportunities and risks that are present in the market. This includes but is not limited to the $5 billion of revenue opportunities we recently presented on. To close, let me spend a moment on the $5 billion of growth initiatives. They incorporate opportunities from across our global franchise including investment banking, FICC, equities, investment management and lending. The breadth of these opportunities demonstrates the growth potential of each of our businesses. Client feedback continues to be quite positive; and importantly, there is tremendous energy internally around these initiatives. We believe successful completion of these opportunities would drive an incremental $2.5 billion in annual pretax earnings at a 30% marginal ROE. We look forward to updating you on these initiatives as they evolve. And you should have confidence that the full capacity and capability of this firm is concentrated on delivering on these and other initiatives. Before we move on to Q&A, I want to thank Dane Holmes. As you probably know, Dane will become the firm\u2019s new Global Head of Human Capital Management in January. He has been a trusted advisor to me and we are all excited about his new role and his continued ability to drive positive outcomes for the firm and our people. We also want to welcome back Heather Miner as the new Head of Investor Relations. Many of you will know Heather from her eight years in IR previously. We both look forward to maintaining an active dialogue with our shareholders and the analyst community. With that, I want to thank you again for dialing in, and I am happy to answer all of your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, the balance sheet keeps growing in I&L and it keeps producing, so God bless. A question on the debt side. How much do you think of that balance sheet is relationship lending versus straight investment versus more of an asset management like revenue? And of that $450 million in NII, do you still feel like 400 is about the quarterly run rate, given current balance sheet? Marty Chavez : Well, Glenn, so let\u2019s go through the lending part of the I&L portfolio. There is, as we said, $61.5 billion of loans receivables held for investment, and that figure increased $7.5 billion on the quarter. And so, looking into the components of that increase, I would say $1 billion of that is related to increased lending in our private wealth management business, and then $5 billion of it as a broad category, we will call it corporate and relationship, and that includes project financing, financing for asset managers, relationship lending, mortgage warehousing. When we think about the net interest income and are investing in lending line; that has grown significantly over time, and we see it as a stable and growing revenue source. Glenn Schorr : And your comments on capital ratios and SLR, do they constrain your ability to continue to do this? You mentioned your buyback is pretty darn big. Should we be thinking those as trade-offs, or can you do both? Marty Chavez : So, based on regulatory constraints, as you know from the CCAR results, we do not have significant access today, and CCAR has been our binding constraint. Well, as you know, the test evolves. And so, we don\u2019t know how the test will evolve. But, based on our own assessment of risk, we have significant access, and that gives us the capacity to support the clients. And so, we will continue with the approach that we\u2019ve always had, which is for these capital decisions to remain dynamic with the top priority being -- having strong capital and liquidity to support the clients and to support our growth. You\u2019ve gotten used to the return and we have as well, and we have been through a period of retuning capital, implementing the regulations, all good for systemic safety and soundness. But, we have pivoted to growth. And based on the opportunities that we\u2019ve been outlining to the market, we would certainly prefer deploying our capital resources to support these 30% and ahead of 30% marginal ROEs, we prefer that to buying back our shares. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. One last small one, acquisition of Genesis Capital in the quarter, commercial lender, could you talk about where that fits in? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, the Genesis is similar in the businesses that we\u2019ve been doing for a considerable period of time in our investment management business. And so, the loans fit within all of our risk parameters and we saw an opportunity for accretive returns, plugging it into our platform and our control and saw the opportunities as to grow it by plugging it into our platform. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning, Marty. Maybe first question, just on investment banking, the results came in strong, you mentioned on the M&A side some deals closing and then, you also just mentioned the pipeline down, just any context around that? Because I think on the equity side, it seems like the IPO pipeline is strong, so just maybe any color on the M&A front? And then, given that tax reform is a bit more in that line, just any change or change in the number of conversations in different industries, if we get that as a potential catalyst heading into 2018 or 2019? Marty Chavez : So, as I mentioned, Mike, the backlog is down sequentially and down year-to-date, and that\u2019s just natural side effect of the strong closings that we had in the third quarter; some of those deals had actually been in the backlog for a couple of quarters. And so, I won\u2019t distinguish the formal backlog from the pipeline. The pipeline, as you noted in equity underwriting is strong also in our conversations with clients on the advisory side. There\u2019s no sense of slowdown. We\u2019re seeing a pickup in client dialogue, particularly I would note in technology, media, telecom, as well as industrials and natural resources. And so, it\u2019s strong for all of the reasons that you would expect that CEOs are confident, equity market support valuations and acquisition currencies, the financing markets are open, the overall levels of financing costs are relatively low by historical standards. That\u2019s all constructive on tax reform which you also mentioned, that is certainly a part of our engagement with clients. And I will also note however that clients, it seems to us, have moved towards saying, well, tax reform would be a good thing but it\u2019s not stopping us from considering strategic acquisitions and sales right now. Mike Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, MiFID II is on the horizon heading into 2018. I know, there\u2019s still a lot of shifting strategies in the industry, in conversations, but any kind of indication on how you think that impacts on the industry and you guys, either from a research standpoint, trading standpoint or market share? Marty Chavez : Sure, I\u2019ll go through all of them. First, I would start by saying that it\u2019s our view that the MiFID II impact will mean that it\u2019s critically important to have not only differentiated content but also scale and a global reach, all of which we have in our businesses. And so, just going through the various aspects of it, as you know it\u2019s a significant effort and there is a big bank\u2019s go-live date in early January. On the execution side and staying close to our clients, understanding the liquidity provision, execution capabilities that they need and designing them, we have the software, we have the people, and so we are working on all of that and that is progressing. On the research side, again, it\u2019s important to have that differentiated content and the breadth of research, and the conversations about the price discovery for the research product are progressing. And in our asset management business, we and several other asset managers have recently disclosed our intent to pay for research. There\u2019s ongoing discussions we understand between the SEC and the European regulators that may lead to some form of release. So, we are following those closely. But to put it all together, again, the emphasis is -- MiFID II is going to make it even more important than it\u2019s ever been, and it\u2019s always been important to have scale and depth and breadth, and I wouldn\u2019t trade our franchise with anyone else. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. You mentioned a little bit of detail within the loan growth this quarter on an earlier question. But, I guess just bigger picture, what kind of goalpost will you be providing to us on the $5 billion of revenue targets, as we think out the next couple of years here? Marty Chavez : So, on the $5 billion of revenue targets, it\u2019s important to emphasize again that they don\u2019t depend on any improvement in the underlying market conditions or any change in regulation. Of that $5 billion opportunity that we are pursuing over the next three years, $2 billion of it -- $2 billion of the revenue opportunity annually relates to lending. And we called out in our discussions in September the various parts of that market, which we\u2019ve talked about are private wealth management business, GS Select, institutional lending of various kinds. And internally, as you would expect, we\u2019ve had growth initiatives since forever, and you\u2019ve seen some of the results of those, whether it\u2019s in asset management or in our debt underwriting business or growing our asset management business. And so, we have considerable experience and are putting time and energy into the frameworks, the tracking and the measurements of the milestones, and the resources that we are putting against those milestones. And we will of course give you regular updates as these opportunities materialize over the next three years. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I appreciate the added disclosure, I wasn\u2019t sure everybody did on the CCAR here, and I would just throw out there I think improved disclosure on these initiatives over time, as they take hold, especially the lending and maybe some more breakout effect I think over time would be helpful. You gave the commentary around it but I think having some numbers around as well would be helpful. Marty Chavez : Well, we definitely are taking that on and going back to what we described in September, there is a breakdown, various aspects of the revenue opportunity as well as balance sheet and capital against it. And so, we will absolutely be having a continuous dialogue with you on that as we progress. Operator : Your next is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Q - Mike Mayo : Can you talk about the potential for reduced regulatory cost, if there is deregulation? And I\u2019m not really asking about risk appetite or how you might change with that but really just overhead cost to comply with regulations today, and what it could be in the future? Marty Chavez : So, Mike, we, like all of us in the industry, are noting the various treasury reports for instance, the recommendations. We\u2019ve seen some progress against the recommendations of the first treasury report, for instance. To give just the couple of examples, the OCC has asked for a perspective on the Volcker rule. There has been some news from Basal committee on net stable funding ratio and there are few other examples as well. And so, we are seeing that. And certainly some of the U.S. regulators have been very specific in their discussions about simplifying some aspects of the rules and some others, the CFTC. And so, there is a sense that there is this movement in the topic. But, I would say that for us, absolutely these things are great, if and when they happen. They are not embedded in any of our plans. If and when they occur, they\u2019d be a tailwind to our plans. And as you know, we take a broad and holistic approach to all of these things, not only by training our people but by building all of these regulatory processes into the way we do business. So for instance being able to do these simulations of our balance sheet and income statement and cash flows several months, 18 months into the future is an important part of how we make decisions and not really seeing it is something that we break out, specifically as a cost and as a cost that would be reduced but certainly I\u2019m happy to say that our focus as just did beyond the implementing of the regulations, which is something we will always do as they arise to growth. Mike Mayo : Well, as a follow-up on expenses, $3 billion or $5 billion growth initiatives, what are the upfront expenses, were there any in the third quarter and do you expect any special charges or how much the ramp-up? Marty Chavez : So, on the $5 billion of revenue opportunities, we describe for you the blended marginal margin of those opportunities. And there is a bit of a drag upfront, really relating to hiring to people. So, as we mentioned in September, our lateral hires are year-to-date up \u2013 they doubled from the same period last year and we broke out the kinds of professionals we\u2019re hiring. And you see that coverage and distribution is the major focus of that. As we progress on the initiatives, perhaps there will be some modest upward pressure on the comp ratio but we wouldn\u2019t see that being material in the context of the firm. And we also don\u2019t see any significant charges for this growth. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Could we talk about a couple of things? One is Marcus, I know in the deck last September, you indicated that you\u2019re looking to drive that to $12 billion footings over the next couple of years. Could you just give us a little bit more color on the average kind of person that you\u2019re looking for, and what kind of yields you\u2019re expecting and how you think through the impact of a recession on that business? Marty Chavez : So, on Marcus, we recently passed $1.7 billion in originations, and we\u2019re on track to reach $2 billion, 10 weeks now, by the end of this year. Our focus is absolutely on prime borrowers. The FICO score realized is definitely above 700. These are small ticket items. And as we\u2019ve said and this continues to be the case, this is organically growing business, we\u2019re doing it slowly and deliberately. I\u2019ll note that while we have and have had for a long time strong risk analytics, particularly credit risk analytics underlying the business, we\u2019re not leading with underwriting in this business; we\u2019re leading with a better product and service and digital experience for consumers, and that remains the focus. I would also add on the realized losses, they have been less than what was put into the plan. And we are well aware, as all of us are of where we are in the credit cycle. Even though Marcus is a new business for us, the people who are building and leading that business for us are industry veterans and consumer finance, and we\u2019re plugging them in with our long track record of being thoughtful, prudent risk managers for both Marcus and credit risk. And we\u2019ve also supplemented our teams with people who have consumer finance experience across the board from branding and marketing to the 360 degree customer view and of course to all of the control function. And we\u2019re extending the risk culture we\u2019ve always had into this business where we worry about everything and plan for all of the contingencies and don\u2019t take it for granted, and especially remind ourselves every day we\u2019re not leading with underwriting, we\u2019re leading with a better product. Betsy Graseck : That\u2019ll make sense, that will be helpful if you had a little more detail on that. I know that -- I think you\u2019re planning on giving a little more detail around the granularity of the FICO mix and yields and loss content like we get another card portfolio. So, I will appreciate that when it comes. Just a second question I had was on the dividend. I know you gave the buyback of $8.7 billion for the full year. Are you going to let us know what the dividend outlook is here. Marty Chavez : Yes, Betsy, I\u2019m happy to mention that as well. So, the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our plan had in the capital plan the option to raise the dividend by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of next year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I was hoping if you could maybe unpack a bit the $5 billion of incremental equity tied to your growth targets. I know, we\u2019ve got -- I think you laid out $28 billion of loan balances. But, I am guessing there is probably some balance sheet consumption on your trading initiatives too. So, could you maybe just give us an idea about that attribution? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, on the initiatives, we did highlight for you our $5 billion of required equity. I am happy to walk you through it. And again, as with all aspects of what we set out for you and for the market, it\u2019s really -- it bottoms up looking at the activities where the businesses, where these activities are going to occur. So, roughly $2 billion of the $5 billion annual opportunity in three years is related to lending. And most of that balance sheet is in our Marcus, our institutional lending and private wealth management and GS Select businesses, and that totals $28 billion of balance sheet. And to get to the equity, we looked at the businesses that these activities are embedded in and we projected the RWA density out from those businesses. So, it was just that, and bottoms up again. On the FICC part of the activity, which is a $100 million of the annual opportunities that we identified and that we are pursuing, that one I would see in a bit of a different perspective; FICC capital is dynamic. We see actually considerable scope for the velocity of our FICC portfolio to increase. And so, it\u2019s really portfolio-driven and dynamic, and don\u2019t see considerable or specific equity component attributable to that. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for that. And then, following up on Mike\u2019s question about MiFID and your response there, I appreciate all of that. It seems as though if we look through your disclosure about the lateral hires that you\u2019ve made recently, both EMEA and FICC sales functions tend to feature prominently in some of those lateral hires. Do you all think that the -- does that have to do with positioning yourself in front of MiFID, do you feel as though that FICC sales effort will become more important and therefore you are trying to invest in bulk up there? Can you just -- or am I jumping on the wrong conclusion from that chart? If you could just help understand that that would be great. Thanks Marty. Marty Chavez : I wouldn\u2019t see the hires which we\u2019ve been talking about and which as you noted are weighted towards sales distribution. I wouldn\u2019t see them so much as MiFID-related. I am sure that\u2019s in there; of course it\u2019s in there but it\u2019s not the driver. Really there, it\u2019s the coverage gaps that we\u2019ve been talking about. And we saw the opportunity and noted our ability to bring in the talent. So, of the hires, of the offers we\u2019ve been making, the acceptance rate\u2019s over 80%. And we\u2019ve looked and we\u2019ve talked about this in September in some detail, specifically in FICC, looking at all of the clients and noting the ones for whom they say we are a top 3 FICC provider and the ratio of the clients where were a top 3 FICC provider is in the neighborhood of the 30% for banks and asset managers and insurance companies, and this is considerably higher for some other segments. And so just closing those gaps is something that of course requires all the resources of the firm. But it\u2019s a people business and so especially the people, and so that\u2019s the main driver of the hiring. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : So, just -- not to harp, but I wanted to stand a little bit on Betsy\u2019s question about expected loss through the cycle because one of the push backs that I had when I spoken to investors about your growth opportunities is that the implied margins on the loan asset balances don\u2019t seem to many people like they really incorporate sort of full through the cycle loss potential. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that, maybe look at Marcus and maybe one or two of the other lending categories and talk about what your loan loss expectations look like? Marty Chavez : Yes. So, on loan loss expectations, again on -- I\u2019ll start with the Marcus example, its prime borrowers and that\u2019s an important part of the strategy. And there, again, we imply our analytics. The Marcus business is a new one for us, loan level analytics are the old ones for us, particularly as they relate to securitizations of various kinds. And so we have that prudent and comprehensive approach to risk management and prudent reserving. So, the ALLL against that portfolio or something to get a careful scrutiny and attention from all of us and that will continue and that\u2019s part of our process. And I also shared with you the realized losses are less than what we expected in our plan and that\u2019s so far and that\u2019s where we are in our business growth in our cycle. Let\u2019s go to a different example, which is on our PWM business. These are high net worth individuals and it\u2019s very different business. They are the highest quality borrowers and they are also -- the loans are significantly over-collateralized. Guy Moszkowski : Fair enough, okay. And maybe just changing the subject and maybe I\u2019ll pursue some of these questions on credit with you offline. But on FICC, you noted that commodities were still sort of bottom decile. I guess that means in terms of your historical quarter revenue experience with commodities, but it sounded like it was better linked quarter. I was just hoping that you could give us a little bit of color, on the one hand what got better but on the other hand, why you still believe that you\u2019re doing sort of bottom decile quarters here. Marty Chavez : So, to start with, that\u2019s one part of your question. So for commodities business, even though it was an improvement from the second quarter, which I\u2019ll remember, was our worst commodities quarter in our history as a public company of 73 quarters. Now it\u2019s 74 quarters as a public company, as I mentioned, the third quarter commodity performance was bottom decile of those 74 quarters. And it\u2019s on track to have the worst full year performance since the IPO. I would like to step back for just a minute and just quickly go through the sequential drivers, the year-on-year drivers but like to give you the nine-month on nine-month view, a bigger time period as well, because there\u2019s some informational content in that view that you don\u2019t get if you\u2019re just looking at -- if you\u2019re just comparing quarters. And so, sequentially, yes, our FICC business improved and that\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s good to see. But, it is by no means aspirational. We know we can do better and we know we need to do better. So, it is an improvement. In the sequential comparison in FICC ICS, it\u2019s really rates that drove the majority of that improvement. I\u2019ll get to the other driver in a second. But it\u2019s really the rates business. And there, particularly, in the latter part of the third quarter, there was better U.S. economic data, there were central bank actions, volumes increased, rates broke out of the 10-month trading range, curve flattened, lots of things happened. And so, rates is really the main driver. And the other driver is that the challenges and the inventory challenges we\u2019ve described in commodities, and by the way, this is challenged on all fronts, not just inventory, but the inventory challenges were a little better in the third quarter than in the second quarter. And there\u2019s also a connection to our bar number which declined a bit, $4 million sequentially and the drivers in the bar number going down were all continuing to decline across products but also reduced commodity positions. So, that\u2019s the sequential story. The year-on-year story, as you know, four out the five FICC businesses were lower; mortgages was the only business that was up. And the year-on-year story is really two main factors, lower client activity across the FICC businesses, particularly in the macro businesses and then the inventory challenges in commodities. But, as I said at the outset, I think if we step back and look at the first nine months of this year in FICC and compare it to the first nine months of last year, you see something different that you couldn\u2019t otherwise piece together, which is, if you look at the delta in FICC, half of that decline -- and so it\u2019s 23% decline, nine months on nine months, half of it is attributable to commodities inventory; and of that amount, half of that occurred in the second quarter. And so, I think that just gives you the whole picture. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And since I was the guy who gave you such a hard time about the buyback disclosure last quarter, I should certainly thank you for doing it now. Marty Chavez : We were listening, Guy. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe if you could just talk about your deposit gathering efforts, how that\u2019s progressing so far? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, deposit gathering is an important part of our financing strategy. It\u2019s continuing to diversify our sources of funding. Our Treasurer, Robin Vince gave quite allusive discussion of this in our Fixed Income Investor Call. We\u2019re happy to say more about it. In the deposit gathering, note that of course as you know, we acquired an online savings account platform that had previously been a part of GE, and we\u2019re gratified to see the growth in those deposits on really essentially no marketing of it. And so, in those deposits, even though there have been Fed reserve raising fund rates over the last several months, the experience in the online savings account has been that the rates gone from 105 basis points to very recently 130, which is near the top end. And so that tells you something, it\u2019s an attracting funding source for us relative to the wholesale market. It also tells you something about realized beta that we\u2019ve experienced so far. Jim Mitchell : But then, what were the flows like in the quarter? Marty Chavez : I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics on the flows. But I think, Heather, that\u2019s a good one to get back on. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And maybe just one question on regulatory change. SLR, I think would be a big positive for you in terms of the leverage constraint but I think there\u2019s been some uncertainty about how or if the tier 1 leverage continues or not. How do you -- how do we kind of I guess try to arms around, do you have a thought on if the SLRs changed, would the tier 1 leverage also change, therefore freeing up some capital or balance sheet, or do you think that remains? Marty Chavez : So, I will get to that but actually I\u2019ve pulled out the growth in total deposit, this is not just the online savings account; it\u2019s about $7 billion quarter on a quarter. But to get back to your question on SLR, so certainly, there has been a lot of discussion about how the SLR ratio might change. And as we said in the second quarter, if the various treasury recommendations on treatment of central bank cash, treasuries, initial margin at CCPs, if those all come into force, and we don\u2019t have the details, but that\u2019s a roughly 70 basis-point improvement on our SLR of the second quarter; I wouldn\u2019t expect it would be much different from the third quarter. And so, to the extent those changes happen, it would very likely have a thinking differently more expansively about our prime brokerage and matchbook businesses. And then, I think this has been well-highlighted across the industry, if those changes were to come into effect, it would be equivalent of creating another SIFI in terms of SLR capacity for the various businesses that our SLR intensive. So, these are all potentially tailwinds. And as you know, we and many others welcome the initiatives and the detail of the first and second treasury reports that there -- the potential tailwinds, they are not baked into our $5 billion annual revenue plan. Jim Mitchell : I appreciate that I was just thinking about the constraint in the CCAR from Tier 1 leverage, which would limit any benefits from the SLR. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of do you think that would also change to help free up that capacity or not? Marty Chavez : I would love to know the answer to that question. CCAR is as you know continuously evolving process. I suppose one way of looking at it would be -- the perfect result would for all of the constraints in CCAR, Tier 1, SLR on and on, all of them to be exactly binding by exactly the same amount; that would be a perfect optimization. But of course, it\u2019s evolving and we don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s going to play out. As you know, there was a white paper and governor to rule out just before its departure outlined a variety of proposals and we\u2019ve read them closely, I\u2019m sure you have as well. And we considered the proposal to be thoughtful but many of the important things still remain to be seen and they would have to be in an upcoming notice of proposed rule-making, and that\u2019s when we will get the insight on your question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with two-parter on investment management. So, first just on the quarterly trends. I was hoping you can just shed some light on what drove the decline in management fees linked quarter, just given the strong equity markets that we saw and the pretty health -- continued healthy increasing AUM. And then, just thinking longer term in relation to the $1 billion revenue target to business investment management where we\u2019ve seen pretty substantial secular headwinds and fee pressures, and I\u2019ve got a lot of questions from clients as to what\u2019s giving you guys the confidence that you can hit that $1 billion incremental revenue target. And I was hoping you can shed some additional light on those opportunities. Marty Chavez : Sure. So, let me start with the first part of your question. Yes, as you noted, we have grown assets under supervision by $50 billion. About half of that was market appreciation. And then looking into the other half; that was again almost evenly split between gathering long-term assets, mostly fixed income and then, also an increase in assets in our liquidity products. And so, on the effective fee, the effective fee actually has been stable sequentially. And so, really the answer to your question is, it\u2019s in the other part of management and other fees; there\u2019s some puts and takes that were slight offsets when you do the quarter on quarter comparison. Going to the second part of your question on the investment management opportunities that we outlined, which was as we said a $1 billion annual revenue opportunity. Look at that in three parts and the three parts are roughly balanced. But the key to all three parts is what has been the key to that business and the successful asset gathering over the long haul that you\u2019ve seen, which is that it\u2019s broad and it\u2019s deep across asset classes as well as different products and distribution channels, retail and institutional. And so, to go back to the breakout of the $1 billion in annual revenue growth, splitting it into the three parts, I\u2019ll start with GSAM. So, there, it\u2019s growing our alternatives platform, advisory and insurance, EPS and liquidity products. On PWM we\u2019re hiring advisors, investing in the platform including digital experiences, adding products and services there. And the third part is Ayco, it\u2019s our corporate executives counseling business. And there, we absolutely see opportunities in incoming from our clients on expanding those financial planning services, in two ways. First to more of the people inside the companies that we\u2019re already working with; and then in addition to more companies. So really stepping back, it\u2019s the franchise which is unique in the case of investment management. It\u2019s broad product portfolios, there\u2019s room to grow across the board, and it\u2019s diversified and hence the opportunity set. Steven Chubak : Thanks Marty, that was really helpful color. And then, just switching over to just one question on the capital discussion, I think as relates to Jim\u2019s earlier question on thinking about various binding constraints, just given your historically strong discipline on managing to what\u2019s your most binding capital ratio, I was a little bit surprised to see the deterioration in the SLR linked quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, if you can give us some insight in how you\u2019re thinking about the need to focus more on some of the growth opportunities which maybe you had, not emphasized as much given your continued strong capital discipline. And separately, we did see your GSIB surcharge also increase last quarter, or your systemic risk score, and I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about managing to that as well. Marty Chavez : Sure. So, I\u2019ll start with the SLR, fully-phased. So, as you know, it declined by 20 basis points sequentially, and that is growth in the balance sheet. And you also saw that in the increase in the balance sheet from 907 at the end of the second quarter to 930. And there, it\u2019s supporting our clients in deploying the balance sheet when we see the opportunities to do so. It was, as you know, in CCAR 2017, the binding constraints, and that\u2019s something that we are deeply aware of. But as we know, much depends on the next evolution of CCAR. And also potentially on recalibration of SLR, there\u2019s been different views from different regulators on recalibrating SLR or not recalibrating SLR, we don\u2019t know exactly how all of that\u2019s going to evolve. Now, can you remind me of the second part of your question? Steven Chubak : Just around the GSIB score, I think in the past you\u2019d been at 2.5% and it increased to 3% last quarter and how you are thinking about managing that score as you think about some of the growth initiatives? Marty Chavez : Sure, right. So, also in the third quarter, as the GSIB buffer, we\u2019re again in that 3% range and it\u2019s something that we look at every day and work with divisional leaders as we see opportunities to have a strong balance sheet and capital and deploy it and invest in our business and long-term growth. We can do both. We can both grow the business and return capital. But at the margins, I would say growth is more valuable. And as for where as you know, the GSIB print at the end of this quarter is an important one, and I can\u2019t predict where it\u2019s going to end up in this quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : So, maybe first one here, the securities basis loan arrangement with Fidelity that was announced last quarter was pretty interesting. And I am curious, is that starting to ramp? And it also sounded like there could be more arrangements in the future with additional wealth management firms that don\u2019t have those capabilities. So, really just trying to get sense of the broader securities-based loan strategy, the firm with outside firms and then how big that is within kind of the private wealth piece of the balance sheet opportunity? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, we highlighted for you in the growth initiatives on annual revenue opportunity of $500 million related to PWM and GS Select together. On GS Select, this is something that we\u2019re all excited about and focused on, which is to again, and you\u2019ll detect this theme in other places, lead with an all digital straight thorough offering. It is extremely early days in that business, and we\u2019re very pleased with the Fidelity announcement that you noted. They saw the innovation in the platform and the opportunities just have a great service. As you know its loans of upto $25 million and is significantly over collateralized, and it\u2019s interesting opportunity. It\u2019s too early to give you progress but it is a part of the initiatives that we outlined, which right now we are aggregating under PWM -- PWM and GS Select together, $500 million revenue opportunity, $11 billion of balance sheet over three years and the implied the yield is evident from that. Devin Ryan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just follow-up here. It sounded like some of the hiring that firm is doing ahead of revenue, could influence the comp ratio a bit but it is sounded like that\u2019s going to be modest. Can you maybe just more broadly speak to what you are seeing in the competitive environment in comp dynamics right now? It seems like there are some of the European firms are more aggressively recruiting again in some of the areas that Goldman is also looking to expand. So, maybe that\u2019s temporary but I\u2019m just curious kind of how that feeds through as you think about kind of the outlook for the comp ratio? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, I would say that the most important thing to think about for us and we believe for our shareholders is the operating leverage and comp ratio obviously a part of that. You will notice the first half 2 :1 ratio between the revenue growth and the expense growth and you\u2019ll also see that ratio in our nine-month results versus nine months of the last year. As revenues grow, I would not expect that ratio to be linear, and we would see even more operating leverage. In the competitive dynamics, as we mentioned and this is continuing, lateral hiring is up significantly, it\u2019s doubled from last year. And we are continuously happy to see, but no way take it for granted that we are very successful and attracting the talent. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Question, lot has been talked about amongst you folks as well as your peers about the lack of volatility in the marketplace, particularly in FICC. With the federal reserve moving into a full unwind next year, have you guys mapped out what the volatility could do because of this changing position by the federal reserve and what it might do for the revenues for your FICC business? Marty Chavez : Sure. So, we think about volatility a lot and we think at least as much, maybe more about the level of client activity, which is very important for us. And so, looking at the Fed\u2019s announcement, so that has been extremely thoughtful and transparent in its communication, and we would expect that to continue. It\u2019s just part of how the fed operates. We don\u2019t of course know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, and we don\u2019t make predictions. So, we do create lot\u2019s and lot\u2019s of contingency plans and so looking at what the Fed has said, as you know they\u2019ve been very specific, they\u2019ve given us $10 billion a month and then that\u2019s going to increase every three months by $10 billion, and so it gets to $50 billion and letting assets roll off that redemption from their balance sheet and they\u2019ve given us the mix between treasuries and agencies. They said it\u2019s going to -- they expect that mix to be stable with some variations, just depending on the maturities and their balance sheet. So really, you can\u2019t get much more specific and communicative than that. And also just note that there\u2019s a positive backdrop, so the U.S. economy is performing, there\u2019s improving GDP growth depending on who you talk to, the U.S. is at or perhaps even beyond full employment. And at the same time, all of this unwinding quantitative easing is unprecedented territory, never happened before. So, you could see volatility and spikes showing up in this process, simply because it\u2019s never happened before. We don\u2019t see duly unwind risk priced into the markets. You could imagine of all spikes that that client confidence make market making difficult, you could also imagine a positive scenario with modest fall, more conviction, more activity, all of these things could be catalysts for the FICC business, rising inflation, any changes in central bank policies against the expected trajectory, clarity on U.S. policies of all kinds, tax, obviously regulation, also infrastructure, all of these things you could see as better catalysts. The important thing to note and pause on is that the Fed has been clear that the economic backdrop is good and that\u2019s generally good for business. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then, second question, can you give us some color on -- you talked about the total dollar amount of the capital return on the call today. The dividend payout ratio, is there any guidance where you think that may eventually end up in a more normalized adversary of the next 12 to 24 months where you guys are comfortable to have a dividend payout ratio. Marty Chavez : So, all we know for now is that a $0.05 increase -- the option to increase by $0.05 is embedded in our capital plan, which is what the Fed has approved. And as for the dividend payout ratio, it\u2019s been around 15% for a while, and I\u2019m not going to predict what it will be in the future. Just that $0.05 is all we know for now, we continue to emphasize buyback, as you know, but really as we said, a month ago and so important for us, we would always prefer to execute on these 30% plus marginal ROE opportunities compared to buying back our shares. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : I\u2019m going ask two questions. One was, when you think of the investing and lending especially on the equity side where you said you all given the market conditions or you said kind of harvesting aggressively. Is part of that related too, because if you look at the increase, there\u2019re about $1.8 billion increase in what you had in the equity security gains. There\u2019s about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income so you kind of have offsetting effect with those two things, which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year. So, just to know if you all were doing that just because of market conditions, are you trying to balance the mix and so should we expect this when we have some volatility in other sides of the business? Marty Chavez : Well, you definitely noticed those offsetting effects and we did too obviously. I would say in that area of our business, we\u2019re fiduciaries. And so, we see it as in the interest of our clients to harvest these investments and the asset price levels in the market are supportive. So, it\u2019s a good time. That portfolio as you know while we report on the results quarterly, we think of it over much, much longer time horizon than quarterly. Marty Mosby : Then my second question is, if you look at the seasonal progression of that comp ratio, given that you do have this investment lending gains your revenues are still kind of at the same level you had last year. So, should we still see the drop off in comp ratio kind of at the end of the year as you true up your bonuses and get all that squared away? Marty Chavez : So, yes, revenues sequentially are up, year-on-year are up and year-to-date importantly are up 8%, which is significant. As for the comp ratio, of course we -- it\u2019s an important part of our business and we put a lot of time and energy into considering it and setting it appropriately. And the 40% that we took it to, so 40% for the nine months, year-to-date is as we mentioned the 100 basis points lower than last year and at this point it\u2019s the best estimate we have. Marty Mosby : Yes, usually seasonally we drop down around 30% in the fourth quarter, so just to know if that was still reasonable assumption or is there anything different about this year that would cause that to vary from several prior years where we\u2019ve seen that trend? Marty Chavez : Of course that trend is there, I would just say go back to the commitment to operating leverage, something we think about everyday of the many things we think about every day. But really, I can\u2019t say more about where we are going to end up this year other than it\u2019s the best estimate, taking in all the information that we have right now. Marty Mosby : Perfect. So, year-over-year, operating leverage would be something to make sure we kind of still assume, so that would make sense. Thanks, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, Marty. Yes, a question on capital return with that disclosure that you gave. So, I mean, the share repurchase authorization is up 30% year-on-year. When we look at kind of your DFAST CCAR results, I mean your capital level was up a little bit -- at the starting point was up a little bit year-on-year, the losses that you saw within DFAST were up modestly as well. So, what allowed you, I guess within this year\u2019s CCAR to kind of return more capital? Was there some kind of change in how the Fed looked at RWA inflation or something else? I mean, because I think historically you said -- previous CFO had said that there was kind of check mark to your minimum ratio, is that still the case? Marty Chavez : Yes. So, the main difference is just the different starting points in the capital ratios. Brian Kleinhanzl : And there was no other real changes from the Fed side and\u2026 Marty Chavez : Not -- nothing too surprising, right? There were some things that the Fed said they would over a two-year period, and that\u2019s what happened. There really wasn\u2019t any big -- any surprises of note, it\u2019s just the different starting points. Brian Kleinhanzl : Do you know the capital dollar amounts were only up less than $2 billion year-on-year starting points or really increased by more than that, is it just the ratios are higher simply? Marty Chavez : Yes, it\u2019s just the ratios are higher. That\u2019s right. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Marty Chavez : Thank you for calling in, and look forward to meeting with many of you over the balance of the quarter. If you have any additional questions, please contact Heather, and for those of you who were not able connect with, enjoy the upcoming holiday season, and thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today January 17, 2018. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial conditions may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2016. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I\u2019ll now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez. Marty? Marty Chavez : Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for dialing in this morning. Before diving into our results, let\u2019s first discuss the effect of U.S. tax reform and the potential future implications. We can then walk through our fourth quarter and 2017 performance. And finally, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions. When you take a step back and think of the implications related to the new tax law, you can categorize them in two main buckets, direct and indirect. Let\u2019s discuss the direct impacts first. We took a $4.4 billion onetime charge in the fourth quarter. This includes approximately $3.3 billion associated with the onetime deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and approximately $1.1 billion related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets. The current estimate of the DTA impact reflects further refinement of our numbers since our December announcement. Based on our current understanding of the rules, another direct consequence will be a reduction in our effective tax rate to approximately 24%. On the indirect side of the equation, there is clearly the potential for increased business activity. Potential benefits could take many forms including heightened M&A activity, increased financing volumes, or the most important indirect benefit to our business, economic growth. Despite the fourth quarter charge, the direct benefits from forward EPS and ROE accretion, coupled with the potential for several indirect tailwinds are material, long-term positive for shareholders. With that out of the way, let\u2019s review our results. Fourth quarter net revenues were $7.8 billion, net earnings including the one-time tax charge were a loss of $1.9 billion and EPS was a negative $5.51. Excluding the one-time tax charge, fourth quarter net earnings were $2.5 billion and EPS was $5.68. With respect to our 2017 full year reported results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $32.1 billion, up 5% versus 2016. Including the one-time tax charge, net earnings were $4.3 billion and EPS was $9.01. Excluding the charge, we had net earnings of $8.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year; earnings per share of $19.76, up 21%. Our return on average common equity was 10.8%, and we grew book value per share by 5% year-over-year. We were able to post these strong results despite the industry-wide headwinds, facing one of our businesses, FICC, and despite continued investments in future revenue opportunities that has not yet contributed meaningfully to earnings. Once again, solid performance against that backdrop. The environment in 2017 turned out to be mixed. Continued strength in global equity and credit markets coincided with lower levels of market volatility and client trading activity. And with these headwinds, we concentrated on serving our clients, rolling out our growth initiatives, and investing to drive our business forward. Three of our four business segments including Investment Banking, Investment Management, and Investing & Lending produced solid net revenue growth and led to an overall increase in the firm\u2019s revenues. Conversely, in Institutional Client Services and FICC in particular, revenues declined as the business continued to operate in a low volatility, low activity environment. Our solid overall performance in 2017 demonstrates the value of our diversified business model and the strength of our client franchise. And as I will talk about later, we are making significant engineering investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues, and transform the long-term earnings profile of the firm. With that as background, let\u2019s discuss the individual businesses in detail. In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2.1 billion, 19% higher than the third quarter, as a significant pickup in underwriting more than offset a decline in M&A. Advisory revenues were $772 million. The 15% decline relative to the third quarter reflects a decrease in the number of completed M&A transactions. Nonetheless, we advised on over 75 transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, representing approximately $120 billion of deal volume. We also participated in announced transactions totaling $450 billion, a pace that more than doubled third quarter volumes. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 55% sequentially as equity issuance improved and we participated in numerous large transactions around the world. Equity underwriting net revenues of $460 million more than doubled compared to the third quarter, driven by an increase in follow-on offerings including our role as sole arranger into Toshiba\u2019s \u00a5600 billion private placement. Debt underwriting net revenues increased 35% to $909 million and included significant contributions from leveraged finance activity. It\u2019s worth spending a moment on our debt underwriting franchise which we have built into a nearly $3 billion business. This is more than double our average revenue run rate from 2009 to 2011. This growth happened despite our smaller lending footprint because we identified it as a strategic priority where we saw an opportunity to grow share, invested continuously over a number of years and executed relentlessly for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.4 billion, up 18% from 2016 on increases in both financial advisory and underwriting. Results included a 40% increase in equity underwriting and record debt underwriting revenues which rose 20%. Our Investment Banking franchise remains very well-positioned and continues to grow. For the full year 2017, Investment Banking generated its second highest annual revenues since our IPO. This strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities. We ended 2017 ranked first in both global announced and completed M&A and held the number one position in global equity underwriting. Additionally, we have a leading position in leveraged finance where we have picked up market share over the last several years by successfully integrating our strategic advisory capabilities with our capital markets and market-making franchises. Looking forward, our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the third quarter, driven by announced M&A volumes. It was also higher compared to a relatively solid level at the end of 2016. The new tax legislation in the U.S. has brought significant clarity for corporations, and as a result, our level of dialogue with clients has increased across a range of strategic and financial issues. Turning to Institutional Client Services. Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, down 24% compared to the third quarter amid lower volumes in a variety of markets and continued low volatility. For the full year, ICS generated $11.9 billion of net revenues, down 18% compared to 2016, also driven by lower volatility in client activity and a particularly challenging backdrop for our commodities franchise. FICC client execution net revenues were $1 billion in the fourth quarter, down significantly versus the third quarter, reflecting a continued challenging operating environment. We saw lower sequential performance across four of our five fixed income businesses. Commodities improved versus the difficult third quarter, reflecting our risk mitigation efforts. Currencies and rates both declined amid a backdrop of volatility and currencies included a weaker emerging markets performance. Credit and mortgages also saw weaker results in this environment. For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $5.3 billion, translating into a 30% year-over-year decline. Most of our businesses were impacted by low volatility across global markets, which affected client activity. For example, during the year, we saw historically low volatility levels in U.S. and European interest rates, and volatility in G10 currencies hovered near post-crisis lows. We also saw tighter bid ask spreads across various products. Low levels of volatility also had a disproportionate effect on us given our active investor oriented client base. During the course of the year, we saw lower levels of derivative activity and fewer large transactions which historically have been areas of strength. Looking specifically at our FICC performance of the year. Commodities was the largest single driver of our year-over-year decline, representing more than one-third of the delta amid inventory challenges and muted client activity. Across the rest of our macro franchise, currencies and rates were also significantly lower compared to a year ago. A variety of factors including reduced volatility and lower client activity which particularly affected G10 currencies contributed to the decline. Credit also decreased significantly amid relatively low client activity and declines in our U.S. high yield and distressed businesses. Mortgages, although a smaller business, increased significantly versus last year, reflecting improved performance in commercial and residential mortgages. Needless to say, we are highly engaged in improving our performance in FICC through our strategic initiatives. We are broadening our client and product footprint, and deepening our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share with key client groups. Client feedback has been positive. And we believe as we continue to improve our connectivity with clients, we can drive meaningfully better performance going forward. In equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, down 18% sequentially. Relative to the third quarter, equities client execution net revenues were down significantly on lower results in both cash and derivatives. ECE performance was partially offset by higher commissions and fees and the slight increase in security services. As it relates to fourth quarter equities client execution results, clearly not a strong quarter. However, quarterly performance will fluctuate as this business requires capital commitment to support our client franchise. Over time, these activities have been a consistent contributor to our equities franchise, comprising 30% to 40% of total equities revenues over the past five years. For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $6.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Despite very favorable trends for equity prices during the year, U.S. cash volumes fell by double digits, while equity market volatility fell to new lows. For the year, equities client execution net revenues were $2 billion, down 7%, driven by lower derivatives performance. Roughly two thirds of the annual decline relates to our on-exchange, single stock options business in the U.S., which we exited in the fourth quarter. Commissions and fees were $2.9 billion for the year, down only 5%, which outperformed the decline in U.S. cash volumes. Lastly, securities services generated relatively stable net revenues of $1.6 billion as higher client balances were offset by a mix shift in short covering to more liquid securities. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the fourth quarter was $54 million, up from $47 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by increased exposures associated with our equities franchise. Moving on to our Investing & Lending segment. Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting corporate performance as well as sales and gains in public equity investments. Approximately two-thirds of our performance was from mark-to-market on public securities and events such as sales in our private portfolio. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $449 million, which was largely driven by net interest income of roughly $500 million. Results included an impairment of approximately $130 million on a secured loan related to Steinhoff. Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $120 billion, up 4% or $4 billion versus last quarter, driven by continued growth and real estate, private wealth and consumer loans. Life to date, as of year-end, we originated approximately $2.3 billion of Marcus unsecured consumer loans and grew our online deposits by over $5 billion last year. In the fourth quarter, we also consolidated our online lending and deposit platforms under the Marcus brand. Feedback on lending and deposit products has been positive as we have been able to deliver real value to customers by offering simple and transparent products with the great user experience. We plan to build on this momentum in 2018, while remaining disciplined in our underwriting standard, focused on lending to creditworthy customers. For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $6.6 billion, driven by $4.6 billion in gains from equity securities and $2 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans. Within equity securities, $3.8 billion was related to private investments and approximately $800 million was related to public investments. Our net interest income within debt securities was approximately $1.8 billion for the year. Let me take a moment on the long-term contribution of our I&L segment. Equity investing is a capability that uniquely positions us in financial services and differentiates the firm in the eyes of our clients. It also has significantly contributed to book value per share growth and return through the cycle. With respect to debt I&L, the recent expansion of our lending activities positions the firm with $2 billion of run rate net interest income as we start 2018. In addition to driving revenue growth, increased lending has not only deepened our relationships with existing clients, it has also enabled us to establish new ones. We are confident that these efforts will continue to drive the growth of our client franchise and earnings. In Investment Management, we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, our second best quarterly performance. This was up 9% from the third quarter, primarily on solid growth in management and other fees, which were record despite broader industry headwinds. For 2017, Investment Management net revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in management and other fees on higher assets. Assets under supervision finished the year at a record $1.5 trillion, up $115 billion versus year end 2016 driven by $42 billion of long-term net inflows driven by fixed income and alternative products, $13 billion of liquidity product outflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. During the fourth quarter, AUS increased $38 billion, primarily driven by $17 billion of net inflows into liquidity products and $22 billion of market appreciation. Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards and other items such benefits was up 2% for 2017, which was 300 basis points lower than the increase in net revenues. This translated into a compensation-to-net revenues ratio of 37%, down 110 basis points versus 2016. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.6 billion. The increase versus the third quarter was driven primarily by a $127 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor-advised charitable fund, higher expenses related to consolidated investments and higher consulting fees. For the full year, non-compensation expenses rose 5%, largely driven by our investments to fund growth, partly offset by lower litigation expense. There were three main drivers of the increase which were fairly balanced contributors. The first driver relates to our investment in Marcus; second, were expenses associated with investments that need to be consolidated in our balance sheet for accounting purposes; and third, were higher technology and consulting costs to support both regulatory implementation efforts and our ongoing focus on improving efficiency and scale throughout our businesses. Underpinning our growth initiatives, we continue to make significant investments in engineering, which are critical to driving the expansion of our franchise. The two goals of our engineering strategy are two, enhance the client experience and drive revenue opportunities; and improve operating efficiency and scale. On the client side, we are exploring and embracing innovative solutions to evolve and transform our business model using machine learning, data analytics, APIs, cloud services and open-source to deliver new services. These investments will allow us to leverage our intellectual capital in more impactful ways, to evolve and be a disruptor in new and existing markets and will affect all of our businesses. From an efficiency perspective, we are automating processes and analyzing workflows, particularly in our market-making businesses. There are significant opportunities to operate more efficiently across the firm. Moving on to taxes, our underlying tax rate for 2017 was 28.4% excluding the impact from tax legislation and employee equity compensation accounting. Our reported effective tax rate for the year was 61.5% including the $4.4 billion tax charge, which was partially offset by a $719 million benefit related to employee equity compensation. Our fourth quarter tax rate reflected $223 million of this benefit, primarily from the delivery of certain prior year equity awards in December. For the first quarter of 2018, assuming current stock price levels, we estimate the equity compensation related accounting benefit will be approximately $175 million. Turning to balance sheet, liquidity and capital. Our global core liquid assets averaged $221 billion during the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet was $917 billion, down slightly versus last quarter. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.9% using the standardized approach and 10.7% under the Basel III Advanced approach, down a 110 basis points and 100 basis points respectively versus the third quarter. Approximately 70 basis points of the decline was related to the onetime tax charge with the remainder of the change related primarily to continued growth in lending. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 5.8%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock for $1.6 billion. For the full year, we repurchased $6.7 billion at an average purchase price of roughly $232 per share. As a result, we reduced our basic share count by approximately 26 million shares for the year, reaching a new record low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned nearly $8 billion of capital to shareholders in 2017. As we look forward to 2018, given the positive backdrop for investing further in our franchise and the impact of tax legislation on our capital ratios, we do not expect to use all of our 2017 CCAR cycle authorization. Over the past three years, our share buybacks have been approximately $5 billion to $6 billion per annual CCAR cycle. We believe this is a fair expectation over the medium term subject to a variety of factors. However, given the capital impact from tax legislation, we do not expect to buyback at that pace in the first half of 2018. Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We enter 2018 well-positioned for growth. We are working intensely to achieve our $5 billion in strategic growth initiatives with an emphasis on growing earnings and returns. We remain committed to growing our global client franchise and have received positive feedback on our early progress. To do that, we continue to invest in our franchise, to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent and by our willingness to explore new disruptive opportunities. Finally, there are also a number of positive tailwinds that could drive greater client engagements and a more expansive opportunity set. We start 2018 with renewed optimism for accelerating growth in the U.S. and abroad. Higher interest rates and more active central banks often correlate with higher client activity. And as I mentioned previously, the recent change in U.S. tax law is driving increased client dialogue in investment banking and across the broader client franchise which could stimulate increased confidence and activity. With that, thanks again for dialing in and we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Good morning. So, in the past, better DCM revenues eventually led to better secondary revenue, and I heard all the comments on this really low vol in just about every asset class. But, I\u2019m curious if there is any component that it\u2019s a lot of leveraged finance or there is a lot of money going into bond funds just buying every new issue and putting it away. It feels like the whole dynamic has changed as we sit here and wait for vol to pick up. But it seems like revenues have fallen more than even the drop in vol. Marty Chavez : So, Glenn, are you asking more about our debt underwriting business or about our FICC client execution business? Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that, fair enough. It\u2019s a little bit of a combination of both. I am asking about the geography and the main contributor to the pick-up in DCM and why there is not a follow through in FICC as there was in the past? Marty Chavez : Well, clearly Glenn, we agree with you that better DCM revenues can result in better secondary revenues in FICC client execution over time. But to talk a bit more about our debt underwriting business, as we said, record in many ways, not only league tables, also revenues full year on the quarter. So there are many things going on in there. There is trends in rates, spreads and vol, those are all -- plus M&A of course, all driving demand for issuance. And as you know, overall financing costs, even with the rate increases are still low historically. Really, the key to our debt underwriting business over time and in this quarter has been the alignment with acquisition finance and our M&A franchise broadly including our relationship with financial sponsors. And that\u2019s really something, as I mentioned that we identified as a priority a few years ago as our core strength versus lending, which might have been part of the strategy for others. And so by aligning with the M&A franchise and focusing on it quarter-after-quarter, we got to this point. And that\u2019s really what differentiates our debt underwriting business compared to others. But to get back to the other part of your question, the pull through for trading requires a bunch of things, increased volatility, client activity, market events, central bank actions, all of those things could be drivers for greater activity in secondary. Glenn Schorr : Maybe just a one follow-up. In equity and I&L, I could be wrong. So, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But, I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve made lots of new investments for years on the equity side, but still seems like you have you own a ton of private equity. And in the world we live in, it seems like there has been lots of opportunity exit. Is this just the market going up or is there more of like annuity stream there? I like the $2 billion on the debt side that you told us about, but could you give a little more detail about the private side on the equity? Marty Chavez : Yes. Well, the equity I&L represents a diversified global portfolio. It\u2019s diversified across sectors and geographies; it\u2019s diversified across corporate, private equity and real estate. And we called out the driver which is gains in corporate performance and events. There is a public component of that portfolio, and we\u2019ll be saying more in the upcoming 10-K on the breakdown there. Really, I think it\u2019s important to observe that the 2017 revenues are driven by several hundred investments, not any one particular investment. And really what\u2019s distinctive about this franchise is that the sourcing capabilities are driven by a global network. And it\u2019s really that which creates a portfolio that has its own behavior and generally rising markets are helpful but it\u2019s not indexed in any way. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Maybe just first question. Historically, Goldman has been able to achieve a premium ROE versus peers. You guys always noted that in the past. That said, peer ROEs are set to rise on whether it\u2019s business mix, more exposure to rates and tax benefits. You guys had a $5 billion growth initiative. But other areas of the business like trading continue to see headwinds. And this year alone FICC raised about half of that $5 billion benefit. So, I guess, just how confident are you over a multiyear period? Are you going to sustain that premium and improving ROE? And if trading remains weak, do you need to do more strategically, whether it\u2019s on business mix or capital on cost allocation into the business? Marty Chavez : Well, first, of course, we have this track record of generating ROEs at or near the top of the peer group over the last several years. And the key there is not any one business; it\u2019s the diversity across our segment. And three of the four segments are up, as you know. And several of them had, really there is no other way to describe it other than the stellar performance. And so, we\u2019re always looking at our business mix; we\u2019re always looking at growth initiatives. We\u2019ve had them for years. For instance, debt underwriting is one that we identified, as I mentioned and we executed on. Really what\u2019s different in the growth initiatives that we shared with the market was we externalized that. So, that you will hold us accountable and we will hold ourselves accountable and it\u2019s galvanizing focus and attention over time. Now, when we look at FICC, we\u2019re always looking at optimizing every aspect of the business; capital allocation, expenses, the efficiency of the business. Generally, when we outline the growth initiatives, we said they do not depend on any change in the market environment. Where the market backdrop which as you know is challenging across the industry to deteriorate, of course, we would revisit all of those aspects of the business. Michael Carrier : Okay, it\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, you mentioned on the lower tax rate, potentially you see more activity. Just how are you guys thinking about your lower tax rate in terms of either reinvesting in the business, so basically like the expense outlook, as you look into 2018 or 2019 or how much will it drop to the bottom-line? And then, I guess, just from a competitive standpoint, do you expect a lot of the tax benefit to be passed on to clients just given competitive pressures? Marty Chavez : Well, so, I\u2019ll start by walking through our estimated, the go forward tax rate first off, which is a long-term effective tax rate 24%; that\u2019s just starting with the 21% new U.S. corporate tax rate, adding 2 points for state and local, adding 1 point for international impacts and all other effects [indiscernible] and so on. And we see in there, benefits, both ROE as well as EPS accretion in the high-single-digit percentage range. Now, as the next few years play forward, we don\u2019t know exactly how the competitive dynamics are going to evolve. But of course, we\u2019re looking to share those benefits across our shareholders, our clients and our people. And it\u2019s going to dependent, it\u2019s going to vary by business, but especially on competitive dynamics. But again, for us, I\u2019ll just say, the main effect that we see that the direct effect is driving earnings growth and ROE over time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I want to follow up on the buyback comment. So, I guess first, do you care to kind of better box or more tightly box the buyback expectations for the first half of the year versus just less than the 5 billion to 6 billion annual medium-term target? Marty Chavez : I am sorry, Matt. I couldn\u2019t hear the middle part of your question. Could you repeat that please? Matt O\u2019Connor: Sorry. Just on the share buybacks, I think you have said the medium-term outlook is for 5 billion to 6 billion annually, but as the pace in the first half would be less than that. And I was just wonder, if you want to give any more clarity on the amount that you\u2019re looking for on buybacks for the first half of this year and do you want to tighten up that range? Marty Chavez : So, as you know, Matt, there are so many factors that drive the buyback. There is our earnings profile and then of course over time there is the next CCAR cycle and the evolution of the test, which has many puts and takes in it, but especially depending on severity of the macro shock. And so, given all of that, we\u2019re not going to further break out the term structure of the buybacks, other than to say that $5 billion to $6 billion is the range over the medium term, which is very similar to our buyback in the past few years. There was 4.2 billion and 6 billion and 6.7 billion last year. So, 5 billion to 6 billion is the expectation. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, just in terms of committing more capital to growing the business, when you outlined the 5 billion initiatives back in September, I think you talked about some additional capital being committed to that. Is there any acceleration in that process? I did notice that the loan limits on Marcus I think were meaningfully increased, if I read correctly, the 40,000. Is there any kind of acceleration or front-ending of some of that capital commitment, as you think about growing out the -- those 5 billion of revenue initiatives? Marty Chavez : So, the capital that we underlined in the growth plan remains part of our long-term plan. And as for acceleration, no, we\u2019re operating according to the plan and it\u2019s evolving, though of course we\u2019re in the early stages. I would just say as it relates all of those growth initiatives, we\u2019ve got extensive dashboards. I love dashboards and those are going be metrics of all kinds, including the capital because of course we\u2019re changing from a -- where we\u2019ve been in the past few years. Now, we see these opportunities for growth, high marginal ROEs and of course we prefer all day to invest in these opportunities that are in our business compared to buying back our stock above book value. But, no particular acceleration in the capital plan but it\u2019s all baked into the plan. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Jeff Harte : Good morning, Marty. A couple for me. One, it\u2019s not hard to envision a more favorable operating environment in 2018 versus 2017. Can you give us any kind of updates on how quarter-to-date trends are progressing? I know, it\u2019s kind of early but I mean do you get the feeling seasonality is showing up? Marty Chavez : Well, Jeff, it is most definitely very early and 10 days into the quarter. And so, I would not extrapolate anything. But, I would say, market conditions can change and turn rapidly, and they have. And it\u2019s been a strong start to the year. Definitely, if you ask me this time last year, this time this year, I take this time this year all day. But again, no one, not you, not us especially would extrapolate anything from what we\u2019ve seen in just 10 days. Jeff Harte : Okay. And secondly, on the commodities business, can you give us a little historical perspective, I suppose on Goldman\u2019s commodities business? I mean, it\u2019s been a tough year. But, I guess, I am trying to get a feel for kind of the frequency of tough years historically versus other FICC businesses. And also, what we should be watching from the outside to maybe get indication things are getting better? It doesn\u2019t necessarily seem like exchange volumes and oil volatility are as useful as it used be. Marty Chavez : Well, Jeff, on historical perspective, I am definitely feeling my age since I grew up in that business. So, I could go on at too greater length on the historical perspective in the business. But, what I will say about it is some things are exactly the same, many things in the commodity business as they were when I was growing up in the early 90s, which is exchange volumes are an important part of the business, they are not all of the business. Some have said erroneously in our view in the past that there was an opposition between over the counter and exchange. Actually, we\u2019ve always seen exchange volumes and liquidity on exchange as potentiating the ability to provide liquidity and hedging solutions to clients over the counter. And so, those two businesses can be in a virtuous cycle and often are. The other thing about the commodity business that being in it teaches you is that maybe some other businesses will have very long term trends including trends that continue for decades, and that is rarely the case in the commodities business. I remember when I was in that business and people would ask me, well, you are the quant in the business, and so, what do you think about the outlook for oil prices. I would say accurately but perhaps not all that helpfully, 50% chance they go up and 50% chance they would go down. And so, the business is not predicated on any -- on directions and the view, it\u2019s really -- it begins and ends with the clients. The clients want to buy, we sell; they want to sell, we buy. It\u2019s intermediating all along the value chain from producers to refiners to consumers in all kinds of different product formats, which could be physical, futures, systematic trading strategies, derivatives. And so, what I will say, just to end is that the commodities environment was tough across the board. And for us, as you know, we have a bigger footprint in our commodities business as a part of our FICC franchise compared to others. And then, we\u2019ll also note as I mentioned last quarter to you, we made significant progress in reducing risk in the business, risk that we acquired on the back of facilitating what the clients wanted to do. And those inventory headwinds which were a challenge throughout the year for second and third quarter, subsided meaningfully in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, I\u2019m torn between the Investment Banking results versus the trading results. And I think I\u2019ve heard you say that you\u2019d like to do more trading with corporate clients where you\u2019re -- it\u2019s kind of a mix issue when it comes to the trading results, Goldman versus peers. So, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is if you\u2019re so strong in investment banking and advisory in particular that implies that Goldman has some of the best relationships with corporate CEOs on the planet. In other words you have great relationship with the CEOs, the boards of directors, the people on top of the house. So, why can\u2019t you do more business trading with those, so much further down from the top of the house? Marty Chavez : Well, it is the key question. And as you know, in our growth plans that we\u2019ve been talking about, there is a component of the $5 billion annual revenue opportunity developing over the next three years, a $250 million component, which is expanding our corporate franchise in both foreign exchange and commodities. This is something that actually isn\u2019t brand new for us; it\u2019s something that growing up in the business, I was at the intersection of those two businesses and worked in both, at various points in my career with the firm. And what you will notice and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, is that the different parts of our corporate clients are accountable for different parts of the business. And so, depending on the client, this actually changes greatly depending on the kind of corporate client. Just speaking about the commodity sector, it depends a lot whether you\u2019re talking with exploration and production, companies or diversified companies, or mid-stream; who is owning the hedging strategy for the company can vary greatly and it can go all the way from CFO to treasurer to assistant treasurer or sometimes it\u2019s on the procurement side. And so, translating these top-flight relationships that we have with CEOs across the -- deep inside the corporations to all the parts of them that are executing various kinds of business, not just the capital markets products and the M&A product but all of the products of the firm is work and effort and we see it as a huge opportunity to leverage our banking franchise to drive this kind of corporate business. And having embedded the market-making talent in the banking business more deeply than we ever have in the past, we\u2019re already seeing the benefits; we\u2019re already seeing mandates start to arise from that deeper integration. But still and all, having seen all of these significant declines in FICC, we still -- because of diversification, because of for instance our M&A franchise, we still have one of the highest ROEs in the industry. Mike Mayo : Right, but specifically on trading, it just seems like progress would have been a lot faster than it\u2019s been. In other words, it\u2019s not new news that you\u2019re underpenetrated to the corporate. What are you guys saying to employees internally, what are you saying in terms of intensity? Do you think you succeeded? Would you say so far your score card -- and I know it\u2019s only September since you came out with strategic growth initiatives but this isn\u2019t really new news; it predates the September presentation. How do you think you\u2019re doing in terms of penetrating deeper within your corporate clients, through the CFO, treasurer, procurement and the other people you mentioned? Marty Chavez : Well, to step back, we\u2019re making progress on all of the growth initiatives that we outlined, deploying balance sheet, growing deposits, AUS, hiring employees into FICC, improving market share in FICC and equities, and specifically increasing the mandates from this joint venture between investment banking and trading. And we are seeing according to all these metrics that we\u2019re making progress on the initiatives on all of the initiatives. Now, it\u2019s early days and of course, we\u2019ll be having many conversations with you and everyone in the market and certainly internally. We just came out with some internal discussions with our global managing directors where everybody knows that we\u2019re holding them accountable and you all are holding us accountable, and that breaks down a lot of detail, accountability matrices everywhere. And also, one thing that we know from having seen the cycles many times is that when we start making this progress in market share, it actually needs a better activity environment for the penetration to flow through to revenues. Mike Mayo : And then, last follow-up. What\u2019s the time from getting additional mandates to actually seeing the improvement in the trading? Marty Chavez : Well, the mandate timeframe is -- its order of months, quarters, it depends on deal flow, and all kinds of drivers. Again, activity which -- activity is the main one. Client activity is the main predictor of our results. And we\u2019re not just given a particular client mix or business footprint, we absolutely acknowledge that the business footprint and mix we have is consequence of choices that we made over time. And we know that we need to do better. But again, for all this to flow through to revenues and for those mandates to turn into printed revenues, we need activity. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I have just a slightly different way of asking that question, but on your outlook where you gave your three-year forward revenue potential growth initiatives. I know that part of that came with allocating more headcount to various groups, more headcount to FICC and more headcount to banking. Could you just give us a sense of how much that resource allocation is already done and how much is still left to go in the FICC bucket and the IB bucket and the financing bucket? Marty Chavez : So, we have had hiring in FICC, net hiring. And as we\u2019ve mentioned, our lateral hiring rate is up significantly, it doubled from prior year levels. But really net, there is very little effect in headcounts. Where we have made some of these hiring investments particularly is in engineering. That is a leading part of our strategy as we\u2019re executing on these growth initiatives, not only the super important detail of having the metrics and dashboards for all of it, but just not just extending our current workflows, but redesigning them, building them with digital channels in addition to the historic voice channel. This is a big part of it. And so, as we mentioned, you\u2019ve begun to see some of this. I\u2019m not going to break out headcounts, because really it makes more sense to see it holistically. So, for instance, as we build out some of these platforms and we\u2019re investing for growth, in many cases, we\u2019re capitalizing the development of that software. And then, once we place it in service, we\u2019re going to be depreciating expense. Over the course of three years, you\u2019ve begun to see some of that flow through into our non-comp line for various initiatives, not just the multiple regulatory initiatives that we had last year, whether it\u2019s MiFID II, initial margin implementation resolution, but also just digitizing our platform generally. And so, really, you have to look at it across all the lines of the business. And actually even though compensation ratio is down 110 basis points 2017 versus 2016, as we mentioned, there is some slight upward pressure on the comp ratio as we\u2019ve made these hiring decisions and people have come on-board. You\u2019ve seen many of the announcements. We\u2019ve hired some very senior people, some -- several partners and we\u2019re extremely excited about their joining us and what they\u2019ve already brought to us in the short time. And so that is a little bit of upward pressure on the comp ratio. But, I would end by saying specifically in banking, we\u2019ve talked about our reach -- our strategy generally, our coverage strategy, which not only has us covering bankers, covering clients in different sectors by bringing on-board coverage people who specialize in those sectors, but also regional. And so in Atlanta, Dallas, Toronto, Seattle, other cities, we\u2019ve hired senior bankers to improve our coverage of mid-sized corporates and all of those activities are off to a good start. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, what I\u2019m hearing is, you\u2019re largely -- you\u2019ve got the resources in place to execute on the plan? Marty Chavez : Yes, we do. Betsy Graseck : And then, second question, just on earnings disclosure. I know, a lot of other folks put the loans into fixed line. And I\u2019m just wondering, is there any thought to either changing your disclosing, the I&L versus the FICC or integrate in a way that can be more apples to apples to how the rest of the Street discloses? Marty Chavez : So Betsy, we\u2019re always working on our discloser. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m especially focused on and working with team on. And you\u2019re beginning to see bits of that, early days of course. We, for instance, broke out the geographic distribution of revenues, gave you a bit more on the balance sheet, there is a ways to go, of course. And for instance, in HFI loan growth, what you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve talked about HFI loan growth going from 60 -- it\u2019s growing up by $4 billion to 66 overall. And in our upcoming 10-K, we\u2019re going to be breaking that down further for you and going into all of the drivers quarter-on-quarter. So there is that. But of course, anything that we can do to have more comparability, it\u2019s valuable to us; we know it\u2019s value to you; and we know that you\u2019re focused on it and we are too. So, it\u2019s work in progress. Betsy Graseck : And then, just lastly on the buyback for 1H 2018. I get the point that it\u2019s a bit of a moving target. What I got from the earlier conversation was largely based on how the CCAR test comes out, is that a fair takeaway? And if so, if the CCAR test global shock in particular was similar to last year, does that -- can you give us a sense as to what kind of buybacks you\u2019d have in that scenario? Marty Chavez : So, Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t want to predict how CCAR is going to evolve. There is, as you know, many inputs and complexities to it. And of course, we are constantly engaged with the fed in understanding how they are thinking about all aspects of it, how they\u2019re going to treat DTAs for instance relating to tax reform and the remeasurement of them, how they are going to treat the new provisions for NOL. All of these are complex moving parts. But of course, the biggest driver is ultimately the severity of the test and the macro shock, and that\u2019s with the fed, and we\u2019ll receive it. And so, I don\u2019t think it makes any sense to speculate on how the test is, except to say that we understand it, we put a lot of work into implementing it and having an extraordinary and robust firm-wide process for running the test and understanding how it affects all parts of our business. I would just say that -- we\u2019ve got this one-time effect of tax legislation. We outlined for you a roughly 70 basis-point reduction in the capital ratios related to that. Having strong capital position to deploy for our clients and wherever we see opportunities is a crucial part of our strategy. And so, that\u2019s why we are thinking about the pace that we outlined for you, $5 billion to $6 billion, similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past few years. And also, given the one-time effect of tax legislation that we just went through our financials in the fourth quarter, thought the actual payments happen over eight years, we are going to be focused on having those capital ratios be robust in the next few quarters. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : So, first, just a couple questions on trying to figure out what\u2019s one-time and not. You guys had a loss -- you highlighted a loss on I&L tied to a secured loan. Was that related to Steinhoff and was there any other impact to Steinhoff in any other of the trading lines? And can you talk about how much of the 4Q we should think about as one-time and therefore what\u2019s the right jumping off point? Because ex legal, it was pretty substantially above where you\u2019ve been running. So, just trying to unpack some of that commentary? Marty Chavez : Sure, Brennan. So, in the prepared part, wanted to just come right, I mentioned that we took a $130 million loss on a single structured loan and that was Steinhoff. And I know one of the -- well, let\u2019s compare and contrast. So, we took full mark on that position. And it\u2019s very public who participated in that loan and at what levels. And we presented that loss in debt I&L others have presented it in slightly different places. And as for the second part of your question, do we have other exposures in and around Steinhoff, the answer is no. Brennan Hawken : And then, as far as non-comp expense goes, it was a pretty elevated level. I know you made some reference to investments that you guys are making, but it also seems -- I know, you laid out $127 million donation, so obviously that\u2019s one-time. It seems like there is some accelerated depreciation and what have you. Is there -- are we better off looking at 3Q as the jumping off point for non-comp or is some of the uplift quarter-over-quarter reflective of investment and what have you? Just trying to think about what the right jump off point is? Marty Chavez : Sure, Brennan. So, the -- of course, as you identified, we made the traditional fourth quarter allocation to Goldman Sachs Gives and so that is a very big part of the sequential comparison. But rather than look at third quarter or fourth quarter, much more relevant for your analysis and for the way we\u2019re thinking about the business to look at full year. And so, full year, it\u2019s up 5%, in line with the revenue growth and that was all deliberate. This is something that we look at every day and every week, of course. And it\u2019s importantly the annual increase is driven by investments to fund the growth plan that we outlined for you. And so, I\u2019ll break it down this way and say that the growth, the full year on full year growth was really balanced across these three areas. So, the first is investments in Marcus, something that we\u2019ve talked a fair bit about, huge and important and exciting area of growth for us and one of the pillars of our growth plan. And then second part of the year-on-year growth in non-comp was consolidated investment entity expenses. So, as we make investments, some of them for accounting purposes, need to be consolidated on our balance sheet. And so, you\u2019ll see their expenses show up there. And then, the third part is on technology and consulting. We\u2019ve always had an overweight to engineering, as you know, and building software. And that\u2019s served us in great stead over many, many decades and we continue to do that. The way in which we make those investments is evolving. We now have a large emphasis on using and especially participating in and contributing to and creating open source. And so, the nature of it has changed. But yes, there is a -- in that growth year-on-year, there is supporting regulatory implementation. Some of those activities are behind us such as initial margin, no parts of it continue. MiFID II, the big bang on MiFID II go live has already happened, as you know, but there is ongoing work. Really across the firm, there is investments in technology to improve efficiency and scale. And also in that line, there is more software and service. So, as I mentioned briefly, we build the software, capitalize some of the expense and then as it gets deployed, we\u2019re depreciating it ratably over three years. And so you\u2019re seeing in that line some of those effect as well. And it\u2019s something that we expect and embrace and we\u2019re investing for growth and pivoting to executing on the growth plan and delivering earnings growth that non-comp growth proceeds revenue generation. But, I can assure you that we will not lose the historic discipline that we have here on cost management. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : I just wanted to follow up on expenses and in particular the comp ratio. As you\u2019ve pointed out, you showed a lot of discipline in getting the comp ratio down by a little bit over a percent, despite the investments that you\u2019re making. And I was just wondering should we expect that that could keep going in say a 5% revenue growth environment like what you had last year, should we expect that the comp ratio would come down again meaningfully or with the acceleration of some of the investments in the initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out. Should we expect that that improvement in the comp ratio could stall? Marty Chavez : So, we talk about it and it\u2019s just a core part of how we operate, which is operating leverage. So, as revenues increase, of course, we want to see pretax EPS, everything increasing faster. And that is a core part of how we operate. And as we\u2019re building out on the growth initiatives, I can\u2019t emphasize enough that of course talent, our people are at the core of everything we do. Paying for performance, inspiring the best people to be here, attracting and retaining them is the core part of the strategy and also, going along with that supporting it having great engineers and leading with digital platforms and automated workflows, not just extending the current workflows. And so, of course we\u2019re investing in that. But yes, as we build out these new initiatives and these new work flows and do them in a modern way, you will continue to see operating leverage flow through. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, just as a follow-up on some of the questions before on I&L and in particular the equity investing line. Do you have any early thoughts on the impact of Basel IV on the -- which I know is an informal term, but the changes in the Basel risk weighting on the RWAs and therefore the capital that are associated with the assets in I&L with some of these private equity investments? It seems like the potential impacts there are quite significant. Marty Chavez : So, I will just say, Basel III, as it continues to evolve, of course, we\u2019re close to all of those activities that happened in the back half of last year. And as you know, many of the implementation and roll out timeframes were changed and significantly the Basel committee left room for a great deal of more work on calibrations of various kinds but -- and standardizing elsewhere. And fundamental review of the trading book continues to be -- there is parts of it, the calibration that remain open and we think that that\u2019s appropriate and wise. But as to how this is all going to arise for us, I won\u2019t speculate on it until the calibrations evolve, we see how the 72.5% floor relates to the Collins but most importantly, the NPR that we\u2019ll actually implement this in the U.S. Guy Moszkowski : So, too early to do much there? Marty Chavez : Yes. Guy Moszkowski : And then, just one final follow-up on the comment that you made about the consolidated entities impacting your non-personnel expense growth. Are largely all of those consolidated entities I&L investment entities or is there something else? Marty Chavez : They\u2019re I&L entities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hey, Marty. So, I wanted to kick things off with a question on FICC pricing. It was something you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You noted that the tightening of the bid offer was a source of fee pressure in the quarter. And I have heard others allude to that as well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us some color as to what specific factors drove that contraction in spreads. I\u2019m just trying to gauge how much of that\u2019s ephemeral versus a function of maybe increased competition which may persist going forward? Marty Chavez : Yes. So, that is one of the many important questions. We generally notice that at low levels, for instance of interest rates, but also at low level of volatility, it\u2019s -- we\u2019ll see this effect, bid offer compression. And it makes sense. So, if the clients are active, they\u2019re looking to buy and sell, then there is generally more volatility and those activities, those two phenomena can reinforce one another. But, when there isn\u2019t much movement, it makes sense that the bid offer would compress. And as for whether it\u2019s ephemeral, whether it\u2019s secular or cyclic, extremely hard to assess that. As rates break out of their range bound levels, as the tenure yields on a variety of govies start moving around, perhaps we\u2019ll have an opportunity to get more answers to that question. But, as we say all the time and it\u2019s really how we think and act, rather than predict what\u2019s ephemeral and what\u2019s not and what\u2019s going to change and when, it\u2019s important to be prepared for all of these eventualities and to build optionality for them. So, one of the many things we\u2019re doing on this front and it\u2019s one of the topics that I mentioned when I talked about how our various engineering activities are transforming all of the businesses of the firm not confined to any one business. But there is a huge emphasis in our market-making businesses where we\u2019ve always had this kind of strat engineering activity and had an overweight to that. And so, let\u2019s look for instance at the equity markets. Commissions over the last 18 years have declined to very small percentage of where they were and yet that business continues to thrive. And there, one of the contributors in addition to just having great talent is the automated platform that we\u2019ve built for systematic market-making and for trading out of risk in that environment where, in that case, could commissions, but could equally be bid offer spreads are reducing. This is generating better results for our clients especially and also for shareholders. Well, why confine that activity which is something that is historical strength of ours to equities. And so, we\u2019ve been bringing that to all of our FICC businesses, most obviously businesses such as foreign exchange, but not stopping at foreign exchange. And so, we formed last year a group within our securities division, our ICS business, called security systemic solutions, which is extending these approaches across all of our businesses. And really taking a consistent approach in FICC and equities, which is execution, services, capital, content, analytics, increasingly sharing that directly with clients, digitally extending it over the web and taking this platform such that we\u2019ve had for years and building it out to our clients. That\u2019s a key part of the strategy and builds optionality for variety states of the world. If the bid offer compression trends out to be ephemeral, then having done all this will make it even better. And if it turns out to be more persistent, we\u2019ll have a plan in place. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that color, Marty. I mean, admittedly, a lot of the debate has been around whether some of those efforts to take what you learned from the equities paradigm and apply that to more homogenous products, like FX, where there\u2019s been a great degree of success. I think there is a little bit more skepticism as to whether that success can be replicated with more heterogeneous products like corporate credit, but just curious to see whether you think that that distinction is an important one? Marty Chavez : We have a strong view on that one. So, I think historically, you would often hear people say, well, all this works great for equities or homogeneous products. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s just FICC. But how is it going to work, when you got so many different CUSIPs, instead of just one stock CUSIP for the company, that same company might have 600 bond CUSIPs. And so, what I will note there is that equities, I\u2019m not so sure that it\u2019s all that homogeneous. When you look at small caps and when you look at the large number of listed option instruments on every strike and every tender, on every underlying and all of the different product formats that you see an equity, everything from cash to derivatives to systemic trading strategies to EPS, there is an awful lot of right in complexity in equities. And as to this factor of 600 to 1 or so on bond CUSIPs to equity CUSIPs, one thing, and this is the computer scientist in me, would just say, well that\u2019s something that Moore\u2019s law more and the doubling of compute power every 18 to 24 months compounding over decades, the computers catch up and can handle that extra complexity. So, really, I would say to package all that up is that we\u2019ve always been a leader in our engineering, in our math and software capability. And that\u2019s an important contributor to all of our businesses that is one of the pillars together with the bankers and the traders and the sales people and everyone in the federation, all of our people. But that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to continue to lead with and differentiate ourselves in. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Maybe just to come back here on FICC again. It seems like a lot of conversations and even on the call today we\u2019re talking a lot about volatility in the industry, volatility recover. But, I guess my question is should we be careful what we ask for? Because it seems that this kind of benign backdrop that we\u2019ve been in here recently has been good for other businesses. And so, how should we think about volatility and the mix of what that means for all of Goldman Sachs? Is it a way mean reversion of volatility and that\u2019s good for the whole business or is this actually environment what you\u2019re seeing the benefits of the diversification of the firm, kind of the natural head to your business? I am just trying to think about that because it comes up quite a bit. Marty Chavez : Well, of course, it\u2019s always the right amounts of volatility and organized around trends that draw active investors in who see also generation opportunities. That\u2019s always the goldilocks scenario. And of course, we have observed and so have others that there can be a countercyclical nature to the FICC business. But really that\u2019s just another of saying if you\u2019ve got a diversified set of businesses, then, well, of course, one would love all of the businesses to all perform well. At the same time, if they all went up 18% year-on-year for instance as the banking segment did, then you -- over time you\u2019d have to ask yourself whether really all of that uncorrelated and diversified. So, volatility generally, just uncertainty, we are in that business; that is the core of our business. And you can imagine in some hypothetical state that we don\u2019t see and is extraordinarily unlikely, there was no volatility and everything just stayed the same forever. In that kind of environment, there wouldn\u2019t be much to do on any of our businesses or anyone\u2019s business really. And so, while there\u2019s always puts and takes, and it\u2019s difficult to foresee exactly how diversified and uncorrelated businesses are going to play out, in any environment that kind of uncertainty, we can engage with clients and share content and insights with them. And when they have risk they don\u2019t want or want risk that they don\u2019t have, we\u2019re there to provide. That is generally a good backdrop for all of our businesses. Devin Ryan : Got it. Thank you. And then, a quick follow-up here. Goldman has obviously been innovator in the industry over time. And so, I am just curious how the thinking is evolved on crypto currencies as an opportunity? What the process in terms of thinking about getting into a business like that would be? And I know it\u2019s a small asset class but obviously, you talk about an area with plenty of volatility and not being over saturated yet. So, just curious, current thoughts there. Marty Chavez : So, crypto currencies, it\u2019s so much of the moment of the zeitgeist. Last time I checked, which was last week, there were 1,300 crypto currencies, I am sure there\u2019s way more today. And so, that\u2019s just something that\u2019s happening. At the same time, also important to step back, really a million years ago when I was a grad student in computer science, this problem that\u2019s at the core crypto currencies is an old, old one. We used to call it the Byzantine Generals Problem. It\u2019s really been around for decades. And the problem is, how do you get a bunch of people who are not necessarily coordinated and not necessarily reliable and don\u2019t necessarily have great communication all to agree on shared reality. And so, what is especially interesting about Bitcoin is that someone -- there is some group of people, we don\u2019t know exactly who they were, presented a particularly elegant solution to this relatively old problem and they made a specific application of this problem. How do you agree, how do you get a bunch of people to agree on who paid what to whom. And so, that\u2019s the distributed general ledger. Really the way we\u2019re thinking about this whole area is that it\u2019s really a much bigger topic, it\u2019s really the blockchain or the distributed general ledger that is of great and very broad application potentially. And we\u2019re always talking about cloud services and APIs and open software as major drivers of innovation not just for the industry, but also for us. I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if in a few years we reliably add blockchain to that list of important drivers of innovation. So, we really want to distinguish the blockchain which is in area of huge emphasis and investments across our industry and across many industries from a particular application of blockchain which tends to get all the news, cycles which is cryptal currencies. So, having distinguished those two, let\u2019s talk a little bit about crypto currencies. Now, it\u2019s well known, it\u2019s some of the exchanges have introduced contracts, better referenced to Bitcoin. And who knows what other kinds of crypto currencies or baskets of crypto currencies, they may come out with products on. And so, on the back of our clients asking us, will you offer clearing in these contracts? Well, we\u2019re in that business of client facilitation. And so, we want a response to those client requests, and we have. And we\u2019re in also the businesses of being careful with our shareholders\u2019 capital. And so, we\u2019re doing that with extreme, prudence and caution as we learn. Now, the broader question of will there be trading in these instruments that are linked to Bitcoin, there is just a huge number of topics to address and being a part of the industry, we\u2019re working on all of that. Custody is a part of it and it\u2019s a very complex one. So, it\u2019s really too early to say how that will evolve for the industry or for ourselves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Please go ahead. Andrew Lim : So, for commodities, obviously you\u2019ve downsized the business. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much by and perhaps maybe you could say within the full year 2016 commodity revenue context, how much of those revenues have been downsized by? Marty Chavez : So, I won\u2019t break it out exactly that way, Andrew. But, one way to think about the business is really to step back and look at the full year. So, in the full year, four out of the five FICC businesses are down, one of them which is relatively smaller for us, which is mortgages business, was up. And we talked about many others in the industry since it is a broad phenomenon, have talked about low volatility, low client activity, tighter credit spreads, tighter bid offer spreads playing through and all of those areas. But here is something I will quantify for you. I did it on the last call, you\u2019ll recall that last quarter, I mentioned that if you compared nine months on nine months, half of the FICC\u2019s decline was attributable to our commodities business. If you compare full year 2017 to full year 2016, one-third of the decline in FICC revenues is attributable to our commodities business. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Marty Chavez : Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Morgan Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company Steven Chubak - Nomura Instinet Devin Ryan - JMP Securities Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today April 17, 2018. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm\u2019s belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm\u2019s control. The firm\u2019s actual results and financial conditions may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm\u2019s future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, and supplementary leverage ratio, and you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I will now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez. Marty? Marty Chavez : Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll walk you through our first quarter results and make some brief comments on the broader opportunity set for the firm. Then of course I am happy to answer any questions.  First quarter net revenues of $10 billion were up 25% versus the first quarter of last year. Net earnings of $2.8 billion were up 26%. Earnings per share were $6.95, up 35%. Return on common equity was 15.4% representing our highest quarterly return in over five years. While we are pleased with our strong first quarter performance, it\u2019s we are stepping back to put these results and the environment into context.  The last time we generated over a 15% return the environment was different in several ways. Five years ago, global growth was generally improving but still slow and we were embarking on a period of unprecedented global central bank stimulus. In contrast, the start to 2018 has been characterized by healthy backdrops of synchronized global growth and rising interest rates. Better growth prospects are supporting central bank efforts to reduce stimulus which has been a primary factor driving the below average market volatility seen in recent years. During the first quarter, the positive outlook for global growth translated into improved corporate and investor confidence and subsequently solid activity across the firm, particularly in our Investment Banking and Market Making businesses. Compared to the first quarter of last year, Investment Banking, FICC, Equities, Investing & Lending and Investment Management, each produced net revenue growth with four of the five increasing 18% or more. While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, relatively positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place.  We are pleased with our improved performance in the quarter as it demonstrates the earnings power of our diversified franchise and shows what is possible with modest improvements in the environment and client activity and we believe there is room for additional revenue and earnings growth as we further diversify our global franchise across a broader client base with an expanded suite of products and services. Let\u2019s discuss the individual businesses. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion, 16% lower than a very robust fourth quarter, which was our strongest in over ten years. The decline came amid a lower but still strong underwriting performance and a decrease in advisory revenues.  Financial Advisory revenues were $586 million. The decline relative to the fourth quarter reflects the decrease in a number of completed M&A transactions. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $240 billion. We are optimistic regarding the outlook for higher activity across a number of sectors given new clarity from US tax reform and healthy client dialogues.  Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.2 billion in the first quarter, down 12% from the fourth quarter across equity and debt. Equity underwriting net revenues of $410 million declined 11% driven by lower industry volumes.  In the first quarter, we ranked second globally in equity and equity-related underwriting with $20 billion of deal volume in over 100 transactions. Debt underwriting net revenues were $797 million, the second best quarter ever following last quarter\u2019s record.  Growing debt underwriting has been a long-term priority for the firm and we expect our strong M&A franchise will continue to support robust contribution from acquisition-related financings. Turning to our Investment Banking backlogs, it increased versus both the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2017 driven by M&A volumes and underwriting respectively. As I mentioned, the new tax legislation in the U.S. has added significant clarity for our clients and we continue to work with them to assess and execute a variety of strategic priorities. Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $4.4 billion in the first quarter, up 85% compared to the fourth quarter and up 31% versus the first quarter of last year. In both our FICC and equities franchises, we generated our highest quarterly revenues in three years. Performance was supported by better prospects for global growth and higher market volatility.  This backdrop drove, improved investor confidence, led to higher client engagement across flow and structured transactions, and a broader opportunity set for our franchise. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $2.1 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels reflecting a better operating environment and our efforts to strengthen client relationships. Results were helped by reduced inventory headwinds in certain businesses. We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed income businesses as higher client activity drove a broader opportunity set despite a continued competitive environment with relatively tight bid ask spreads.  We also saw increased activity in areas where we have historical strength including higher activity in derivatives and structured transactions as clients sought to access emerging trends or hedge risks.  Within FICC, commodities increased significantly versus the fourth quarter reflecting improved performance, particularly in natural gas and power. Currencies results reflect better performance in G-10 and the significant improvement in emerging markets compared with a challenging fourth quarter. Rates benefited from higher activity in the U.S. and in Europe where we continue to grow our client footprint.  Credit reflected improved conditions in high yields, investment grades, munis and structured credit and benefited from stronger client activity in flow trading. Mortgages benefited from improved market conditions and better client engagement.  The improvement in FICC was also evident on a year-over-year basis with a significant increase in currencies reflecting strong performance in emerging markets, as well as significantly better results in commodities and credit. We are pleased to see our FICC business improve versus a difficult 2017, which we believe in part represents our continued efforts to expand and diversify our global client franchise. Nonetheless, much work remains to be done and we continue to execute on the billion dollar FICC revenue growth plans we laid out last September.  Turning to Equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 69% sequentially as equity market volatility rebounded globally from record lows driving higher client activity, and the broader opportunity set.  Equities Client Execution net revenues of $1.1 billion rose significantly, driving our highest quarterly performance in three years on stronger results in both cash and derivatives. Commissions and fees net revenues rose 11% to $817 million driven by stronger volumes across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Security Services net revenues of $432 million rose 6% on higher client balances. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the first quarter was $73 million, up from 15 year lows during 2017, but consistent with 2015 levels. The increase was driven primarily by client demand for our balance sheet. In many ways, we view rebounding VaR as a positive development and indicative of an improving opportunity set.  Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these franchises produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter. Our Investing & Lending balance sheet ended the quarter at $129 billion, up $8 billion versus last quarter. It is comprised of approximately $106 billion in loans, debt securities and other assets and $23 billion in private and public equity investments.  Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. Approximately 55% of our performance was from mark-to-market on public securities and events such as sales in our private portfolio. Our global equity portfolio was $23 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with over 900 different investments. Our performance continues to be driven by an investment discipline that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns applied by global teams of over 400 investment professionals and supported by our dedicated risk management and controls infrastructure.  Regarding our equity investment portfolio, it is diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage. Approximately 30% of the portfolio is held in investments made in 2011 or earlier. Roughly 30% is from investments made between 2012 and 2014 and about 40% is from investments made over the last three years.  The balance and diversification coupled with our disciplined investments approach should help support further \u2013 future contributions from these businesses through the cycle. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were robust $1 billion. Results included over $550 million of net interest income, which continues to grow as we seek to increase more recurring revenue streams.  Results also included mark-to-market gains driven by underlying credit fundamentals and specific events from roughly 100 loans and securities. No single name was a significant contributor to the results. Our lending strategy remains focused on providing financing to support and expand our existing clients including in Investment Banking, Investment Management and ICS. Our strategy is also focused on applying core competencies of Goldman Sachs, collateral and asset valuation and risk management. We also continue to prudently expand our lending to new client segments, primarily through our Marcus consumer platform, which includes digital lending, and deposits.  Since launch, markets has originated approximately $3 billion of consumer loans. We continued to emphasize credit worthy customers and the credit quality of our portfolio is performing in line with expectations. Additionally, our retail deposits, which were $9 billion at the acquisition of the GE business, exceeded $20 billion in March. We are pleased with the progress we are making on strategic initiatives within our consumer franchise. Our long-term vision for markets is to create the leading platform for millions of consumers to take control of their financial lives offering personalized products to save and borrow better simple, transparence and provide value to customers.  Last week, we closed the acquisition of Clarity Money. This is an important next step and certainly not the last in creating a business that marshals technology to put power over personal finances fast in the hands of consumers.  Moving to Investment Management. We produced record revenues in the first quarter driven by our diversified global asset management business and differentiated private wealth management franchise. Net revenues were $1.8 billion including relatively stable management and other fees. The 6% sequential increase reflected higher incentive fees, driven by Harvest King. We also grew transaction revenues by 28% driven primarily by higher TWM client activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $4 billion versus the fourth quarter driven by $13 billion of long-term net inflows across fixed income and equity partially offset by $5 billion of liquidity product outflows and $4 billion of market depreciation. Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization to prior year equity warrants and other items such as benefits, and our compensation to net revenues ratio of 41% was consistent with the first quarter of 2017. Non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, down slightly versus the fourth quarter and up 14% versus the year ago.  Higher non-compensation expenses versus the first quarter of last year reflects both higher client activity and our investments in future growth. There were three main drivers. Approximately, $150 million was driven by higher client activity, which increased brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees.  Approximately $100 million comes from a variety of investments to drive growth including Marcus, and consolidated investments and approximately $50 million of the increase was related to an accounting change for certain transaction costs.  Next on taxes. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was approximately 17%. The quarter included a $203 million income tax benefit related to share-based compensation. Excluding this benefit, our underlying tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%, slightly lower than the long-term expectation of 24% we stated last quarter given transition rules effected for 2018. We will provide further updates as we continue to evaluate ongoing guidance from treasury.  Turning to balance sheet, liquidity and capital. Our global core liquid assets averaged $229 billion during the quarter. Our balance sheet was $974 billion, up 6% versus last quarter driven by increased client activity and demand for our balance sheet. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity tier-1 ratio was 12.1% using the standardized approach and 11.1% under the Basel III advanced approach. The ratios improved by 20 and 40 basis points respectively on a sequential basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.7%.  In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of $800 million and approximately $300 million in common stock dividends. Additionally, our Board approved a7% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.80 per share beginning in the second quarter. Given current capital levels and the opportunities we see to support our client franchise, we do not expect to execute share repurchases in the second quarter and will use earnings to support future investments. We have been transparent our growth plans and there is a clear demand from clients for our balance sheet, which provides an opportunity to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.  Nevertheless, over the medium-term, we continue to believe our historical repurchase level of approximately $5 billion to $6 billion per CCAR cycle is a reasonable expectation.  Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While we are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, we continued to diversify our client footprint and the breadth of products and services we offer. We believe successful implementation of these initiatives will provide further upside to additional revenue and earnings growth for the firm.  Regarding our $5 billion in growth initiatives, we track our progress in a detailed and comprehensive way mapping not just the specific revenues generated from each initiative, but many key performance indicators that will provide insight into our progress.  Today, we are pleased to share that our performance is tracking in line or better than our goals. Of course, the results will be more back-end loaded and our plan and progress reflects that expectation. Looking forward, we continue to make significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses. As we\u2019ve discussed, our significant investments in technology underpins all of our efforts. We also continue to emphasize producing higher revenues from more recurring sources such as Investment Management, and Lending generating significant operating leverage and diversifying the long-term earnings profile of the firm.  We believe these efforts will continue to position us to create long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, thanks again for dialing in. I will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Marty. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Christian. Christian Bolu : Just first off on Equities, so similar to peers, very strong numbers here. The worry is always sustainability. I know you do have some growth initiatives around electronic trading and you won the Bloomberg Trade Book business last year. Just curious how much of 1Q's strength was pay-off from growth initiatives versus just the episodic volatility backdrop during the quarter? And then how should we think about sustainability in that business going forward? Marty Chavez : So, Christian, client activity was the major driver of the year-on-year increase. The vol spike, particularly at the beginning of February was a positive contributor to the Equities\u2019 P&L, but again client activity was the major driver and it would have been a strong quarter without the long volatility benefits. The environment lined up well for our franchise as you know, we\u2019ve got franchise diversified across the products and geographies and really in the quarter, we saw the benefits of that. The performance was strong across flow and structured products, across cash and derivatives, across geographies, and all the business lines when delta derivatives and prime there was really broad based improvement where the volatility created a robust market-making backdrop and the clients were active and we executed well.  You referenced the growth initiatives and of course our investments in Equities growth is an important part of those initiatives. It\u2019s \u2013 you also referenced Bloomberg Trade Book which brought on 1300 new clients and that\u2019s got some revenue runrate associated with it and we\u2019ve been onboarding low touch and quant clients in connection with the new product services and platforms we\u2019ve been developing.  It\u2019s early days in that onboarding, but also important to note that these offerings, electronic trading tools, analytics are valuable not just to the quant and systematic clients, but to our traditional clients as well. Bottom-line, the franchise does well when clients are active. Christian Bolu : Great, thanks. On the regulatory front, I guess the Fed put out a couple of NPRs around SLR and stress capital buffer, the off-shut feels like leverage could potentially no longer be constrained or a binding factor for your business. So curious how we should think about the opportunity set for Goldman, especially growing some of the lower ROE businesses to the extent leverage is no longer a constraint? Marty Chavez : Our initial read of the notices of proposed rulemaking from the Fed last week, I\u2019ll start with ESLR, it\u2019s clear from the rule \u2013 the proposed rule that SLR is likely to return to its intended purpose originally which was serving as a back stop to the risk-based requirements as opposed to being in itself a binding requirement.  While it seems likely that SLR will be less binding, we are of course still going to consider it holistically in our approach to capital allocation generally perhaps with the less \u2013 lesser weight. Of course, we will see how it\u2019s going to evolve and all of this has to \u2013 how the businesses evolve and responses that we make in demand from the clients is a dynamic process. As for the stress capital buffer proposal, also last week, we are not surprised by it. It\u2019s been well highlighted and outlined by the Fed in multiple conversations with the market, as well as white papers and we are supportive of the Fed\u2019s stated goal which is to simplify the capital framework and connect the stress capital and spot requirements.  The regulator has also been very clear that it is a proposal and that they are open to feedback and they are inviting the feedbacks and we will take all of that under advisement as they works through finalizing the rules.  Based on the proposal, we would expect stress capital buffer to be the binding constraint and we will continue what we\u2019ve been doing for a long time now which is dynamically allocating our scarce resources, optimizing under all of these constraints as they evolve with the goal always of growing the franchise driving returns. We have a history of responding to new constraints and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Christian Bolu : Great. And then just one last clean up question for me. On the non-comp side, thanks for that breakdown between brokerage, investment and accounts. It\u2019s very helpful. How should we think about the right jump of point? Is it the $2.5 billion this quarter of non-comp, less the 150 of volume-driven cost and that\u2019s a, kind of a good number for us to think about the forward \u2013 kind of the forward non-comp trajectory? Marty Chavez : Chris, and I encourage you to think of the recent level of expenses as indicative of the future level, given our commitment to growth and the growth initiatives that we have outlined that we are executing on. But having said that, of course, our commitments to delivering positive operating leverage to the shareholders is as firm as ever and you saw some of that play through in the first quarter results with EPS and pretax up 35% and non-comps up 14%. We welcome that dynamic. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Marty Chavez : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hey, Marty. How are you? Marty Chavez : Good, thanks. Glenn Schorr : First one on I&L. I definitely appreciate the extra color that you gave. And I don\u2019t know how better to ask this, every capital market in the world is down, not a lot, but down 1% to 4%, call it. But it seems like your private is both on the equity and debt side, obviously has other things going on, so you produce like the best gains in like five years.  I am curious as to what we can learn to get towards that and more importantly what we can do going forward to get more credit? Because, if you look at it, your I&L line has been great for five years and we keep not getting enough credit in there. So I am searching for help on how to both explain it and particularly on the equity side. Marty Chavez : So, I\u2019ll start with equities and happy to go in any direction you like it in Equity, I&L. The key to that business is, diversification. It\u2019s a global portfolio and it\u2019s diversified across sectors, across geographies, both private equity, also real estate. And the other key to it is a franchise business. We have sourcing capabilities that are driven by a global network and investing as we\u2019ve been demonstrating with these results remains long-term emphasis as well as a core competency.  I gave you the vintage breakdown. And what I would say is that in this quarter, we clearly saw the results of excellent environment for harvesting and we\u2019ve been actively harvesting both to maximize value for our investors and then also as to comply with the regulations. We also talked a little bit about the drivers, 50% of it was from mark-to-market on public securities for events.  For instance, sales in the private portfolio, but really the key to it is that we have [attractive] [ph] sourcing mechanism and it\u2019s finding great businesses and working with them to operate them and make them better and of course, that\u2019s been driving not only the results you seen in this quarter and prior quarters, the long-term book value for us. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Got all that. Thank you. Curious on \u2013 I guess, this holds on to the labor corporate relationship\u2019s full umbrella. I guess, I\u2019d love to hear you talk about the full suite of products that you \u2013 think you either have now or will be \u2013 obviously you are picking up on the lending fronts and trading, but, it has been talked about building on a suite of cash management products. So, maybe if you could just put that whole package together, that would be helpful? Marty Chavez : There is \u2013 as we\u2019ve mentioned in the growth plan, a number of initiatives across the firm and where do I start? So, what remains constant across all of them is the risk management, infrastructure that we\u2019ve got and the disciplined approach to managing scarce resources. I\u2019ll call out a few of the activities under the growth plan. In FICC, we\u2019ve increased our corporate derivatives mandates.  In Equities, as I touched on before, we\u2019ve been onboarding clients, continuing to invest in execution services and infrastructure. There is some exciting developments that are driven out of equities, but actually, we are now broadening and applying across FICC as well building electronic tools, that are portals for our clients where we abstract and take the concepts of risk transfer very generally and show our clients all the different possible ways where they can effect risk transfer from agency to principals systematic across different product wrappers. There is so many ways to do it and really making that transparent and simple and digital for our clients. It\u2019s a huge effort that\u2019s underway.  In Investment Banking, we\u2019ve assigned coverage on over 500 of the 1000 targeted clients and you\u2019ve all seen announcements of a number of senior bankers who\u2019ve joined us recently. I called out the inflows in our Investment Management business and also to say a little bit on Marcus, the funded loan balance is about $2.4 billion, originations through the end of the first quarter life-to-date approximately $3 billion and you also know of the announcement of Clarity Money\u2019s \u2013 after the acquisition of Clarity Money, which closed on Friday and there Clarity Money is a digital app that aligns with what we\u2019ve been doing already in Marcus.  Simplicity, transparency, a great experience for the clients and you can expect to continue to see us making investments to create adjacent businesses built around that digital app and that digital experience. And as we are doing all of this, we are doing it in a flexible way, where it allows us to move into all kinds of adjacencies, you mentioned cash management, which is an important opportunity and one that we are evaluating and exploring.  In Ayco, that\u2019s another example of providing executive counseling to the senior executives in Fortune-1000 companies there. We\u2019ve been effective at growing the number of Ayco\u2019s client companies, as well as using digital tools and platforms to offer Ayco\u2019s services to more people inside the Ayco client companies. With all these activities have in common is delivering the entire firm and using our long-term strength in engineering to do this in a scalable and digitized way. Glenn Schorr : Okay. So you are not doing much. Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Michael. Michael Carrier : Hi, Marty. Marty, just, I guess, a question on client content and activity levels both in banking and trading, like the industry, we always have kind of a seasonal lift in the first quarter. We\u2019ve gotten the tax reform and rising rates and on the flip side, we\u2019ve got some trade work and churns, flatter yield curves, so where do you see if there is things that you can point to in the business metrics, client balances activity?  Whether it\u2019s in banking or trading that makes you think that the \u2013 beyond potential that you are better this year over the next couple of years, that\u2019s different versus the past year is where we\u2019ve seen kind of the 1Q bounce and then back to kind of muted activity levels? Marty Chavez : Michael, one way to think about it is to compare this quarter to the last time we had results in both FICC and Equities at these levels. And I\u2019d just start by saying, but clear and stable across these businesses is that our clients respond to macro growth and market dynamics dispersion across asset classes and they respond by being more active. So let\u2019s look at some of the drivers in this first quarter versus the first quarter of 2015. Now of course, no predictions here, just contingency planning, but the drivers, having said that are quite different this time around. So this time we\u2019ve got globally synchronized economic growth. It\u2019s been a little while since we had that. We had rising U.S. rates and stronger labor markets.  We\u2019ve got U.S. tax reform now behind us and one could easily imagine that those are more durable drivers than, say, what we saw in the first quarter of 2015 in the first quarter you recall there were some events such as the Swiss Central Bank depegging from the euro.  There was an expectation of rising rates, but rates didn\u2019t actually rise until the back half of the year and then there was the initiation of quantitative easing from the European Central Bank and generally that\u2019s after some initial repositioning associated with dampening market volatility. So, those are some of the things that are different. Going over to our Investment Banking business, there is a related set of dynamics, where, as I mentioned the backlog is up year-on-year. It\u2019s up sequentially and in retrospect with tax reform behind us it\u2019s now more clear that that\u2019s some corporations were waiting for clarity on tax reform to proceed. And so, the dialogue is strong.  Announced M&A is up and it takes a while for those announced M&As as you know to play through into completed M&A transactions and therefore into revenues, but it will note that across those sectors, yes, there are concerns about tariffs, trade wars and so on. But the activity and dialogue is strong. It\u2019s difficult to predict \u2013 impossible to predict what these drivers will be in the future. And so, we keep the focus on what we can do here which is to position ourselves to support the clients in whatever they are going to do. Michael Carrier : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe one on the regulatory ratios. So just given, where your CET-1 is today in your comments on the buyback outlook. Just wanted to get a sense when you look at kind of the demand for the balance sheet and the opportunities for growth, whether it\u2019s on the institutional \u2013 the trading side or what you are dealing like the lending side. Do you have, kind of what you need meaning, can you hit the growth targets comfortably and still manage to the capital ratios with the buybacks that you suggested? Marty Chavez : Yes, so, to give you that buyback expectation and then to reaffirm it in this quarter and also in pace of our growth plan which we\u2019ve known and we\u2019ve shared the outlines of it sometime ago. All \u2013 plus the notice of proposed rulemaking that have come from the Fed, we\u2019ve been taking all of those factors into account. And of course there is uncertainties and it\u2019s evolving and dynamic and there is going to be a lot of discussion next \u2013 on those sixty days that the Fed has invited with the industry on stressed capital buffer and so there will likely be some evolution there as the rule makes its way into the final state. And so, all of these things are moving and when we gave the growth plan, and the $5 billion to $6 billion expectation of share repurchases per CCAR cycle, we very much had what we thought possible for the stress capital buffer proposal in our minds when we proposed and adopted our internal capital management planning, which ensures that we are dynamically managing capital moving it around on behalf of the clients to where the highest return opportunities are for our shareholders.  So, we have all of these things in mind when we gave those. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we have the resources and the plan to be well-capitalized and to serve the clients and to execute on the growth plan. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Marty Chavez : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor : Good morning. I want to follow-up on the Investment Banking piece, stronger than what we are seeing at peers and especially in the DCM, debt capital markets area, you alluded to the share gains there apart from some of the build out in recent years. But just hoping you could elaborate a little bit maybe specifically this quarter what drove DCM and I guess a follow-up question while now it \u2013 you mentioned the pipelines is up versus year-end, and maybe give a little color in terms of which areas were stronger within the businesses? Thank you. Marty Chavez : So, on debt underwriting, let\u2019s step back and look at how we got here to this near record quarter after a record quarter. It\u2019s a priority that we identified as strategic priority really almost ten years ago. And you are seeing the results of that and the consistent execution across weeks, months, quarters, years in building that business and there in that business, you saw in this quarter what is the key driver and the differentiator of the business compared to the debt underwriting businesses in the peer group, which is that we identified our core strengths which we all know in M&A and we built the debt underwriting business around that core strength. And so, it\u2019s really M&A as the driver for demand for the issuance and you are seeing the results flow through into revenues. The strategy over this period and continuing to now has remained stable which is giving advice, giving our clients access to capital markets and then applying everything we know and do about risk management to this business and doing it all in the context of strong franchise.  In this quarter, acquisition finance activity drove nearly half of the revenues in debt underwriting. As for notable transactions, I am very pleased to say that we were a leader in CVS\u2019s $40 billion bond issuance to fund the acquisition of Aetna.  Bottom-line I would say, M&A is the driver of sequential improvement in the backlog and the results that you are seeing in the business. Matt O\u2019Connor : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just on the backlog of overall Investment Banking being up versus year-end, maybe some additional color in terms of what areas are stronger, what region, any additional thoughts you can provide there? Marty Chavez : Sure. What\u2019s notable about banking dialogue is that it\u2019s global. It\u2019s happening in all the geographies and it\u2019s happening in all of the sectors. You can see from some of the announced M&A which sectors are really active, but it\u2019s really across the board. It\u2019s in healthcare, it\u2019s in natural resources, it\u2019s in media, very broad based. Matt O\u2019Connor : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. How much of the $5 billion in growth initiatives have you achieved? Marty Chavez : I\u2019m not going to give you the revenue number itself. It\u2019s early days. When we built the plan to get to $5 billion over three years, it\u2019s back-end loaded. Certainly not ratable over the twelve quarters and so we\u2019ve built in a slope there. But what I will say in this early quarter, the second quarter after we laid out the growth plan, it\u2019s the revenue is tracking according to the internal goals that we set for ourselves. Mike Mayo : Let me ask a different question. How much do you have in tech spending for 2018? And how does that compare to say, 2017 or 2016? I am not sure if you\u2019ve disclosed that in the past. Marty Chavez : We don\u2019t, Mike, break out our tech spending. What I would say about tech spending generally is \u2013 there is really two components of it, which of course people, that\u2019s the major component. And then also, all of the other platforms, cyber security and so on that go along with it, which we call the managed spend. In the growth initiatives, which we\u2019ve highlighted, the seven growth initiatives whether it\u2019s the corporate derivative mandates, it\u2019s what we are doing to quantum systematic clients.  In Investment Banking, there is a lot going on there. For instance, automating the buildings of company models and doing merger math by pairs and doing that at scale across all possible pairs and identifying opportunities for our clients. Whether it\u2019s Investment Management components of the $1billion growth initiatives in Investment Management, about a third of it is in our Ayco Executive Counseling business, the digital platforms there in markets there.  The key has been all digital, no manual intervention, no spreadsheets in the workflows and that continues to be core to the philosophy there. So, when you look at all of those initiatives, you can see that they all have engineering and in engineering, we are going to be doing some capitalizing of the expenses as we build up these platforms.  Make sure that we build them without over-engineering them in a way that\u2019s shareable across businesses and geographies. And so, yes, the demand for more software, more math is up across the board and we are evaluating that carefully because it really has to all be in service of making ourselves more effective, more efficient and doing this with margin expansion which you are seeing continuing as we make these investments. Mike Mayo : Last follow-up. The decision between buyer build and you certainly are investing and that\u2019s why I was asking those questions, but what about the trade-off with buying and your answer to a Glenn\u2019s question earlier, I thought was very comprehensive and I can\u2019t wait to get the transcript to keep that. But when I look at your list, consumer lending, commercial lending, cash management, thousand more companies with Investment Banking, at what point would you ever consider merging with a traditional commercial bank? Marty Chavez : So, let me start up by talking at a related different buy versus build and then I\u2019ll get to the last part of your question. So, we had a long history at the firm and I was a part of that since I grew up in the engineering businesses as a quant and software person. We had a long tradition where we would say the only thing crazier than building all your own software is not building all of your own software. And so, we did that for a very long time and we\u2019ve built hundreds of millions of lines of custom software. Our own language, we wrote our own database. That was a part of that a long, long time ago. And that has served us very well. So that platform that we\u2019ve been working on, we just actually celebrated the 25th anniversary of it a couple weeks ago. The SecDB platform is now wall-to-wall across all of our businesses globally and voiced out there. One thing that we\u2019ve been working on is extending it out to the clients and packaging it up in APIs and user experiences and making it directly available to clients. Along the way, we\u2019ve evolved that strategy of building everything internally and the strategy has now become one which we describe as a waterfall and so the waterfall is download, builds, buy.  And so, there I would say, by download, we just mean, if it\u2019s open source so we can participate in open source. We start there. If that\u2019s not going to work for our growth plan, then we are going to think about building it. But if it\u2019s really not differentiated, if it already exists in a great form and you saw that was Clarity Money, then the example there will be to buy.  So, pretty different from the old approach. We look at all of these possibilities and are open minded there as you know pros and cons to all of that. I\u2019d expect that we are highly likely to continue with bolt-on acquisitions we\u2019ve found in our Marcus business, but in many other places, that\u2019s building it on our own allows us to deliver best-in-class experiences. But even within those context, as you are seeing with Clarity Money, we develop the view that that it already existed in a great form and so acquiring it makes sense. And so we are evaluating all of these acquisitions including things that you described, we are open minded and it\u2019s all part of the consideration as we execute on the strategy. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. How are you doing? Marty Chavez : Very well. Thanks. How are you? Betsy Graseck : Good. So I just wanted to drill in on a couple of things. One was on the growth and the impact on the buyback. So I understand the rational for turning up the buyback in second quarter. I am looking at the fact that your end of period assets grew about 6% Q-on-Q.  So, as I am modeling out what kind of growth rate you are likely to get in assets, is it like 1%, 2%, I can keep for $5 billion to $6 billion buyback, but if we are going to \u2013 if you are going to be able to continue to grow it like a 5%, 6% Q-on-Q, that\u2019s when the buyback gets shut off. Maybe you could help let me understand when to turn it on and off? Marty Chavez : So, we called out the passing of the buyback in the second quarter. It\u2019s part of the plan that we submitted to the Federal Reserve for their approval and we\u2019ll hear, we\u2019ll hear from them in June on that. And our goal is always to operate from a position of strength by exceeding all the regulatory capital requirements and having the resources available to meet the client demand for our balance sheet.  And as we do that, we are looking at serving the clients and doing so in a way that generates attractive risk returns for our shareholders and when we \u2013 the approach is straightforward. When we see opportunities to deploy capital in that way to serve the clients, then we are going to do that and we would always prefer that when we see the returns there as well to buying back our shares above book value. It\u2019s a high-class problem to have, this taking capital allocation and while it\u2019s important to have the excess capacity and that\u2019s why we highlighted that $5 billion to $6 billion expectation, if the demand from the clients continues to be strong, that is really the principal driver and when we see that demand and the opportunity to deploy capital with high ROEs that\u2019s what we are going to do. Betsy Graseck : I probably get it growing the book for our clients is best use of capital. I am just wondering if there was a breakpoint with the 6% versus the 1% to 2% that we have seen over the past several quarters that\u2019s all. Marty Chavez : Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t see it as a breakpoint. I would say, that\u2019s far from being a breakpoint and really it\u2019s dynamic as clients\u2019 demands for our balance sheet continues to be strong. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just second question on the markets and the deposit gathering that you are doing. I know you called it out in the prepared remarks, could you just give us a sense as to how much funding you are expecting? You are going to be able to support with the market\u2019s deposit growth? In other words, maybe you could give us a sense as to what kind of inflows you are anticipating getting with the price points that you have and how much loan growth do you think that can support over the next couple of quarters? Marty Chavez : On the loan growth, I gave you the figure which is that, as of the end of March, we are over $20 billion in retail deposits. That figure back at the acquisition was $9 billion and there was about a $3 billion increase in those retail deposits in the first quarter and there we continue to, of course, pay close attention to what the deposit rates available are and you can see from that evolution that we have rates that are in the sort of top bunch of the pack but not at the top.  And there is a philosophy is to continue to grow the deposits by offering a better product and a better service and we are certainly exploring all kinds of ways to grow that deposit base with different products and different geographies. And you can expect to see some of those play out in results in future quarters. Having said all that, our loan-to-deposit ratio is low. And so, we definitively have sufficient capacity to fund the loans our clients\u2019 demands for loans. Betsy Graseck : Great, great. And then just lastly, due to the marketing expenses associated with the deposit program, I mean, are those relatively small? I mean, it\u2019s not going to be something that shows that the non-comp expense that I should model in that roughly it\u2019s in the runrate today and that is just been a question that I\u2019ve gotten from some people, is the marketing going to show-up in any meaningful form? Marty Chavez : So, Betsy, the marketing expenses as we build out the consumer business do as you say, show up in non-comp. And we broke out some of the drivers in the year-on-year increase and outlined $100 million of that year-on-year increase is related not only to building out the Marcus platform, the market development of it, but also relating to investing in our investment entities that are consolidated on the balance sheet and therefore their expenses will also show up in non-comps.  On the Marcus business, as we mentioned in the last call, we\u2019ve integrated the deposit and lending activities under one brand and increasingly you are going to see all of the adjacencies in that one brand and brand consistency and user experience consistency across all of the offerings into the Marcus brand is an important priority.  So the market developments and expenses will all be well be integrated. The results that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter include all of the investment costs as we build out this business. That\u2019s all baked in and we are still a few years away from fully scaling that business. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks a lot. Appreciated. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking the question. Just, I\u2019d apologize if you\u2019ve touched on this, but could you talk about the trends we saw this quarter, there was a lot of volatility and significant change in how we started out the quarter, risk appetite, engagement, it seemed in the beginning, maybe first half of the quarter versus March.  Could you, did that have a noticeable impact on your revenue trends trading businesses? And how has the quarter \u2013 second quarter started? I know it\u2019s early days, but maybe any indication would be great. Thanks. Marty Chavez : Well, Brennan, as we all know, it\u2019s in the nature of markets to fluctuate. Wouldn\u2019t every week and every month is different, certainly in February, we saw the notable spike in vol and in volatility and volatility or mix wall, that was easy to see on all of the screens. In terms of volatility, in other asset classes, well, it\u2019s up a little bit from very low levels.  What I will note is that we are definitely seeing a trend where there is more dispersion in the asset classes than we\u2019ve seen before. So for instance, higher rates, but not generally playing through into a stronger dollar and increased activity and volatility in credit markets, not really necessarily showing up in a powerful or material way in the credit markets. And so, those \u2013 that kind of dispersion has continued, but I wouldn\u2019t say that there is anything material that I call out to read through into the first couple weeks of April. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. Marty Chavez : Good morning. Guy Moszkowski : With revenue as strong as it was in the first quarter across so many businesses and you did talk about positive operating leverage on the non-comp expense side, but I was wondering why you didn\u2019t signal that positive operating leverage as well on the comp accrual rate? Marty Chavez : The comp accrual rate is something that we evaluate under a large number of scenarios. For what the rest of the year could be, we also do a little bit of a backwards look as you would expect, but it\u2019s much more forward-looking.  And when we look at all of these different scenarios, 41% which is the same as where we had it in the first quarter of last year is our best estimate or where the comp ratio will be for the year, but of course as you know, extremely well that evolves as we work through the year. Guy Moszkowski : Got it. And then, just noticing that, when you talked about fixed income, you talked about strength in credit in the year-over-year comparison anyway that I thought was in contrast as pretty much all of your peers that have reported to-date. I was wondering, is that strength that you saw on the credit side, just a base effect that you didn\u2019t have such a good execution in this quarter a year ago. Or was it more than you were just extra conservatively hedged or just something else? Marty Chavez : It\u2019s the year-on-year driver in global credit was increased client activity. So, that\u2019s really the best way to see the improvements in the results. Part of it was the comparison as you mentioned. But really it\u2019s improved client activity and also I would call out within that in structure trading, particularly notable contributor to the year-on-year increase. Guy Moszkowski : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just one more quick one, which is also credit-related, but in a different way, in discussing Marcus, you did say that you were tracking your credit expectations. But I think that, a lot of the clients that I\u2019ve spoken with were a little surprised in your 10-K when you noted the higher than expected percentage of assets which are \u2013 or clients which are essentially sub-prime at least according to the FICO definition.  And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you are seeing in terms of delinquency, formation and alike in the Marcus portfolio? Marty Chavez : In the charge-offs and AHFL build of the portfolio, it\u2019s all proceeding according to expectations. I remember vividly that section in the K that you are talking about it to go back and look at it. And don\u2019t \u2013 and we could certainly get back to you on that whether there is migration from where somewhere the loans were originated.  But I\u2019ll ask Heather to get back to you on the detail of that. We give disclosures and indications of where we are, really what I would say is that, there has been no surprises in the evolution of that business at all and we are well aware of where we are in the credit cycle as we set those expectations and we monitor it closely.  I get reports every day and every week and we have a structure in that platform in that business where we can rapidly roll out revisions to the credit sandbox as conditions evolve. Guy Moszkowski : Okay, great. Thanks for answering my questions. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein : Yes, hi. Can you talk \u2013 you mentioned earlier competition, I think you said is continuing on the bid ask spread side and I am just wondering, there is a higher volatility which historically has correlated this higher bid ask spreads.  Do you still that correlation breaking down from what we used to pre-regulation I refer as you to the set platform on post-trade transparency? I.e., is there a change that higher volatility in any of you is not leading to the historic higher bid ask spread levels? And I base it a little bit on your comment, but if you can maybe elaborate. Marty Chavez : Well, first I will say, there are higher levels of volatility. You can see it in our VaR and yet the main driver of the increase in VaR was not increase in volatility. It was actually increasing in client demand for our balance sheet. And certainly in the case of Equities, there was that pronounced vol spike that happened in February.  When I look at the other volatility measures, yes, they are up for sure. But really it\u2019s, I would say a modest improvement in the market-making backdrop. It\u2019s evolving up in dramatic way, that would have shown, that would have played through as a driver of our VaR. There is a connection, no doubt, between vol and bid offer.  But it isn\u2019t linear and it doesn\u2019t happen in tight synchrony and there are also all kinds of evolutions in the market in the way products are traded in the packaging of the products themselves. And that\u2019s certainly an evolution as well. So, it would be too simple to say that there is just as tight co-efficient that relates VAR to bid ask. It\u2019s really the result of a lot of drivers playing through together. Kian Abouhossein : And then, in terms of the trends, when we look at FICC in the first quarter, we heard from some peers there has been a material drop-off and then the rates business in particular in March. And can you just \u2013 I assume, you are sort of seeing the same developments across the market and can you just comment why that is?  And it should lead you think about normal seasonality trends as we have seen in the past, the fixed income is just a straight declining line first and second quarter. Do you see that as a reasonable trend for the market? Marty Chavez : Well, I would start by saying that in the months-to-months comparisons, there is not a lot of information content to get into our FICC businesses. They are a little bit more detailed. There is a better market-making backdrop increase VAR, higher volumes across many of the asset classes and importantly, the work that we are doing to improve broaden, strengthen, diversify our engagement with clients, who are our clients, as well as new clients in different segments.  And most of the businesses rose year-on-year, foreign exchange, certainly and that was the driver of \u2013 and emerging markets, strong performance in emerging markets was the driver. In rates, if we look at the sequential change in the rates business, it\u2019s definitely up sequentially as you know and there it was really client activity-driven and clients responding to Central Bank activity. In the year-on-year comparison, rates declined a bit but remained solid. Kian Abouhossein : Thank you. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, James. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Hey, Marty. Maybe just a follow-up question on the Seb. Obviously, from the starting point to your stressed minimum, that\u2019s a bit of a challenge for you and your peers in the brokerage side. But, I think when you think about the stressed minimum, there is probably a pretty big assumption that\u2019s on the Fed on RWA inflation and we can\u2019t see that in the stress test because it just gives you a period end.  So is there any help you can give us on if they are assuming flat RWAs as they\u2019ve indicated or other sort of impacts that could help offset the big drop distressed minimum from start? Marty Chavez : Well, as you know, there is many changes in the CCAR framework that are outlined in the Fed\u2019s proposed rules from last week. And, certainly there is a lot of discussions with the Fed about the evolution of their scenarios over time. There is some important changes that they\u2019ve made, not only in putting a little more detail on Governor to rule those discussions back couple of years ago on stress capital buffer.  But they\u2019ve also been quite specific that they are changing their assumptions about capitalization or share repurchases and balance sheet growth as they are evolving the framework. And they have been \u2013 it\u2019s really clear in our discussions with the senior people at the Fed and the staff that they are open, they want to hear suggestions.  They actively want to make the framework more simple and more transparent. The transparency theme is one that they highlight at every opportunity. And so, there I will say that we\u2019ve been working on this evolving rule sets going back to 2009, the proposed rulemaking is consistent with everything that we\u2019ve been hearing from the Fed over a period of time.  No particular surprises and our model has been one where generally we have more sensitivity to some of the stress test than peers with a different mix and even in the phase of that over the cycle, we generally have ROEs at the top or near the top of the peer group. And so, the adjustments will continue. There will be new constraints. There will be evolutions.  There will be dynamic changes, hedges, various kinds that we can make in our business and we\u2019ll respond. And so, I would say, the work continues. Jim Mitchell : Absolutely. I am just wondering if there is a way you could help us frame the size of the impact of their assumed increase in RWAs that your stressed \u2013 at your peak to help us kind of at least get close to what might \u2013 at least one offset that you are starting where you can frame that? Marty Chavez : Yes. Actually, it\u2019s too early to tell that really we are seeing RWAs as flat in the stress scenario. And when we look at where our capital levels are, and what we think the notice of proposed rulemaking is likely to imply. We\u2019ve got a plan and we highlighted what we thought what we think.  The share repurchases will be over the CCAR cycle in the context of that plan and how we see that the minima evolving. So, it all ties together. I don\u2019t think at this current state with one week into the period of commenting on the notice of proposed rulemaking. I am thinking, there is a lot more that one could say right at this time. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. And just maybe a question on, there has been a lot of chatter on the overall being east, what\u2019s your sense of what that \u2013 how it\u2019s kind of impacted you and your peers in terms of constraining inventory? Do you think it\u2019s a big deal, little deal? How do you think, how do we think about the impact of potentially some little more leeway in terms of holding inventory? Is it a big positive, little positive? Marty Chavez : The discussions and indications from the regulators are that, they are looking to simplify the compliance with the Volcker Rule. Various \u2013 including very senior people at the Fed have said that it\u2019s a rule with a relatively straightforward concept or intent, but and its current form, the compliance with it. The number of data points that one has to generate is quite complicated.  And they\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s more complicated that it needs to be to serve the purpose of the rule. So, when we are thinking about how the Volcker Rule might change, we don\u2019t know. We will read the proposed rulemaking if there is one, when it comes out. And we will respond to it as we always do. Our thought would be it\u2019s likely to considerably simplify the process of conformance with the rule.  As for our ability to serve our clients make markets for them have the right amount of inventory on the balance sheet and manage all of those risks, it\u2019s dynamic. This is something that\u2019s one of our core strengths. Putting it all into the analytics and coming up with a strategy to optimize and draw all those constraints. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. Thanks. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Chris. Chris Kotowski : In your discussion of INO, you flagged $550 million of net interest income and believe the year ago number was 243 in the fourth quarter is right around 400. So, I am curious, does that reflect some unusually good positioning opportunities in the first quarter? Or does that primarily reflect the underlying growth in the loan portfolio, so that we could multiply it by four and add a growth factor? Marty Chavez : So, I am not sure if you call that the second quarter of last year or the fourth quarter of last year. My records in the fourth quarter NII was $500 million and now it\u2019s $554 million, just little north of $550 million and definitively, it is \u2013 think of it is recurring. It is related to expanding our lending activities and continuing to diversify the lending activities. That\u2019s $554 million component of the $1 billion in the debt INO segment, that $550 million component is recurring. As for the balance of it, happy to give you a little bit more color on the balance of the revenues, $1 billion, minus the $554 million and it\u2019s a diversified portfolio. We\u2019ve got a differentiated sourcing mechanism and in that business a very long history of strong risk adjusted returns.  And so the additional revenues beyond the recurring NII are mark-to-market gains, which were driven by underlying credit fundamentals, not just like credit spread widening that we saw in the quarter. Just underlying and fundamentals as well as specific events and there it would be important to note that it\u2019s diversified. It reflects mark-to-market, company-specific events, credit fundamentals across more than a 100 loans and securities. And there was no single name that was a significant contributor in any way to the results. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. So I was looking at note 25 in your Ks and Qs, but that\u2019s puts up net interest income and it doesn\u2019t quite match up to the numbers you gave. But I\u2019ll follow-up with Heather. Marty Chavez : Okay, we\u2019ll be happy to follow-up. There is net interest income in the segment and then there is net interest income for the firm and that\u2019s likely the difference between the two. But Heather will follow-up with you. Chris Kotowski : Yes, but I am right in thinking that there is \u2013 I guess, the thing that\u2019s interesting is always rapid growth off a small base. Marty Chavez : That\u2019s the theme we\u2019ve built in our lending books over the past several quarters from a very small base and that\u2019s the phenomenon that you are seeing is important to emphasize in that lending growth that is franchise adjacent lending growth. That\u2019s not lending in and of itself that\u2019s related to all of our other businesses. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Thank you. I\u2019ll follow-up. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Steven. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning, Marty. So, wanted to just start-off with a question on the balance sheet growth. I was hoping you can give us some better insight just in terms of the specific drivers of the balance sheet expansion. I recognize it was a reflection of a pickup in client activity in the quarter? I just want to get a better sense as to what \u2013 given the uptick in VaR, as well as the sheer magnitude of balance sheet growth, why we didn\u2019t see a bigger increase in RWA? Marty Chavez : So, the growth in the balance sheet generally, it\u2019s an increase in loans receivable and it\u2019s also in financial instruments owned to support Repo and our prime services business and so that\u2019s where you are seeing the balance sheet growth.  As for the risk-weighted assets, they were constantly working to optimize the risk-weighted assets, especially if you get into advanced risk-weighted assets, you are seeing some continuing roll-off in operational risk-weighted assets and then the results of a lot of work on efficiencies, of various kinds, netting opinions, compression and so on all playing through into reduction of the risk-weighted assets. There \u2013 it would be lovely if there was just a direct and easy connection between balance sheet and risk-weighted assets, but there is portfolio effects and it isn\u2019t just a direct linear relationship. Steven Chubak : I appreciate all the color there, Marty and I know it\u2019s a rather envelope question. So, appreciate the effort. I just have one follow-up on Marcus. I know you already gave a very comprehensive response to Glenn\u2019s earlier question discussing some of the various product launches. I am just wondering as I think back to last year, when you initially highlighted the $1 billion revenue target and how much of those new launches that will be spin, cited in the \u2013 and you highlight on the call or initially contemplated as part of that target, or is there maybe upside that could actually be realized as you maybe pursue other potential avenues or product channels? Marty Chavez : Steven, when we announced the growth initiatives, one thing that we said was really important to reiterate that is that, they were not intended to be the definitive all encompassing list of growth initiatives. They were a set of initiatives that we shared with the market to hold ourselves accountable and to drive and organize our activities.  But, again, not the comprehensive set and certainly when we first began the planning process that led to the launch of our Marcus business, we looked at well over a hundred opportunities in consumer finance. And there, we evaluated all of those opportunities through a set of different lenses. Did we see substantial pain points for clients and therefore the opportunity to deliver some value?  Did we see a way to leverage core strengths that we already have, but that\u2019s in engineering or risk management culture and processes? And did we see attractive shareholder returns? And as well, would it be possible to generate meaningful results for us without requiring a large market share in those businesses. And so, we still refer back to that set, because it\u2019s quite comprehensive and the world changes and evolves and so, we are looking at a very large number of opportunities. And we will execute on some of them and the ones we execute on will check all the boxes that I just outlined. And the set is quite large. So we are evaluating credit cards as you\u2019ve heard us say.  We are looking at wealth management. We are looking at retirement products. We are looking at personal finance and we are looking at the adjacencies in and among our various businesses as we build all these things out. And so, the short answer to your question is, the growth initiatives are the one we outlined and we are tracking them.  We are making progress on them. There is granular indicators that we look at every week and there is a lot of other activities that are also happening, that we haven\u2019t expressly highlighted for you in the form of the growth initiatives. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great, Marty. I appreciate the color. Thank you for taking my questions. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Devin. Devin Ryan : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Marty. Most of my questions have been asked here. And I just have a modeling question. So the $50 million this quarter relate to the revenue recognition accounting change, should think that\u2019s maybe a low number moving forward, just assuming revenues in areas like M&A advisory, move higher?  And then, just trying to connect that to any implications that could have on the comp ratios this year, obviously, which is going to be one more lever in addition to kind of the higher starting point on revenues in the first quarter to maybe help push that comp ratio lower. So we didn\u2019t see it in the accrual this quarter.  Just trying to kind of think about some of the moving parts here. I know, you are kind of taking a full year view and you\u2019ll maybe adjust it later depending on the backdrop. But I am just trying to get a sense if this is conservatism as we are all in the year and that maybe one more factor to kind of think about what should be also kind of be thinking about the growth investments as we are just thinking about all those moving parts here? Marty Chavez : So, in that $50 million component of the $300 million year-on-year increase in non-comps, the $50 million that\u2019s related to the change in accounting standards. I would say there is just some very modest conservatism in there and I would call it $230 million effect once you analyze it. And so, of course, we take it into account in all the scenarios that I mentioned, when we set our estimate at 41% for the comp ratio, that\u2019s in there.  Ultimately, as we go through the year and the results become clear, and we look at non-compensation, compensation and operating expenses, both of them together as operating expenses, a super important consideration for us always is delivering operating leverage with revenues growing meaningfully more than expenses and therefore that\u2019s playing through to the bottom-line increasing even more than revenues.  That\u2019s all part of the mix of how we set the comp ratio. 41% is our best estimate. It includes all of these factors that we\u2019ve outlined, but ultimately, it\u2019s an output, not an input. Devin Ryan : Okay, got it. Fair enough. And then, maybe just, not to beat the dead horse here, but on Marcus appreciate, all the detail and kind of the tangent areas that are growing in terms of loan opportunities. But when we think about the $1 billion of \u2013 it sounds like loan growth within Marcus alone this quarter.  Is they are adding some of these additional capabilities, it would seem that that should accelerate here, because I know that there is $12 billion of balance sheet tied to Marcus in the growth plan. So I am assuming that potentially there is an opportunity to actually increase that, given they are already at $1 billion today. Is that reasonable? Marty Chavez : Let\u2019s go back to one point. I think it could $1 billion loan growth in Marcus have actually in the quarter, it\u2019s $0.5 billion. Devin Ryan : Okay, got it. Yes, I think you were at a little bit over $2 billion last quarter, so. Okay, missed it. Marty Chavez : I am sorry. Could you then repeat the rest of your question please? Devin Ryan : Yes, I guess, my \u2013 the premise of the question was that if you are in the ballpark of $1 billion already and we are still in early days, is there an opportunity to potentially accelerate off of that, so that would maybe put the $12 billion level within the growth target is maybe a bit low at this point? Marty Chavez : So, in the Marcus business, as it\u2019s a new business for us, we are not in any hurry. We are not approving large numbers of applications. We could approve more, but we are choosing not to, because it\u2019s all part of this deliberate organic growth process. We are always thinking of where we are, maybe more accurately said where we might be in the credit cycle since there will be no announcements of the turn of the credit cycle or any harbingers of when it\u2019s going to turn.  Hence taking all those into account, we are going to proceed with this methodical growth always open to revisiting it, but right now, as we look at the $12 billion balance sheet on Marcus and we look at the revenue opportunity associated with our Marcus, which, just as a reminder is the entire Marcus business not just lending, but also deposits. That remains our growth target. Devin Ryan : Yes, great. Thanks, Marty. Very helpful. Marty Chavez : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : How are you, Marty? A question for you. On the mark-to-market accounting that we show this quarter in the equity portfolios, can you share with us was there a cumulative mark because of the change in accounting and will we see similar \u2013 I mean, based on volatility every quarter of course, is that a kind of normal mark or was there something that was built up from prior quarters that had to be recognized and the marks will actually be lower going forward? Marty Chavez : I know, some of the peer groups mentioned one-off effects from accounting changes. That is definitely not the case for us. Everything in that portfolio is and has been fair valued. So there was no kind of accumulation. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then, second, when you guys talked about your Equities trading business, Equities Client Execution was quite strong as you've indicated and I think you highlighted that the cash and derivatives area was particularly good.  Can you give us some color what was it within those categories that really drove it and then was it more long-only traditional accounts versus trading accounts? And then, geographically, was there any area where America is stronger than EMEA or Asia and so on? Marty Chavez : Well, first to step back and the important context is that, the year-on-year growth in Equities Client Execution is driven by client activity. And I would \u2013 if it were possible to call out a specific area of outperformance, I\u2019d currently would do that, but actually I\u2019d prefer it like it is, which is that it\u2019s quite balanced across cash and derivatives and flow and structured and all the regions including prime.  It\u2019s across the client segments of asset managers and corporations. The traditional clients, and newer clients, it was absolutely everything all of the parts of the business working together and really a good evidence that all of these businesses in this kind of environment all work together synergistically. So, it was across the board. Gerard Cassidy : And being in across the board, would you say that \u2013 or I don't know if you could break it out this way, what percentage of it was really market-driven meaning that volatility you identified particularly in February versus your guys' efforts of working twice as hard to get more engagement? Can you break it out that way or is that not really that easy to do? Marty Chavez : I wouldn\u2019t break it out that way. I would go back to something that I touched on earlier, which is that even without the vol spike, it still would have been a strong quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Marty Chavez : Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Marty Chavez : Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will walk you through our second quarter and first half results and then cover each of our businesses and of course I am happy to answer any questions. Second quarter net revenues were $9.4 billion. Net earnings were $2.6 billion. Earnings per share were $5.98. Return on common equity was 12.8% and return on tangible common equity was 13.5%. Turning to year-to-date results, we had firm-wide net revenues of $19.4 billion, net earnings of $5.4 billion earnings per diluted share of $12.93. We grew first half revenues by 22% or $3.5 billion versus the first half of 2017, while pre-tax earnings were up 33%. Year-to-date return on common equity was 14.1% and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%. Stronger revenues across our businesses and positive operating leverage drove first half ROTE of roughly 15%, our best first half performance in 9 years. We achieved those results and at the same time made meaningful investments to support future growth. Our first half revenue growth resulted from broad-based momentum across the firms as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace versus the first half of 2017. Institutional client services increased 24%, reflecting a 32% rebound in FICC, where we continue to grow our client franchise and strengthened our market-making capabilities. During second quarter, we saw solid client engagement across our businesses with positive macro trends supporting corporate and investor activity, with the backdrop of rising U.S. rates and better visibility on QE in Europe, trends emerged across a variety of markets and asset classes. This quarter, our clients responded to a stronger U.S. dollar, weaker EM currencies, higher oil prices and a divergence between U.S. investment grade and high-yield spreads. Despite the persistence of geopolitical and economic risks, the backdrop remains constructive as our clients continue to seek our advice and market-making services. While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic that many of the broader drivers underpinning the solid start to the year, healthy economic growth, positive investor sentiment and the emergence of new market trends can remain in place. Let\u2019s review individual business performance for the second quarter. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, 14% higher than the first quarter driven by robust growth in advisory and continued strong and stable performance in underwriting. Financial advisory revenues were $804 million, up 37% relative to the first quarter reflecting higher completed M&A volumes. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions totaling $477 billion across 125 deals, our highest quarterly deal count in over a decade. Announced volumes remained strong globally. Client engagement increased notably across the Americas and Europe. Year-to-date, healthy activity across a broad base of sectors, including tech media telecom, natural resources and healthcare all strengthened our pipeline. For the year-to-date, we ranked first in announced M&A volumes. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Results were our third highest on record and up 3% versus the first quarter as strength in equity offerings offset lower debt underwriting. Equity underwriting net revenues of $489 million increased 19% to the highest level in 3 years as our volume growth outpaced the industry. For the year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity and equity related underwriting, with over $40 billion of deal volume across more than 200 transactions. A healthy mix of activity supported our equity underwriting volumes during the second quarter. Our IPO volumes increased by over 50% versus the year ago period and our follow-on and convertible volumes grew double-digits despite an overall decline in industry volumes. Strength across all regions drove performance, including notable deals in Asia, such as Xiaomi\u2019s $4.7 billion IPO which was the largest technology since 2014. Debt underwriting net revenues were robust $752 million, down 6% from last quarter. First half performance was a record reflecting our strong client engagement and multiyear investment in the business. Debt underwriting performance this quarter included significant contributions from acquisition-related activity. Year-to-date, we ranked number one in institutional leveraged loans globally and top 3 in high yield. Our Investment Banking backlog increased significantly versus the first quarter to reach a record level driven by M&A and underwriting. Clarity from U.S. tax reforms, a supportive economic backdrop, generally resilient equity valuations, accessible financing and the virtuous cycle of M&A in certain sectors are all supporting activity. Moving to Institutional Client Services, net revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter, down 19% compared to the first quarter, but up 17% versus the second quarter last year. While performance declined from a solid first quarter, client engagement remained healthy and the overall backdrop remained constructive for our market-making franchises. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the second quarter, down 19% versus the first quarter, 45% higher than the second quarter of 2017. Our improvement reflected higher client activity and our efforts to both deepen and broaden our client relationships. The operating environment was more constructive and we faced your inventory headwinds than the second quarter of last year. This quarter, we had lower sequential performance across many of our businesses. Nevertheless, client flows were healthy and this is particularly notable in our macro businesses, where diverging economic outlooks drove major government bond markets. Within FICC, currencies declined significantly versus the first quarter as weaker performance in emerging markets more than offset better performance in G-10. Commodities decreased significantly versus the first quarter reflecting lower performance in natural gas. Commodities however increased significantly versus the second quarter of 2017, which included inventory challenges. Credit also declined versus the solid first quarter amid wider spreads, particularly in Europe partially offset by stronger performance in structured credit. Rates was modestly lower sequentially as lower revenues in Europe were partially offset by solid performance in the U.S. as clients responded to central bank activity. Mortgages, was relatively flat sequentially. Turning to Equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 18% versus the strong first quarter as equity market volumes and volatility declined. Equities Client Execution net revenues of $691 million declined from the first quarter, which was our highest quarterly performance in 3 years. Our derivatives business declined significantly in the second quarter driven by reduced volatility and the more limited opportunity set. Over the past 3 years, we have had a balanced franchise with derivatives and cash each contributing roughly half of Equities Client Execution revenues. Commissions and fees net revenues of $763 million declined 7% on modestly lower market volumes across regions. We continue to pursue opportunities for market share consolidation, particularly in low touch execution, where we gained volume market share this quarter in every region. Security Services net revenues of $437 million were essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.3 billion reflecting net gains from private equities driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. Approximately, 60% of our revenues were from events such as sales in our private portfolio and mark-to-market on public securities. During the quarter, notable sales included contract food manufacturer, Hearthside Food and capital markets data provider, Ipreo. On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $2.4 billion of net revenues, roughly 65% from corporate investments and 35% from real estate. Our global private and public equity portfolio remains well diversified with over 1,000 different investments. Our performance continues to be driven by an investment discipline that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns. We achieved this by applying extensive operational expertise and working closely with portfolio companies to grow their businesses. The portfolio remains diversified across the industry, geography and balanced across investment vintage. By vintage, we made 42% of the investments in the equity portfolio in the last 3.5 years, only 7% between 2012 to 2014 and the remaining 31% in 2011 or earlier. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $663 million. Results included over $625 million of net interest income equivalent to $2.5 billion annual pace. Our net interest income continues to grow as we increased more recurring revenue streams and lends more to our broad client base. Results also included provision for loan losses of $234 million. Our I&L assets included approximately $106 billion in loans, debt securities and other assets and $22 billion in equity investments. Let me spend a moment and give you an update on Marcus. Today, we have three products in the U.S. markets, consumer personal loans, savings and our recently acquired personal financial management app, Clarity Money. We will launch our fourth product entering the UK deposit market later this year. We have originated over $4 billion of consumer loans since launch and we held $3.1 billion of loans on our balance sheet as of June 30. In addition, our retail deposits grew to over $23 billion as we continue to expand and diversify our funding. Across our businesses, Marcus now serves more than 1.5 million customers. We continued to be prudent in our underwriting and pricing of risk in our consumer lending business to ensure attractive risk adjusted returns. We only lend to creditworthy customers with a demonstrated ability to pay. We employ a conservative underwriting process using multiple hard cuts to define the narrow credit sandbox in which we operate. In addition to FICO, we use proprietary scoring models which have been carefully vetted by our central risk management process. While the overall markets portfolio remains small relative to the size of the firm\u2019s balance sheet, we approach our credit risk management responsibility seriously and systematically. The loans portfolio however will naturally season over time and fee credit migration over the cycle. And our recent experience a vast majority of the portfolio has remained in the same FICO band or even improves. As of June 30, loans with refreshed FICO scores below 660 measured in the low double-digit as a percent of the portfolio. This reflects migration and our deliberate testing in the 632 to 660 range which represents less than 5% of originations. Importantly, the average FICO score of our portfolio continues to exceed 700 and our loss expectations remain approximately 4% to 5% on an annual basis. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity to build a significant accretive and value added consumer franchise. We continued to evaluate new product opportunities including wealth management, credit cards and others with our criteria to launch predicated on our ability to address consumer needs apply the core competencies of Goldman Sachs and deliver attractive returns to shareholders. Moving to Investment Management, we produced record net revenues in the second quarter driven by strong incentive fee realizations and solid contributions from both our asset management and PWM businesses. Net revenues were $1.8 billion, up 4% sequentially including stable management and other fees of $1.3 billion and significantly higher incentive fees triggered by harvesting including one of our secondary vintage funds. Transaction revenues of $182 million declined 14% driven primarily by lower PWM client activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.5 trillion, up $15 billion versus the first quarter driven by $8 billion of long-term net inflows, spread across our asset classes, $10 billion of liquidity product net inflows, offset by $3 billion of market depreciation. Now let me turn to expenses, we continued to monitor and manage our overall expense base with an emphasis on paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and spending to support our clients while investing in technology and infrastructure to grow the firm for the future. Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits. We reduced our year-to-date compensation to net revenues ratio to 39%, down 200 basis points from the first half of last year, reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability. Non-compensation expenses were $2.7 billion, up 6% versus the first quarter and up 24% versus a year ago. Roughly half of the increase versus last year was good expense growth including approximately $175 million from investments to drive growth including markets and our consolidated investments and to build scale through technology. Another roughly $75 million comes from client activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. The remainder includes approximately $125 million related to higher litigation and $80 million related to the new accounting standard. As we look ahead, we currently expect non-compensation expenses for the second half of the year to be materially consistent with the first half. As we continue to build scale in platform businesses, there is a natural migration from compensation to non-compensation expenses over time. To ensure a disciplined approach, we monitor our cost holistically through measures such as efficiency or overhead ratios and we are pleased to see these measures improve in the first half of 2018 versus first half 2017. On taxes, our reported year-to-date tax rate was approximately 19%. We expect our full year 2018 tax rate to be approximately 20%. This rate can vary and is based on a number of factors, including our overall level and mix of earnings and updated guidance from treasury on the implementation of tax legislation. We will provide updates on our future tax rate once we have final guidance from treasury. Turning to balance sheet liquidity and capital, our global core liquid assets averaged $237 billion during the quarter, which we expect to decline as we redeploy our balance sheet to meet client needs. Our balance sheet was $969 billion roughly flat versus last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.6% using the standardized approach and 11.5% under the Basel 3 advanced approach. Our ratios improved by 50 basis points and 40 basis points respectively on a sequential basis driven primarily by increases in common equity. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.8%, up 10 basis points versus the first quarter. On capital return, we paid $314 million in common stock dividends, which included a 7% increase this quarter to $0.80 per share. Last month, the Federal Reserve announced it did not object to our $6.3 billion capital return plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle, including $5 billion of share repurchases and $1.3 billion of dividends. The level of our share repurchase plan reflects our capital position post-tax reform and our desire to invest in the growth of our client franchise. The $5 billion repurchase plan remains within the range of expectations we laid out in April and we will resume buybacks this quarter. On the stress capital buffer, it\u2019s important to recognize that for several years we have managed the firm\u2019s capital to a stressed concept. The Federal Reserve\u2019s SCB proposal is a formalization of this process, while the natural tendency is to extrapolate recent CCAR results to estimate stress capital requirements, which would imply a roughly 6 percentage points stress capital buffer we caution against reading too much into a single data point. Over the past 3 and 5 years, our peak to trough CET1 ratio change averaged roughly 5 percentage points. We do not yet know precisely how this new capital requirement will be calculated. We submitted a comment letter to the Federal Reserve and like many other rule changes once we know the final requirements we will comply and adapt accordingly. Before taking questions a few closing thoughts, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2018, including our execution on our $5 billion revenue growth initiatives. So, these initiatives are not the limit of our ambition. Across each of our 7 revenue initiatives, we are running ahead of plan and continue to make progress in each of our businesses. For example, in investment banking, we are hiring new bankers and expanding and enhancing our client coverage. To-date, we have completed more than 10 notable transactions from these efforts and continue to grow the backlog for the targeted clients. We have also seen success year-to-date with corporate clients supported by our expanded fixed and investment banking joint ventures. In ICS, we continue to gather feedback on our performance directly from our clients and from third-parties, where indications continue to be positive and our client volume market shares have improved. In equities, we generated over 100 basis points of market share expansion, with low touch clients globally versus 2016. In investment management, we are enhancing our client service offering growing advisory mandates and driving inflows in long-term fee-based assets. And finally, we are making solid progress across a variety of lending initiatives, including expanding our customer base of Marcus borrowers and depositors, growing our lending to PWM clients, and continuing to prudently deploy capital to our institutional lending and financing business. Clients remain the center of everything we do. We are investing in our global client franchise from a position of strength and will continue to make long-term investments to diversify our client footprint and expand the breadth of products and services we offer. By successfully implementing these initiatives, we expect to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth and enhance the durability of the firm\u2019s earnings profile. In conclusion, when we think about our ability to drive value, we are encouraged by roughly 15% returns year-to-date and to further benefit from our growth plans giving us increased confidence in our ability to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders. With that, thanks again for dialing in and we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Question on the I&L front I know it was a great private equity quarter, but a lot of growth is still being fueled on the I&L side, you pointed out the, call it, $2.5 billion of run-rate NII. You have been good enough to give us the 400, 450 like what is like setting stone based on the current portfolio. I don\u2019t want to read too much into it, so I want to ask specifically, is the $2.5 billion a new higher level, because you keep building the lending book. I just want to make sure that I am getting that right? Marty Chavez : Yes, Glenn, that\u2019s right. The $625 million of net NII in the quarter reflects $2.5 billion dollar run-rate and that is an outgrowth of growing the lending look. Glenn Schorr : Okay, great. To add on to that question is just I think you have been there for a long time and you are increasing efforts, but it feels early days in the growth of private credit in general and does it feel like the opportunities are accelerating there and are you constrained at all by your structure meaning in the old days you might raise a big fund like some of the old [indiscernible] but Volcker limits your participation like you just put on balance sheet is the same capital treatment, I am just curious if you could talk towards that? Marty Chavez : So, Glenn, in our business, we have, well, a variety of ways of looking at it in our merchant bank, we raised funds of course and then we also have the Special Situations Group. The best way to think about it is its franchise adjacent. What drives it is not market beta, but rather the adjacency to our IBD platform. That\u2019s how the sourcing of the investments works, that\u2019s how the harvesting works and this is an area where we are deploying capital. We are seeing attractive risk returns and we are seeing the private credit is reemerging. We have launched new funds. It\u2019s Volcker compliant. We partner with our clients in a variety of ways to participate in the lending and then our IBD platform can participate in the harvesting as well. So, this is the core competency for the firms. We have been doing it for decades. And it\u2019s an important pillar of our growth. Glenn Schorr : Okay, last quickie. I don\u2019t remember if and when there was ever a lower second quarter comp ratio, is that just a function of revenues up 22% for the year better clarity on it being at least to the 37%, is there anything to read into on if revenues continue at this pace we could actually see a lower comp ratio? Thanks. Marty Chavez : So, Glenn there, it is just as you say it, it\u2019s a strong revenue growth year-on-year and our emphasis on profitability. The compensation philosophy remains the same as it always has been, we pay it for performance and we attract and retain talent. Glenn Schorr : Alright, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. I appreciate it. Marty Chavez : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Thanks Marty. Maybe first question, just on the backdrop you mentioned pipeline at an all time high and you have got the tax reform, but then you get the trade stuff and so I just wanted to get some color on what you are seeing from clients both on the banking and the training front? Marty Chavez : So, I will start with the banking front and you know as we mentioned the backlog is strong at record level and the M&A backlog within that also at a record level, underwriting strong pipeline as well and the industry trends are robust. Yes, there is geopolitical and other discussions, but we are seeing the client engagement at high levels across the Americas, across Europe, it\u2019s broad, I highlighted a few of the sectors, but it\u2019s really across many sectors not just the ones I mentioned, PMT, natural resources and healthcare. And CEO confidence is strong, the firms have cash. It\u2019s driven by a lot of things, lower taxes and also the repatriations. So, the trade factor is there, but we have seen no impact on client\u2019s activity and it\u2019s clear to us and to our corporate clients that those strategic benefits outweigh the potential to receive challenges. Michael Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just want to get your perspective, like this is the second quarter where revenue growth has been strong, you guys produced operating leverage, ROE is year-to-date 14, TE is 15%, but valuation, it doesn\u2019t seem like you get much credit, is there \u2013 is it more just consistency over time, do you think they will follow through and the growth in book value will eventually deliver or from a disclosure standpoint and maybe some of the newer businesses whether it\u2019s on the lending side, is there more that maybe could be down or that you guys are looking into to maybe improve disclosure and transparency? Marty Chavez : Well, certainly Michael, we are leading in running the business for the long-term and we know that that the importance obviously of delivering revenue and earnings growth, hence the growth strategy that we outlined for the market is driving more recurring fee based revenue banding products and services and broadening the client base and that\u2019s something that you can see in our results and it\u2019s something that we are going to continue to work on. And our view is that as we do this the market will over time recognize that. For me, for Heather, for all of us at the firm, disclosure is a huge priority and we are open to any and all suggestions and recommendations from you, the analysts, from our investors and we are taking them on board and you can see some of that in my prepared remarks and as we go through the Q&A you will see more of it. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot Marty. Marty Chavez : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello Christian. Christian Bolu : Hello, good morning Marty. So just to have follow-up on operating leverage, it was pretty impressive in the first half as you said revenue growth of 22% in pre-tax even high at 33%, while all investing for growth, question is how should we think about operating leverage for the full year, I guess the comp ratio was down 200 bps for the quarter, is that a good way to think about the full year or should we be thinking about more in efficiency ratio, just we would like to get more color from you? Marty Chavez : The comp to net revenue ratio, and as you know, Christian, is 39% is our best estimate at this point for the full year. Operating leverage is a lens through which we examine many of our decisions. We know it\u2019s important to our stakeholders, it\u2019s important to us and as we make our investments, we keep those, we keep that in mind. And when we set the compensation ratio, we are looking at a variety of scenarios, but we are especially looking at our 3-year growth plan and those are all the factors that go into it. If you are going to see from us, we will remain focused on operating leverage in the back half of the year, the revenue environment is certainly a factor, but it also just like to emphasize that the comps in that revenue ratio, our best estimate for the year is an output of all of these other considerations. The main drivers are revenues and the growth plan and our emphasis on earnings and revenue growth. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. Maybe a bigger picture question on Marcus and the competitive landscape there, I think your vision is really to build out a comprehensive digital consumer platform, it sounds like other folks are thinking the same thing, JPMorgan launched its FIN digital initiative, Citi is talking about expanding and enhancing its footprint, even PNC is talking about its international bank. So, in light of that sort of that evolving competitive landscape kind of what\u2019s Goldman\u2019s edge in building out Marcus here? Marty Chavez : Well, Christian, as we outlined and this is the way we are making all of our decisions as we build out this business indeed as we launched ourselves into this business in the first place with the insertion point that you know, which is the installment loans that offers the deposit offering, we are always looking at it from a few perspectives. First, is this a large addressable market? Are there significant pain points that we can solve for our new clients, does it play to our strengths and something that we have been doing for decades that the firm is prudently managing risk in deploying capital and also building software? And is it an opportunity where we can have results that are material for us without requiring a large market share and other attractive risk returns for our shareholders? So as we developed this vision, you are seeing more of the offerings and it\u2019s coming into focus? And the emphasis for us is on what is the consumer\u2019s pain point and how can we solve it in a differentiated way given also that we don\u2019t have the legacy of scale mainframe systems and we don\u2019t have the bricks and mortars. And so as we are doing this and this was of course one of the things that attracted us to Clarity Money, it\u2019s the AB testing, it\u2019s the emphasis on making it an easy user experience leading with the behavioral economics, a better service. We know this is a competitive and commoditized business and we know that we have to differentiate ourselves and earn our way into it. That\u2019s what we are doing. Christian Bolu : Awesome. Thank you very much, Marty. Marty Chavez : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. My question relates to why isn\u2019t Lloyd Blankfein staying to the end of the year and what changes do you expect with David Solomon taking over the helmet, Lloyd or David saw in this call if they could answer that would be great? Marty Chavez : Well, Mike, you just got me for the call this morning and but I am happy to answer it, because this one is straightforward. What you saw in today\u2019s announcement was another step in the unfolding of the board\u2019s plan, which has been in place actually looking back for a real long time. Now you have seen various moments in the succession plans and today is one of those moments. The board has made its choice and its selection fair and that\u2019s been developing over the last \u2013 over the last several months, obvious, but important to say Lloyd and David and all of us have worked together over years and decades on our management committee. The average tenure is something like 20 some years. And so this is all part of the plan is for strategy, David and Lloyd and I and many of us have been working on our strategy and you have seen that develop over time you have seen it in conferences, there is going to be more discussions at upcoming conferences. You will hear the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you have seen that in the results, the emphasis on the growth plan on driving revenue and earnings growth. All of these are parts of the strategy and David has been instrumental in that strategy, I don\u2019t have any evolutions beyond that to announce right now, so stay tuned. Mike Mayo : Alright. Well, if I can follow-up, just in terms of the backlog being up, what\u2019s the percentage change, because you are saying it\u2019s a record backlog first quarter to second quarter, how much is that up? Marty Chavez : So, I am not going to breakout the percentage change other than to say that it was strong growth on the quarter with significance on the quarter and not only as I mentioned was it a record for the overall banking segment in backlog, it\u2019s a record M&A or financial advisory backlog and underwriting is at the second highest level ever. And then if you look within underwriting separately, debt underwriting and equity underwriting, those are each at the second highest level ever. Mike Mayo : So, last follow-up, so is this a sign that the economy is finally turning up a notch? We had the tax cut, we had some excitement about reflation we are waiting for this to kick in more forcefully. So now you have record backlogs that you just described, is that a function of that or is that just unique to Goldman Sachs sometimes these revenues are lumpy? Marty Chavez : Well, we are certainly seeing all kinds of trends at play and you mentioned some of them, we have seen resilient growth across many economies, rising U.S. rates, do the unwinds, tax reform behind us and therefore a lot more clarity on its stronger U.S. labor market, CEO confidence, GDP growth, all of those things are part of the macro backdrop and the momentum feels good. That combined with this franchise, that\u2019s by many most metrics number one quarter-to-quarter, year-after-year over the long haul, the combination of those two is powerful. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Harte : Good morning. So, a couple from me. One, looking back at the last quarter, one of the things I liked at least about the quarter was the spike in the balance sheet, we didn\u2019t really see a follow-through into this quarter, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing as far as client demand for your balance sheet and kind of what\u2019s your outlook is there? Marty Chavez : So, Jeff, we talked about this a fair bit. We like to say we are in the moving rather than the storage business and that\u2019s really something that you are seeing in the quarter. So balance sheet, as you noted as I mentioned was flat down $5 billion on the quarter. Within that, the movement in the balance sheet remains high and that gives the opportunity to allocate the balance sheet on a daily basis and to prioritize the way that we are dedicating financial resources and resources of various kinds to our clients that it\u2019s really a velocity story. Jeff Harte : Okay. You mentioned the tax rate, I believe you said 20% for 2018, which you had expected, hadn\u2019t you been before been talking about 23% or 24% kind of longer term is, is that a 2018 specific decline or should we be thinking about the longer term tax rate being lower as well? Marty Chavez : Yes, it is a 2018 story and that\u2019s our estimate for the full year. As you know when they are discrete items, equity-based compensation, for instance, we recognized those in the quarter, where they happen. Certainly, in terms of this year\u2019s tax rate, as we know, it\u2019s a transitional year for parts of the tax reform specifically the guilty and the beat taxes. As for 2019, the 24% rate that I highlighted before that\u2019s our best \u2013 that\u2019s what I would suggest you as the sensible model and assumption. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning, how are you doing? Marty Chavez : Great. Thank you. Betsy Graseck : Good. I have one follow-up question and then one other question, on the follow-up I know we talked already about the comp ratio and I know in your commentary you indicated, look that\u2019s going to be a function of revenues, but also profitability, so my question is around profitability, are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really don\u2019t want to go below 12% ROE, because we kept the 41, it would have been below that? Marty Chavez : We were not setting the comp ratio in that way at all Betsy, I mean of course we are looking at all kinds of things. As I mentioned, the philosophy of comps hasn\u2019t changed at all, but the framework hasn\u2019t changed either. The \u2013 I am well aware that we don\u2019t typically reduce the comp rates in the second quarter and though it has happened in the past really the framework is the same we are looking at where the revenues are and paying for performance. We don\u2019t have ROE targets. One thing that I would say that is an evolution and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks is that as we build and scale our businesses and apply more automation everywhere, it\u2019s natural to think about comp and non-comp holistically. And that\u2019s of course the efficiency ratio is one way to do it, pretax margin does it too and that is increasingly an emphasis for us on driving the efficiency ratio lower. And that\u2019s how we got that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So you have mentioned the profitability as one of the factors for assessing that, are we thinking about ROE or is there a different profitability measure you are thinking about? Marty Chavez : One of the fascinating things about our businesses where we are thinking about so many things, it\u2019s this combinatoric optimization across all kinds of metrics and constraints. We certainly do spend a lot of time thinking about our pretax as well as our pretax margin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hey good morning, Marty. So I was just Googling combinatoric to try to figure out. Quick one on Marcus, thanks for the increased disclosure especially on the refreshed FICO, that\u2019s helpful, I know it\u2019s a new business for you guys, but I definitely appreciate the attempts to improve and enhance the disclosures there. You mentioned the 4% to 5% annual loss rate on Marcus, is that still the through the cycle view or \u2013 number one and then are you provisioned at a level that\u2019s greater than that currently given that we are in the later innings of the cycle and can you can you give us some perspectives on that? Marty Chavez : Well, yes Brennan as I am happy to note that you saw the increased disclosure, I am working on it. The 4% to 5% is our best estimate and we are absolutely provisioned higher than that. Brennan Hawken : Cool. Thank you. And then another one is the narratives and chatter we are hearing on cash management and how you guys are considering a shift towards cash management, actually I think Marty you have referenced that in prior calls, could you \u2013 how should we think about how you are considering positioning yourselves in the marketplace there, what do you think would differentiate Goldman\u2019s offering versus competitors, why do you \u2013 what do you think the value proposition of Goldman is in blues in that business, because it\u2019s rather different than what we are used to thinking of as far as Goldman and the position in the marketplace? Marty Chavez : Sure. So as you know and as we have discussed and you have seen this we have started by making a partner level hire of an engineer for this business. And I think that tells you a lot right there about how we are approaching it. One of the interesting things about technology and software generally is that there is paradigm shifts that happens about every 20 years and that\u2019s actually pretty stable cycle. And if you look at the cash management offerings that are out there, what\u2019s immediately obvious is they really haven\u2019t changed much for two whole 20-year cycles. So, they are not too different than they were in the \u201870s and so that\u2019s an opportunity right there. But especially, as we evaluated this business, the adjacencies to our core franchise are striking and obvious. We have corporate relationships that are the best on the street and we have been working to broaden those corporate relationships through the companies who are our clients, well beyond the CEO and CFO to treasurers, assistant treasurers, procurement and so we have been building that connectivity and then also the adjacency to our foreign exchange business is obvious. And so there is some analogies to the Marcus. The same evaluation criteria we laid out that led us to Marcus are leading us to this business exactly. There is a sizable revenue pool, where having our small share of that revenue pool is going to be meaningful for us and it\u2019s an exciting opportunity, given changes in technology, payment rails and so many things. That\u2019s the opportunity and we are seeing it as a 2 to 3-year build. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Guy. Guy Moszkowski : Thanks. Good morning. Before I ask a question, I just \u2013 I know he is not on the call, but I just thought in case he listens to it later or something, I think really we all owe a hat tip to Lloyd for his leadership over these 12 years through good times and bad. And some things that were very idiosyncratic to Goldman Sachs, which he managed through I think super effectively with the team, so just a hat tip to him. Beyond that, I also want to say thanks for the Marcus data, which I thought was interesting and also a little bit of color you gave on some of the other initiatives that were laid out back in September of last year. We are coming up on the 1 year anniversary of when you laid those out in some detail and I was wondering when might we expect a more fulsome discussion of kind of where you are in terms of meeting some of those objectives? Marty Chavez : Well, sure. First, let me start with your hat tip to Lloyd. We feel the same way. That\u2019s a delightful, lovely thing you said and also immensely well-deserved. So I will be sure to pass it on to Lloyd, who has been an amazing leader and he has made all of us better. So on to your next question on the growth initiatives, yes, I will step back for a minute. So the way we are looking at the growth initiatives is there are 7 revenue lines in the growth initiatives and we are making solid progress on all of them at or ahead in some cases, well ahead of our targets. And beneath that there is 40 plus key performance indicators and we see those as precursors, harbingers of the revenue and important to track as well, which we do on a granular and as you would expect from us highly automated basis. I, we, many of us, David, all of us look at it weekly to see how we are going. I laid out some of them for you. So, for instance, on the expanding client coverage in both FICC and equities, you will remember that that\u2019s a $600 plus million annual revenue target in 3 years\u2019 time, for FICC, expanding across clients, especially the asset managers. And we are definitively seeing in broker votes and third-party surveys and all kinds of measures of wallet share that we are making solid progress there. Equities, similarly I mentioned 100 basis point expansion in wallet share since 2016, up 140, to be a little bit more precise and that\u2019s with those systematic in quant clients and half of that progress has happened this year to give you a flavor of some of the KPIs, but we know that the market is looking for the mark-to-market. We have mentioned $5 billion annual revenue in 3 years time without the market opportunity set expanding that\u2019s just work that we are doing. And we are going to give you that detail and you are going to hear it from us in the back half of this year. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. I think that, that will be really helpful. So, thank you for that. Just on something that is related, but is going to be maybe a little nitpicky given that it\u2019s a quarter, but I am just curious in the equities business, which you pointed to, the fact is you were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average I think so far about 20% year-over-year, granted there is 10 point sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I am just wondering were there any particular things that might have held you back in the equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward? Marty Chavez : I will start by saying our equities franchise, which I had the opportunity to co-head some number of years ago, it\u2019s one that I wouldn\u2019t trade for anyone else\u2019s equity franchise, it\u2019s global, it\u2019s balanced across cash and derivatives, we are doing exciting things in automation and engineering all over it. We have a leading prime platform and that business also had as you know in the second quarter of last year strong performance, solid performance and so the comp was tough. We breakout that segment as you know in three ways. So, it\u2019s more granular than the peer group. I mentioned one of those in specific, but I am happy to go into any of them if you would like, but let\u2019s say starting with commissions and fees, I will note that those revenues were stable and again it is just one quarter versus the second quarter with commission rates going down. And so while we always thought of 2018 as the year of adapting to MiFID II and observing and making changes in our business, we also highlighted for you that we had the view that MiFID II benefits would accrue, do scale players with leading research content and we are one of them and we are seeing abundant signs of that, picking up share from the lower tiers, people who do not have that kind of scale and diversification. The last thing I would say is that on the derivatives component which we highlighted, so in Equities Client Execution same year-on-year, but greater contribution from cash and lower from derivatives, some of those derivative transactions can be lumpy and we certainly have them in the second quarter and less of it \u2013 second quarter last year, less of it in the second quarter of this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. First, maybe just on follow-up on Marcus, I thought it was interesting that you are looking to expand in the UK, just what kind of drove that decision and could we see follow-through with perhaps a lending product in the UK or do we see other markets, do you enter other markets, how do we think about where that\u2019s heading? Marty Chavez : So, what drove that decision was the opportunity to continue to diversify our funding channels and we clearly saw that in the UK. And as we built out that offering, it fits all of the parameters that you have seen from us in our digital consumer finance offering so far and you will see more of them as we evolve the strategy. We are always considering new products. There are many new products that were determined to build in the U.S. and we are always considering them, expanding them geographically. And I have nothing beyond that to announce right now. Jim Mitchell : Fine, I mean you are not limiting markets to the domestic, I think is obviously the takeaway here. Marty Chavez : Absolutely not. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And maybe just a question on the SCB impact, obviously it\u2019s as you pointed out year-to-year it\u2019s going to be very different, is there other way if it stays as the economy continues to get better and the test seems to get tougher and tougher, is there a way to reduce stressed volatility in your view or do you think there might be changes to the test, so that is still a pretty big step up to the SCB from the prior buffer, I am just trying to think through that your model and some of the pure play investment banks tend to get \u2013 seem to get harder, let\u2019s say harder in the stress test, is there anything you see that\u2019s sort of easy to do that could help alleviate some of that or is it just sort of you got up that year-to-year? Marty Chavez : Well, let\u2019s start off by saying that the CCAR stress was hugely important for the safety and soundness of the financial system and it\u2019s an important part of our process and we are supporters of it. We also have our own capital management plan and framework and analytics. And our view is we have ample capital, where we are right now, so you know we are at 12.6%. Our benchmark for capital on standardized CET1 basis was 12.5% and we designed that policy and so that it is as I said want to give this ample capital. To step back and to look at the CCAR process, it was more severe. If you look across the industry, you will see that that the best SCB estimate using DFAST 2018 is in several cases higher than the current capital level. And the math is pretty straightforward, so for us it\u2019s 6% the peak to trough, add to that the 4.5% minimum and the 2.5% GSIB buffer, you get 13% without any management buffer, so that math is easy. And it is just one print. The Federal Reserve has said quite specifically that they view overall capital levels in the industry to be appropriate. And then also if you look back historically over 3 year to 5 year period as I mentioned for us the peak to trough has been 5, not 6. And there is a bunch of other things to consider here. The SCB is a proposed rule and as we know as rules become final all kinds of things happen. The regulators have been very specific that they are open to comments. You can see our bilateral comments to the Fed and you can see the industry rather, so we have certainly shared our views with the Fed. And we will wait and see how they will adapt, I can think of many ways averaging and so on and you said recalibration is one. There is many ways to comport these statements that results of this year\u2019s test are more severe with the Fed\u2019s statement that capital levels are appropriate for the industry across the board. The last thing I mentioned is that if the SCB is finalized, the relevant print would be DFAST 2019, not the one that we just saw. However, this all settles as we always do with the rules, we\u2019ll comply and we\u2019ll adjust them and it will be fine. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello Devin. Devin Ryan : Great. Thanks. Good morning Marty, I guess question here on Clarity Money and just what you guys have done since the acquisition, the strategy to drive more customers into the app and then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance wealth management growth especially as you had more products of the offering? Marty Chavez : Well, certainly \u2013 actually, I was just talking to Adam Dell this morning and if you walk into our building, you can see Clarity Money on the pillar and I have absolutely sometime ago downloaded it myself and used it. Generally, as you know, historically over time, our approach at the firm has been we build all our own software. And as we have discussed in the past, we have changed that approach to see can we find it in open source or can we find something that\u2019s already out there. And in the case of Clarity Money, we saw something that was beautifully designed from the user experience for the consumer and it made much more sense to join Clarity Money with our brand and our resources than to go build it on our own. And what we immediately saw in it and this is playing out is we saw it as a front door to all of the Marcus offerings, buy, save, spend, protect, invest and we saw it as a way to lower acquisition costs, which is a fascinating thing about the way that they have done it and we see it as a platform in which we can aggregate content and provide all of the services and products that we are developing in a consistent way, consistent brand and look and feel. Devin Ryan : Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe a follow-up here just on kind of the investment bank commentary, I mean, it seems that anytime we are talking about record backlogs, we get questions around whether we are close to a cyclical peak. So when you look across the franchise, how do you think about that just based on the metrics that you look at, meaning what areas seem to be maybe hitting close to on all cylinders and are there areas or regions where you just feel like there could be quite a bit of upside just to even get back to some type of baseline activity level? Marty Chavez : Well, the way I would look at the first half of 2018 is it was great results and no question that we are pleased with them. And it was a good opportunity set. It wasn\u2019t a fantastic or great opportunity set. And so it really demonstrates the potential of our franchise, all of the businesses, all of the segments first half on first half growing double-digit percentages, with really a modest improvement in the backdrop. Certainly in that macro backdrop, we see all kinds of things, which we have mentioned, GDP accelerating, CEO confidence, tax reform clarity, now that the reform act is behind us. All of those things suggest that momentum is strong and so there is a lot to play for in the back half of the year and going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Marty. Hi. Couple of questions for you. You pointed out that you guys were the number one provider or underwriter of leverage loans in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the underwriting trends you are seeing there since you are such a strong player in this market? For example, debt to EBITDA or other type of metrics that you guys look at, are they becoming more aggressive, less aggressive, can you share us some color there? Marty Chavez : So, sure. I will start by saying that we have been extremely successful in taking out bridges indicating risk. The vintages are profitable certainly in a small number of situations that have been a bit tougher. We have been well protected by the flex. And as we look at that business, we are seeing all kinds of evidence of the industry at large, our competitors re-pricing and changing the terms. And that\u2019s a dynamic that obviously is a good thing. Terms, as you have alluded to, had gotten tighter, but more recently they have re-priced. Our focus remains there always on the velocity of that book. And as for the LBO book itself, I would say it\u2019s important to acknowledge the size of that book is small. It\u2019s order of $7.5 billion and there is a couple of dozen transactions in the book and no one of those transactions is more than $1 billion. So, all of those parameters remain really well-controlled. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And in looking at your net interest income, you pointed out that it\u2019s at a run-rate of about $2.5 billion. Just under, I think 7% or so of total revenues. What do you see that, over the next 3 to 5 years, as Marcus grows and as you grow your corporate loan book, what do you think that can reach as a percentage of revenue? Marty Chavez : Well, we have certainly highlighted for you that we are emphasizing in our strategy not only expanding the client base and delivering more products and services to that expanded client base, but also revenue growth, earnings growth, more recurring, stable, fee-based revenues. And so I am not going to give a percentage overall firm target because we don\u2019t think about it in that way as a specific target, but it is something that we are working everyday to grow over the long-haul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Good morning, Al. Al Alevizakos : Hi, thank you. Hi, Marty. Thank you for the color that you gave on the equities business. I really appreciated the disclosure regarding the cash and the derivatives. However, I was mostly interested about prime brokerage. You basically suggested that the numbers were flat year-on-year despite the fact that it seems like all your peers said that year-on-year revenues were up. So I was trying to understand whether if it was an issue primarily with the margins or something happened regarding your volumes and you couldn\u2019t grow the business. And I have got a second question on asset management as well. Marty Chavez : So, let\u2019s start with that first question on prime. Yes, the revenues and securities services year-on-year are essentially flat, but inside that, it\u2019s important to say that client balances grew year-on-year, net spreads compressed and hence flat revenue all-in. Al Alevizakos : Okay, thanks for that. And then from a modeling perspective, I am just trying to understand on the asset management. First of all, is there any kind of seasonality in incentive fees that we can use going forward? And then secondly, would you say, I know that incentive fees are one-off by nature, but was there something particularly one-off this quarter? Marty Chavez : Yes. So there is no particular seasonality that I can think of to share with you on the recognition of incentive fees. These incentive fees are difficult to predict and they did in part drive the revenue beat in that segment. In this case, they were triggered by harvesting and the variety of funds, but one of them that I will mention is our Vintage 5 fund. So the harvesting of that triggered the recognition of the incentive fees in this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Marty Chavez : Hello, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, good afternoon or good morning still. Quick question on the NII that\u2019s in the I&L, I know you gave the run-rate of being $2.5 billion. Is there a way to kind of give what\u2019s been the biggest driver or what\u2019s the biggest contribution to that run-rate right now? Is it the merchant bank? Is it the corporate lending initiatives? And then kind of what was the corporate lending growth quarter-on-quarter? Marty Chavez : So it really is loan growth, very, very broad-based. And so if you look at our HFI loans receivable, they grew $3 billion on the quarter. So, they now stand at \u2013 I am sorry, 3%. They now stand at $74 billion and in dollar terms, they grew $2.4 billion. And there is a whole variety of components of that growth and essentially all of them grew and contributed to those figures that I just gave you. And it\u2019s really across corporate, private wealth management, our institutional lending and financing or SSG business as well as Marcus. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. And then just real quick of stress test that given your results in some of these specific loan categories tended to be much worse from what peers were specifically kind of looking at how your results came out within residential mortgage. So did that affect how you manage that business going forward, because it\u2019s hard to see how when the Fed has given you almost 50% cumulative losses that you have got to get an appropriate risk-adjusted return or risk adjusted return on invested capital with those kind of loss rate assumptions being built in? I mean is that just a portfolio that you can walk away from at some point? Marty Chavez : Well, we certainly look as you know at all of our businesses through a large number of metrics and the way they are treated in CCAR is certainly one of the many metrics. And it\u2019s an important one overall at the firm level. It\u2019s a binding constraint for us. And certainly, as we look at CCAR and we have been very public in saying this, we saw differences, divergences in our calculations from the Fed. We are always looking for more transparency and I am going to comment on an individual asset class as it plays through CCAR, but certainly more transparency into the process, in the modeling, in the calculations would benefit everyone. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Marty Chavez : Since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. Any additional questions arise in the meantime please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, have a great summer and we look forward to speaking with you on the third quarter call in October. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does include the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio and stress capital buffer. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that\u2019s posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today on the call, I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez; and our incoming CFO, Stephen Scherr. As Stephen is new to many of you, I\u2019d like to take a moment to introduce him. A 25-year veteran at Goldman Sachs, Stephen has held numerous leadership positions, beginning his career in Investment Banking and then on to Fixed Income, next heading our Financing Group in Investment Banking and later serving as our head of firm-wide strategy. Most recently, he was CEO of GS Bank and ran our Consumer & Commercial Banking Division, including Markets. With that, I\u2019ll pass the call to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning. I\u2019d like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Marty to walk through our third quarter results. First, let me begin by saying it\u2019s truly my pleasure to be here today as I take on my new responsibilities as CFO. I\u2019m excited about delivering on the core job itself and getting to know all of you in the weeks and months ahead. I must also say that I\u2019m thrilled to be part of the firm\u2019s new leadership team. David, John and I have worked together for nearly 20 years. We know each other well, see each other as partners in the business and share common objectives and goals for the firm. We jointly recognize the strength and importance of our client franchise, our people and our financial capital, and I\u2019m sure this is of particular importance to you. We intend to take a long-term view to driving strong shareholder returns. This is a key focus area for David and for the rest of the management team. With that said, let me briefly turn to two of our key priorities, which are amongst several areas we will cover in greater detail in the coming months. First, we believe that Goldman Sachs has amongst the strongest client franchises on The Street, with corporations, with governments and institutions and with a growing number of individual clients and customers across the wealth spectrum. But we also know that we can do more to deliver the whole of Goldman Sachs to our clients in a more seamless way. This is a key objective. We\u2019ve already begun to reexamine ways to deepen our client relationships by fostering easier access to all of Goldman Sachs. We also plan to continue to expand our reach to new clients of the firm. We will do so by better leveraging our core competencies of advice, risk management and technology solutions and by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within the firm. Importantly, we remain committed to executing on the revenue growth opportunities we laid out for you about a year ago. I will provide an update on these efforts in November. Second, we are reviewing all of our businesses, front to back, to ensure that our people and our financial resources are optimally deployed. Our objective here is clear : to improve shareholder returns. This is why David, John and I, along with the rest of the leadership team, will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term. We expect to continue this dialogue with you, focusing not only on further defining our business priorities but also on the metrics we will use to measure our progress. As we move ahead, we anticipate that we will have active and ongoing discussions with all of you. David will join our earnings call in January and is looking forward to being a participant in the quarters and years ahead. Finally, I would like to thank Marty for his many contributions to the firm as our CFO. We are fortunate that we will continue to benefit from his leadership in our Securities business. Adding Marty\u2019s deep understanding of technology and the firm\u2019s balance sheet to Ashok\u2019s market expertise and Jim\u2019s thorough knowledge of our client needs gives us the right mix of talent to lead the Securities Division. On a personal note, I\u2019m thankful to Marty for his partnership and guidance in ensuring a smooth transition. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Marty, who will walk us through third quarter results. Marty? Marty Chavez : Thank you, Stephen. I\u2019d want to share that I\u2019ve really enjoyed the opportunity to work with all of you, our analysts and our shareholders, during my tenure as CFO. I\u2019m also incredibly excited to take on a new leadership role in the Securities Division where I can serve our clients and further the firm\u2019s leadership in market structure innovation and automation. And I look forward to spending time with the investor community in my new role. I\u2019ll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses. And of course, we will be happy to answer any questions. Third quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion. Net earnings were $2.5 billion. Earnings per share were $6.28. Return on common equity was 13.1%, and return on tangible common equity was 13.8%. Turning to year-to-date results. We had firm-wide net revenues of $28.1 billion, the highest in eight years; net earnings of $7.9 billion; and earnings per diluted share of $19.21 was a record for the first nine months. We grew year-to-date revenues by 16% or $3.8 billion, and we delivered positive operating leverage, growing pre-tax earnings by 22%. Year-to-date, return on common equity was 13.7%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.6%, up by 340 and 370 basis points, respectively, versus last year. Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace. We grew our Institutional Client Services revenues by 16% or $1.5 billion, accounting for 40% of the year-to-date revenue improvement. That reflects an 18% rebound in FICC and a 15% increase in Equities where we continue to work to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client franchise. During the third quarter, while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued, including healthy global economic growth, particularly in the U.S.; strong CEO confidence; open financing markets; rising equity market valuations; and stable credit spreads. Despite the seasonal decline in client activity amid emerging market volatility and trade policy uncertainty, we saw improvement in September as our clients continued to seek our market-making services. While it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic given active client dialogues, healthy economic growth and resilient investor sentiment. Let\u2019s review individual business performance for the third quarter. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago, driven by a rebound in equity underwriting. Financial Advisory revenues were $916 million, up 14% relative to the second quarter, reflecting solid M&A volumes. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions totalling over $200 billion across more than 90 deals. Our announced volumes continued to outpace the industry, increasing 19% versus a year ago. Client engagement has improved notably across the Americas and Europe this year. Healthy dialogues on strategic activity continue across a broad base of sectors, including TMT, natural resources and health care, as well as from sponsor-related transactions. For the year-to-date, we ranked first in announced M&A, advising on over $1 trillion of volumes across 300 transactions, with a $125 billion lead over the number two competitor. Moving to Underwriting. Third quarter net revenues were $1.1 billion, down 14% versus the second quarter on seasonally lower volumes but up 20% versus a year ago. Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated, supported by strong activity in Asia. For the year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity and equity-related underwriting with over $55 billion of deal volume across 300 transactions. We also ranked number one in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes. However, our year-to-date performance was a record, reflecting strong client engagement and our multiyear investment in our acquisition finance business. Our Investment Banking backlog remains at robust levels but decreased versus a record second quarter, driven by M&A completions and underwriting. Our backlog still remains up significantly from a year ago. Clarity from U.S. tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, solid equity market valuations, significant private sponsor interest as well as corporate\u2019s desire for strategic M&A across sectors are all supporting healthy activity. Moving to Institutional Client Services; third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially but roughly flat versus last year. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago, driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity. Importantly, we continue to execute on our efforts to deepen and broaden our client relationships. We also are making significant investments in our capabilities and platforms to provide content, execution, data and analysis in modern digital formats. These efforts cover the entire client experience. On the execution side, we continue to generate strong growth. Our electronic FX volumes are up over 20% year-over-year. We now have over 2,000 active FX users on our Marquee single-dealer platform and are in the process of launching the next generation in the fourth quarter to better serve both institutions and corporate clients. In credit, we also continue to have success with our electronic corporate bond offering. Our credit algorithm now covers 10,000 U.S. investment-grade bonds, executing trades up to $2 million, allowing us to gain efficiency by electronically serving a significant portion of our investment-grade flow. Within that execution mandate, the GS corporate bond algorithm currently ranks number one in U.S. investment-grade volumes on the two largest electronic platforms. Turning to the individual FICC business performance in the third quarter. Currencies increased versus a year ago in both G10 and emerging markets, driven by higher activity and better performance. Commodities also increased versus a more challenged performance a year ago, helped by lack of headwinds in natural gas and power. Offsetting these improvements, rates declined significantly year-over-year amid low volatility and lower activity across government and inflation products, particularly in Europe. Credit declined amid sluggish activity across products and the smaller opportunity set. Lastly, mortgages declined versus last year, primarily on lower performance and volumes in CMBS. Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher U.S. equity market volumes and higher average volatility. Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago. Performance was supported by strength in our derivatives businesses, partially offset by lower cash revenues from program and on-exchange electronic trading. Commissions and fees of $674 million were down 12% sequentially but roughly flat versus a year ago. Nonetheless, we continue to see strength and market share growth in our low-touch volumes with meaningful year-over-year gains in all regions. Securities services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year, reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business. Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion, reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance. Mark-to-market on public securities reflected lower performance in Asia. On a year-to-date basis, our equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate. Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage. We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 46% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last four years. The remaining 54% is split, with 23% from investments made between 2012 to 2014 and with 31% made in 2011 or earlier, which are generally closer to harvesting. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $750 million. Results included approximately $700 million of net interest income, equivalent to a $2.8 billion annual pace. Our net interest income continues to grow as we increase more recurring revenue streams and lend more to our broad client base. Results this quarter also included a provision for loan losses of $174 million, primarily related to loan growth. Our I&L assets included approximately $105 billion in loans, debt securities and other assets and $21 billion in equity investments. In addition, we hold another $12 billion of consolidated real estate investments on the balance sheet. Let me also give you a quick update on our markets consumer business. Markets has evolved from a single-product to a multiproduct platform and today serves more than two million customers through our lending and savings products and our personal financial management app, Clarity Money. We were pleased to launch our fourth business late last month, entering the UK retail deposit market. Since launch through last Friday, we have raised nearly $2 billion of UK online deposits across more than 55,000 accounts. In addition, our U.S. retail deposits grew to over $26 billion at quarter end as we continue to expand and diversify our sources of funding. In our markets personal loans business, we held $4 billion of loans on our balance sheet at quarter end. We continue to monitor credit quality closely and remain very aware of where we are in the credit cycle. Our pace of loan growth will continue to be governed by our assessment of consumers\u2019 ability to pay and the overall macro environment. We are building this business for the long run, and we are not chasing volume targets. We will continue to grow deliberately and carefully. Next, turning to Investment Management, we posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter, driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses. Net revenues were down 8% sequentially, driven by significantly lower incentive fees but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees. Management and other fees were $1.4 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 9% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues were $174 million, down 4% versus the second quarter and up 4% versus last year. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.55 trillion, up $37 billion versus the second quarter. Results included $13 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter with inflows across all major categories, with particular strength in equities in quantitative solutions. In addition, we saw $8 billion of net inflows into liquidity products and $16 billion of market appreciation. Over the trailing five years, we attracted total cumulative organic long-term net inflows of approximately $225 billion. Now let\u2019s turn to expenses. We continue to monitor and manage our expense base carefully. We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure and platforms to grow the firm for the future. Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as benefits. We reduced our year-to-date compensation-to-net revenues ratio to 38%, down 200 basis points from the first nine months of last year, reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability. Non-compensation expenses year-to-date were $7.6 billion, up 17% or $1.1 billion versus a year ago. Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across markets, our consolidated investments and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing and exchange fees. We also saw roughly $215 million of expense increase related to the new accounting standard and a $149 million increase in litigation expense. On taxes, our year-to-date tax rate was 19%. We expect our full year 2018 tax rate to be materially consistent with the first nine months. This rate can vary and is based on a number of factors, including our overall level and mix of earnings and updated guidance from Treasury on the implementation of Tax Legislation. As we said previously, we will provide updates on our tax rate for future years once we have final guidance from Treasury expected this quarter. Turning to balance sheet, liquidity and capital, our global core liquid assets averaged $238 billion during the quarter, roughly unchanged from second quarter. We continue to expect this to decline as we redeploy our balance sheet to meet client needs. Our balance sheet was $958 billion, roughly flat versus the second quarter. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13.1% using the Standardized approach and 12.4% under the Basel III Advanced approach. Our ratios improved by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively, on a sequential basis. Overall, 40 basis points of the improvement was driven by an increase in common shareholders\u2019 equity and reduced market RWAs. The advanced ratio further improved, primarily on credit RWA reductions. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6%, up 20 basis points versus the second quarter. On capital return, we paid $311 million in common stock dividends and bought back $1.24 billion in the quarter in line with our $5 billion share repurchase authorization for the 2018 CCAR cycle. And over the past three quarters, we have now built back our Standardized CET1 ratio by 120 basis points, in line with our ratio before tax reform took effect. We have a strong capital position to both serve clients and invest for growth. Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We are pleased with our performance in the first nine months of 2018, which include our self-funded investments for future organic growth. Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses, and we continue to work hard to grow further from here. We also remain committed to driving positive operating leverage as revenues grow, which was clearly on display as pretax earnings are up 22%, driving our year-to-date ROTE of 14.6%. In addition, our strong competitive positions and continued execution enable us to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders. With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks. A follow-up on your dialogue around Marcus and the provision in I&L. So I heard you that most of this is related to growth. I\u2019m curious, at some point, are we going to see some of it related to seasoning as you grow and time goes on? And I think there was a story during the quarter that you pulled back maybe 10% versus your growth expectations. Are you seeing any signs of stress or delinquencies? Is that just prudent risk management? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks, Glenn. It\u2019s Stephen. I\u2019ll take that question. First, in terms of the pace of activity in Marcus, we have been underwriting and reunderwriting this business from the first quarter \u2013 we began in the fourth quarter of 2016 \u2013 and at each moment, taking stock of where we are, mindful of being potentially late in the consumer cycle. And so we have honed our underwriting standards and have watched where our vintages come in. The debate around 2019, which the press paid some attention to, is really about the level and pace of growth. In 2019, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll see an increase in originations relative to where we are in 2018. The debate is about the pace and size of that increase. And the decision we\u2019re going to make is entirely based on what we see in the portfolio, particularly as our vintages start to illustrate where we are, but equally mindful of where we are in the consumer cycle. I\u2019d say, by the way, on that, there\u2019s no material evidence to suggest that it\u2019s turning. But equally, we take stock of just how long this cycle has gone. And so we\u2019re quite careful, and 2019 will be about pace of growth, not whether we will grow. On the question I think you asked about reserves that we\u2019re taking, I would say that something on the order of about 1/3 of that was, in fact, related to Marcus. And it\u2019s important to understand that the reserve build around Marcus will be commensurate with growth, meaning as we take growth up and you\u2019re in that growth cycle, you\u2019re going to take more reserves. And at some point, you\u2019ll hit a level of stability where your reserves will, in fact, level off because you\u2019ve leveled off in terms of a static position in terms of loans on the book. But I think that right now, that\u2019s simply a function of the growth trajectory of the business from beginning to where we are. Glenn Schorr : Okay, appreciate all that. And then one follow-up on comp. Revs are up 16% year-to-date. You commented about your year-to-date ratio at 38% is down 200 basis points versus last year. Can\u2019t predict anything, but if the fourth quarter\u2019s somewhere in the range of in line with year-to-date trends, is it crazy to think we might see a much lower comp ratio versus last year, meaning in that same 100 to 200 basis points lower for full year? Marty Chavez : Glenn, this is Marty. On the comp ratio, as you know, it\u2019s \u2013 we see it as an output, not an input. Important that we attract talent and retain talent. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. The ratio that you see now, 38%, which is down two points from the first nine months of last year, down one point from where we had it in the first half of this year, is, as you would expect, our best estimate of the comp ratio with all the information that we have right now. And where the full year ratio ends up will depend on what happens in the fourth quarter, which we won\u2019t predict. One other thought, we had mentioned this in the past that it\u2019s important, as we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly, our focus is turning away from comp-to-net revenue ratio, where \u2013 which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where we\u2019re looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability. Glenn Schorr : Fair, okay. An accounting follow-up or just a geography thing. The $160 million tender gain, it was across both I&L and FICC and Equities. Do you have that breakout just so we could do our little sustainability numbers and what grew where? Marty Chavez : Sure, Glenn. I\u2019d be happy to break that down. So as you noted, it\u2019s $160 million in revenue on the debt tender. And the geography in our financial statements is approximately evenly split across FICC ICS, Equities ICS and I&L, so approximately evenly split across those three categories. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Stephen Scherr : Hello, Michael. Michael Carrier : Good morning. First one, just on the Investment Banking and the trading backdrop. Some of your competitors, you have mentioned that the competitive dynamics have gotten a little bit more intense more recently. Just wanted to get your take on what you guys are seeing, some of the \u2013 maybe the market share opportunities that you have set out over a year ago, how that\u2019s playing out and how much of that is either from like a competitive standpoint versus maybe some of the technology initiatives that you guys have been investing in that maybe you guys have more of a competitive advantage than some others. Marty Chavez : Well, Michael, on \u2013 I\u2019ll start with Investment Banking. We have, as you can see in the results, a leading position, and we continue to emphasize that and build on that. That position already at the top of the league tables is one that is an important part of our growth initiatives. So for instance, we have targeted 1,000 new clients, and we\u2019ve assigned coverage on 80% of those, and we\u2019ve done that with many new hires, which you\u2019ve seen in the news, and that\u2019s starting to play through in revenues. Going to FICC and Equities, those businesses, as we all know, are always, always competitive. And there, we have an historical strength in our platforms. We\u2019ve had our SecDB risk management platform for decades, and that is a differentiating part of our expertise in risk management. And we\u2019re leading in those extremely competitive businesses with content, scale and making it all client-centric and investing to modernize it with digital access, digital formats of many kinds, digital user experiences, over the Web, same tools that our people use, deploying them to clients, also giving clients the abilities to plug indirectly into our platform through APIs, which is very much a theme for us as well as all companies that are building and deploying technology for their clients. And we\u2019ve started to see that, again, also play through in revenues. We\u2019ve highlighted in the past our investment in our platform expansion to serve quant clients tailored for them but also a value to our traditional clients. And we\u2019ve seen, since 2016, about 180 basis points market share growth in low touch and half of that in the year-to-date. Michael Carrier : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one on the I&L outlook and backdrop. I think when we see more volatility in the market, sometimes that weighs on you guys and maybe the visibility on that business. Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing & Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth? And then maybe on the equity side, like GDP growth continues to be healthy. I guess just some perspective on different backdrops and how that can impact that business given that it\u2019s a little bit tougher to gauge. Marty Chavez : Absolutely. So I\u2019ll start by saying \u2013 and it\u2019s a theme that we\u2019ve discussed before, which is that these businesses are not market-beta businesses. They\u2019re franchise-adjacent. They are part of our franchise, both the equity and the debt part of I&L. So I will start with the equity part. There\u2019s two contributors. First of all, the Merchant Banking Division, then also our Special Situations Group. Starting with Merchant Banking, the portfolio\u2019s diversified across sector, across geography, across private equity and real estate. We have a sourcing and origination model that\u2019s distinctive, doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere. It\u2019s strongly connected to our IBD platform, to our institutional relationships with corporates, with private equity firms. And in addition, we\u2019re leveraging our GS domain expertise and knowledge to make the investment decisions. And in all of these platforms, we have a diversified lending portfolio that\u2019s got a differentiated sourcing mechanism with a long history of strong risk-adjusted returns. And so the drivers of that are going to be synergies with the rest of our platform and the differentiated content that we have as we make \u2013 as we harvest these investments. And so I would not think of it as linked to market beta. And of course, on the equity I&L line for both private and public, it will be affected by market valuations and levels. But the operating performance is really what\u2019s critical, and we saw that driving the results in that segment this quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, Marty and welcome to the call, Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you. Christian Bolu : So staying on FICC, just maybe follow up to the previous question. I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up an extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple of years. And then ultimately, when do you think some of these initiatives to expand the footprint will start to kind of actually play out in revenues? Marty Chavez : So there\u2019s, as you know, Christian, many things we\u2019re doing. And in the growth initiatives that we outlined, we\u2019re tracking those closely, and you\u2019re starting to see some of those initiatives play through in FICC specifically. There, as we emphasized when we laid out the growth initiatives there, they\u2019re not dependent on improvement in the market environment. And so there, wallet share is an important metric. And it\u2019s one that we\u2019re following closely and holding our people accountable. One of my colleagues who will be my co-Head in the Securities Division when I rejoin, Jim Esposito, has been doing this in banking for years and now is co-Head of Securities Division, the same kind of granular week-by-week, quarter-by-quarter tracking of where we are with the top 1,300 institutional clients. It\u2019s just one source of third-party market data but, in the coalition data for the first half of 2018, shows that with those 1,300 institutional clients mostly representing market-making, risk and remediation, we\u2019re number two in FICC and number two jointly across FICC and Equities. And we\u2019ve seen 30 basis points expansion in the wallet share since the end of 2016 with those clients. So just to step back and look at our strategy broadly, I\u2019ll just highlight four aspects of it. First, clients. In that business, as in all of our businesses, it begins and ends with the clients. So clients have risks they don\u2019t want, want risks they don\u2019t have. It\u2019s our job to help them understand their risks and to get them from A to B and to do that by providing them liquidity and doing that by providing them financing and having a seamless client experience front to back in platforms. Happy to go into it in as much detail as you\u2019d like. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll be spending a lot of my time. It\u2019s fundamental to our success in the business. And there, again, it\u2019s taking the tools that we\u2019ve developed for ourselves and sharing them very broadly with clients in a variety of formats, including for many clients who want to just plug in through APIs and get our data sets and risk analytics directly and plug into their computers, doing this all while optimizing our resources, managing our liquidity capital and expenses. What\u2019s exciting for me and for all of us is the world-class team that we have in that business. And our success is going to be driven really entirely by how effectively we bring together engineers, salespeople, bankers, traders to deliver that content and execution. Christian Bolu : Great, very comprehensive answer. Switching over to the Private Bank. At least by our numbers, feels like Private Bank lending is significantly underpenetrated relative to your peers. So curious how you think about the opportunity to expand then within that business. And then more broadly, could you update us on maybe progress on kind of your initiatives to grow the adviser base and client assets? Marty Chavez : We agree, and we are working on it. It\u2019s part of our growth initiatives that we outlined. And especially outside the U.S., where we\u2019re already strong, especially outside the U.S., we see significant opportunities. And we\u2019ll be coming back to talk to you about that. We\u2019re hiring and executing on it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: You guys had a nice increase in the capital this quarter. Obviously, it\u2019s a combination of retained earnings but also a decline in both assets and RWAs. And just wondering how much of that is kind of explicit efforts to optimize the balance sheet after CCAR. And if it is, is there further optimization you can do to get better positioned for 2019 and beyond CCAR? Marty Chavez : Well, of course, we\u2019re pleased at the success with which we have built capital over the past three quarters. As we reviewed, Standardized CET ratio is up 50 basis points sequentially, and it\u2019s putting it now 10 basis points above the level before tax reform hit. So that\u2019s a 120 basis point build. And we\u2019ve been doing this while having operating leverage, investing in all of our businesses. And so that\u2019s a fantastic result. It has been a focused effort across the firm. Now a large part of the improvement in the capital ratios is just performance. Retained earnings on the market RWAs, those have benefited, and that\u2019s a part of the driver of the improvement and lower volatility. And then on our credit RWAs, it\u2019s changing in composition of the loan book. So all of those effects are part of it. Stephen, would you like to add to that? Stephen Scherr : Yes. The only thing I would add to that is I think that the speed and efficiency with which our ratios recovered over three quarters following year-end, I think, speak volumes about the agility of the business to adjust. And I know there are often questions raised about changing circumstances in regulation and capital needs. And I think that if you look at the way in which we took our ratios up as quickly as we did, frankly, without negative consequence to the overall business, in fact, they rose by virtue of the strength of the business. So you see capital increase by virtue of retained earnings, and you look at the speed with which we turned velocity on the commitments made so that commitments are not sitting on the book for an extended time, all of these are inputs and variables that I think say a lot about the business\u2019 ability to adapt. And I just \u2013 I offer you that in the context of thinking forward to what may play out from a capital point of view and the organization\u2019s ability to adjust. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just sticking with capital, you\u2019ve made a couple of comments about updating and potentially expanding the growth efforts next month. To date, the vast majority of your growth initiatives have been organic. I think you\u2019ve had a couple of small deals below the radar. But would acquisitions be more of a part of the strategy going forward? Or what are the current thoughts on, call it, medium- and large-sized acquisitions? And then does the level of your stock, which is obviously off quite a bit this year, does that play into the thought process as well? Thank you. Stephen Scherr : Sure. It\u2019s Stephen. Why don\u2019t I take that question? I think that you should expect that in certain segments of our business, we will continue to be acquisitive. So in that context, acquisitions around our Consumer business have been made, and I think we\u2019ll continue to make them. They are immaterial in the overall size of the organization, but quite material in the context of aggregating both engineering talent and IP to develop that business more thoroughly. I think equally in the context of the Investment Management Division, historically, you have seen us make small acquisitions in that context because you can pick up teams or assets or sort of extend yourself into adjacent businesses. So I think in those two areas, you should expect us to be nimble and potentially acquisitive. I think in the size of those transactions, where stock stands as a currency is less relevant. Putting cash to that acquisition is perfectly reasonable and immaterial. Now I would say that inasmuch as we\u2019ll be acquisitive in those two areas, that\u2019s not meant to be a read across to the strategic sort of view of the firm more broadly. And so I don\u2019t want to have you come away thinking that those read across to major acquisitions that the firm would do. I simply want to point out that those are businesses where acquisitions are efficient, both, as I said, in the acquisition of talent and IP and equally time to market, particularly in the Consumer business where the opportunities may present themselves. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : I had a couple of questions. First, as it relates to the Marcus 2020 targets for $1 billion in revenues and $14 billion in outstandings, would you say that you\u2019re pulling back from those targets, which seems to be fine if you\u2019re seeing conditions change? Stephen Scherr : So on your question on Marcus, I would say that it\u2019s important to recognize that there are a number of different components to Marcus that contribute to the 2020 objective. Unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one, but equally, the value of deposits in that franchise being another, and then there may well be other opportunities that present themselves in terms of new business between now and then. And so it\u2019s a mix of different businesses. And I\u2019d point out that even if we work on moderate growth, the growth would still be in place in lending for 2019, but we were to moderate it. If you just look at the rather explosive growth in the deposit platform, particularly in the UK., so we are not two or three weeks in and have nearly $2 billion equivalent of UK. deposits, the FTP value on that will be significant. I guess the point I\u2019m making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch through the target, meaning we\u2019re not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet. If, in fact, the market and the environment is not hospitable to us, and we will watch it carefully but not grow against the gale wind. We don\u2019t see that wind yet, so we\u2019ll continue to grow, but the point being there are multiple sort of avenues by which we\u2019ll hit that target in 2020. Mike Mayo : And then two separate questions. Stephen, you mentioned one strategy is to deliver the entire Goldman Sachs to deepen client relationships. I guess from our perspective, you guys crush it with the relationships with the CEOs of corporations, but you don\u2019t get your fair share of the business given those relationships at the top of the house. Correct me if I\u2019m misunderstanding that. So what metric would you look at, like what share of wallet, say, you have of corporation today? And where would you like that to be? Or help me how to think about that. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So historically, in Investment Banking, which have been the principal owners of corporate relationships, you\u2019re right to point out that the relationship by and large went to the top of the house. I will tell you, just from my own experience in that business, that the relationships now have really broadened quite considerably over the last several years. And frankly, I\u2019d go back to the financial crisis when liquidity was dear that liquidity and capital raising for companies became strategic and moved its way into the office of the CEO. And so the relationships that our teams have now go well beyond the CEO and extend into CFOs, treasurers, assistant treasurers in the context of what\u2019s there. I\u2019d also say that our relevance in the context of activity with which we can engage corporates on has grown quite considerably. And frankly, that\u2019s been commensurate with credit expansion that we have made to a number of our clients as a general matter. And so if you will, our petition for a broader set of business I think is more real and more credible than it\u2019s been in a long, long while. And finally, I\u2019d say \u2013 and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy. And I think our ability to capture it now is more real than it would have been years ago. But equally, I\u2019d point out that when you look at the tangible addressable market that, that represents relative to the traditional product sets that we\u2019ve been in, it almost doubles. So just imagine, when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in number one positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses, and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that we\u2019ve not played in before. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. So starting off on Marcus, I think you indicated the reserve build for the portfolios overall and gave us a split into Marcus, and it seems like that\u2019s running at about a 7% build on new loans. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the right math and if you can talk us through how you think about reserving for Marcus. Is it on a 1-year forward basis? Is it on a longer-term basis than that? And if you could just update us on the FICOs of the portfolio on where your new loans are coming out in terms of a FICO band? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So as I said, I think, in response to a question earlier, our reserve build has been commensurate with loan growth, and it\u2019s not a function of any perceived deterioration in the book itself. While I don\u2019t have the specific numbers, I will tell you that we reserve at differentiated levels across the aggregate loan book such that we reserve at a higher level for Marcus loans relative to what we would be reserving on other loans. And that should not come as a surprise because the Marcus loans are unsecured, and we have security in a vast majority of the balance of the loan book that\u2019s there. And so it\u2019s differentiated and tailored as it ought to be and as it\u2019s required to be based on the perceived risk that\u2019s there. And I think so long as we remain in a growth mode, you\u2019ll continue to see that increase commensurate with the growth itself. Betsy Graseck : And the differentiation is within Marcus as well? Or you\u2019re just talking about between Marcus and different \u2013 other loan product? Stephen Scherr : Yes, let me be clear, it\u2019s not differentiated within Marcus itself. It\u2019s differentiated as between Marcus and other loans that sit on our books. Let me also come back to the question you asked around FICO scores. Our FICO bands still skew into the 700s. Candidly, there has not been a change from the time we originated to where we are now. We trend high on the FICO band, and we\u2019ll continue to sort of stay above 660 or better in the context of our forward-going underwriting in Marcus. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on the UK side, you indicated, what, $2 billion in deposit growth over 55,000 accounts. Did I get those numbers right? Stephen Scherr : You did. In fact, the numbers have increased since the numbers we cited you on Friday. I mean, those numbers now are at about 75,000, and well into $2 billion equivalent of deposits would have been raised. And I think what\u2019s interesting is that this is now filling out with strategic intent that we had from the very beginning around retail deposits, beginning in the U.S. and now evident in the UK, which is the opportunity for us to sort of engage in retail deposit gathering as a substitution for the predominance of wholesale funding, I think holds out enormous strategic value for us. And it\u2019s now sort of playing through that way, and we\u2019ve been super pleased with the progress on deposits in the U.S. And equally, as you can imagine, just given the pace of growth of deposits in the UK, that\u2019s proving to be a very, very valuable channel for us. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So wanted to start off with a question on capital on the SCB. Stephen, it was encouraging to hear you speak about your commitment to deliver improved shareholder returns, the plans to evaluate the different businesses. I\u2019m just wondering, given the uncertainly relating to how the stress capital buffer rules are ultimately going to unfold and the expectation for further delays beyond the next few months, how do you handicap the impact of changing rules and evaluate through-the-cycle returns across your different businesses? Marty Chavez : Well, Steven, I\u2019ll start with that and then turn it to Stephen. So on the SCB, we are a vigorous participant in the industry conversations. You\u2019ve seen our bilateral letter that we filed with the Fed, and we know that the Fed is listening. At the same time, we don\u2019t know the form that the final rule will take. And any thoughts on when SCB will be incorporated into CCAR would just be speculation on our part, so we won\u2019t do that. But I will say that as for the final form that the rule takes, we\u2019ll be prepared. Stephen referenced our agility in building capital to the level that we\u2019ve got right now. We\u2019ll continue to have that kind of agility, and we\u2019ll be ready for SCB to be a part of CCAR 2019, and equally, we\u2019ll be ready for SCB to be part of a later CCAR, in which case we continue to be bound by SLR. As you know, we support the underlying concept of SCB, which is linking spot and stress capital. The details are really important. Stephen? Stephen Scherr : I would only add to that, that as I said earlier, we need to run and guide the firm with customer and client centricity at its core. And in doing that, of course, we\u2019re mindful of the potential for changing circumstances in capital rules, and we need to be nimble in the context of how we adapt to them, just as we were over the last three quarters to adapt to change occasioned by tax. I would say that from the perspective of David, John and myself, we\u2019re undertaking now a mark-to-market on the business, as you would expect any new leadership team to do. And in that context, we\u2019re looking to rationalize costs and make sure our costs are right front to back. But equally and to your question, capital\u2019s a scarce resource, and we need to ensure that capital is being allocated appropriately to businesses that can hurdle what we care to hold out for them in the context of ways in which we can serve customers and clients. And so I would only represent to you that with capital as a scarce resource and the potential for capital rules to change and for us to stay nimble yet serve our clients, we need to go through this exercise in a very, very detailed way and then make very hard decisions about where capital ought to be deployed as in across different businesses to do what I said at the beginning is our intent, and that\u2019s to yield a positive shareholder return on the back of our activities. Steven Chubak : Thank you both. That\u2019s incredibly helpful color. And then just one follow-up for me on operating leverage. We saw some nice efficiency improvement in the quarter. Marty, I appreciate your color speaking to how you view expenses and managing efficiency more holistically. I\u2019m just wondering how much of the improvement this quarter was a function of revenue mix. And then looking over the next couple of years, it feels like expectations are flat and assumption around continued revenue growth somewhere in the mid-single-digit range, but really no operating leverage improvement. I was hoping you could speak to your commitment to delivering improved margins and profitability if that revenue growth materializes. Stephen Scherr : Sure. It\u2019s Stephen. Why don\u2019t I take that with a sort of forward-going look? So if you look at the three quarters, our revenues were up 16%, and our expenses together were up 13%. And here, I\u2019m not distinguishing between comp and non-comp. I\u2019m just looking at expenses overall. So a 3% delta over the three quarters, and that includes considerable expenditure in the context of growth. And so what I find positive in that and a guide toward where we will be is that we\u2019re going to look to continue to fund our growth from within the business and all the while produce operating leverage in the business. I think that expectations ought to be modest in \u2013 through the balance of this year, but equally and through 2019 as we stay on a growth theme and make the kind of expenditures that Marty was referring to, which we think have positive IRR and will yield long-term \u2013 frankly, medium- to long-term positive return for shareholders. Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and you\u2019ll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves. And so I\u2019d just draw that \u2013 I\u2019d distinguish in sort of time segments without being overly precise as to what I expect to continue in the near term and then what can happen over the longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one on the loans receivable. I think that you \u2013 at least from the last Q, about half of the loans receivable balances is in corporate exposures. So just wondering if maybe you could give some color around what types of loans those are, what portion might be tied to deals or look like levered loans, how much of those are secured? I think, Marty, you spoke to the fact that you guys are approaching cyclical risk with prudence, which is clearly reassuring. Just maybe helpful to get some of those stats around the portfolio. Marty Chavez : Sure, I\u2019ll take you through that. Happy to. So if you look at the loan book in aggregate, about 80% of it is secured. Many components to that loan book, some of it is, for instance, in real estate, it\u2019s nearly 100% secured. And the institutional part of that portfolio, it is also diversified. Of course, those are relationship lending, IBD corporate, there\u2019s middle-market lending. And then I\u2019ll mention a couple of other items. So the Private Wealth Management and GS Select part of the loan book is 98% secured. And then, Marcus, of course, is not secured, but as Stephen has described, we have an intense focus on the credit profile. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Guy Moszkowski : Good morning. This question I think is going to build a little bit on some of the earlier comments that you\u2019ve made on platforms and margins going forward. But I wanted to take a look at, for example, FICC, which has struggled over the years in this quarter, again has a significant revenue downturn. But can we go below the surface and talk a little bit about margins? As that business becomes more of a platform business, more digitized, can you give us a sense for what\u2019s been going on with the margin? Are we looking, to some extent, at pricing coming down as the business is more digitized but, on the other hand, the margin improving because of that? Marty Chavez : Well, this is one of my favorite topics, so I\u2019m happy to go through what we\u2019re doing on platforms. There\u2019s so many themes here, and they all relate to margin and scale. So just \u2013 it is just the way of the world of compression wherever you look, and that\u2019s driven by technology and data. And that\u2019s a trend that we\u2019re embracing, not resisting. And this is and remains a people business. And at the same time, we want to give our people tools so that they do the things that people can do best and always will do best and then leave to machines things that the machines do best, right, just as I wouldn\u2019t want to compete with my HP 12C to see who can add or multiply faster. And that\u2019s a general theme. So across securities but I\u2019ll emphasize FICC since you asked about it, we\u2019re in the middle of a large project, which we\u2019ve been funding organically, to reengineer the legacy systems. We have them, everybody has them, to eliminate manual work and drive scale. An important theme, as data becomes, and we all know this is the fuel for the economy, using that data and carefully and appropriately, hugely important in all businesses, especially in our business, to provide results that are better for the clients, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in Marquee. I mentioned the real effort we\u2019re doing in the fourth quarter. We have a huge ambition to create a cross-asset, integrated agency and principal platform for accessing liquidity across all of the products and making that liquidity available to our clients in a variety of formats over the voice channel, our people using those tools, clients using the tools, clients plugging into our computers directly. And so all of this is happening as that business becomes increasingly automated, we\u2019re taking many of the same themes that have been very successful for us in our equity business. I highlighted some of them in the prepared remarks. Our bond pricing engine quoting 10,000 CUSIPs. That number\u2019s only going up. The $2 million size, that number we\u2019d expect to go up. The development of ETFs in credit is transforming that business, creating the capability for portfolio and program trading along the lines of what we\u2019ve done in Equities. And so there\u2019s a lot of parallels to Equities. Of course, the market structure is different, and these businesses will evolve differently and at different speeds. But the lessons we\u2019ve learned of building tools, having a tool-driven culture, putting those tools in the hands of our people and clients, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive margin efficiency and scale. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just talk a little bit about the strategy in Marcus longer-term? I think you mentioned potentially adding more products. I mean, as you kind of go downmarket a little bit in wealth management with Ayco, how do you see this evolving? Do you see going \u2013 pursuing sort of more of a retail wealth brokerage-type model layer on to Marcus? Seems like brokerage could be kind of a core competency. How do you think about that, adding those kind of businesses longer-term? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, I would say we began with Marcus on a product-by-product basis, in part because it was prudent execution and it was cautious, and we needed to ensure that we would get it right and play it right. But our ambition was never to just be a bespoke set of products. What we want to offer out to consumers and millions of consumers is an opportunity to engage with us so as to improve their own financial engagement and the like. And to that end, we\u2019re building a platform. Clarity Money, which is an app that we acquired, can present itself as the front door, where it offers consumers an ability to manage their balance sheet and their cash flow and all the while give them a financial wallet off of which they can then take part in a platform that would be made up of products, some of which \u2013 many of which will be our own, some of which may not be our own. Obviously, deposits and lending are just the two products as of now that sit on that growing and developing platform. As I look forward, there are a number of opportunities for us on the product set. One certainly, as you\u2019re referring to, is wealth and a more mass affluent wealth product. I think that we\u2019re particularly well positioned to do that in the context of the adjacency that exists between our Investment Management Division and Marcus, where we have an extraordinary factory floor in GSAM that can build and develop product. That product can be put on in more mass affluent wealth platform. And so I think wealth, as you allude to, is an area that we should certainly focus on. I would also say on the topic of adjacencies, and this is to make the point that as we develop a broader, bigger Marcus platform, there are adjacent channels and avenues in and around the firm that we can avail ourselves of, okay? One, you alluded to is Ayco. Ayco is an extraordinary channel that sits within the Investment Management Division and has and does present us with an opportunity to go in through the business to get to consumers. So, think of B2B2C, and they have relationships with formidable companies and the ability to offer Marcus at work, just as an example, is sort of a channel that can be pursued. And so Marcus as a platform is not to be viewed as an island within the firm. I\u2019d also say that we have opportunity by virtue of relationships that exist with corporates through Investment Banking, to take those relationships and look to develop partnerships with consumer-facing organizations. And frankly, that will lower our cost per acquisition on customers of Marcus. And so I offer this out not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward road map might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we try to build with respect to consumers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Stephen Scherr : Hello, Devin. Operator : Devin, check your phone has been put on mute. Devin Ryan : Good morning. Sorry about that. And the first question is on the Equities business and just the success you\u2019re having on a relative basis as well. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of concern just heading into the year around the business, particularly with MiFID II implantation, but revenues are now up, I think, about 15% year-to-date. So you\u2019re clearly taking market share there. And so now that we\u2019ve had some data to look at, can you see whether you\u2019re consolidating market share in areas that maybe MiFID is most directly impacting, so you\u2019re winning on that front? Or is it maybe growth coming from other places or mix? It\u2019s just a little bit tough from the outside to strip it out, so would love to get some color on the success there. Marty Chavez : Sure, happy to go through that. So you\u2019re correct, revenues year-to-date for the Equities segment are up 15%. And going into the quarter, as a main driver of the quarter is client activity. We also highlighted year-on-year strength on derivatives. Now over the last several years, if you look at the cash and derivatives contribution to equities client execution, it\u2019s evenly balanced, though it can, of course, change from quarter-to-quarter. And as we\u2019ve highlighted in previous calls, we have scale, we have depth and breadth of products across cash and derivatives, a variety of product formats, strength in prime, which goes from strength to strength and diversified regionally. And we wouldn\u2019t trade that business for anyone else\u2019s. We\u2019ve definitively seen ourselves picking up market share, as you referenced. We see that in third-party statistics of various kinds. I talked about earlier how we\u2019ve grown our wallet share in low touch. And so that is a part of the investments that we\u2019ve been making. Now you referenced MiFID II. And MiFID II is an important driver of \u2013 it is not the only one, of something that\u2019s happening across the system, which is consolidation in the top three scale players. As we were preparing for MiFID II implementation, on these calls and in other formats, we said that we expected the MiFID II reforms to actually benefit the scale players, those with differentiated content and execution capabilities as well as research. And we are one of those. We\u2019re investing to be certain that we continue to remain there. And definitively, we\u2019ve seen, especially in Europe but also globally, market share concentrating in the top 3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. You guys have been very cognizant of the credit cycle. You\u2019ve talked about where we are relative to the consumer side. Can you remind us, in the underwriting of the Marcus loans, what are you underwriting for in terms of the peak loss rate? When we get into a down credit cycle recession, nobody knows when that will happen, but we all recognize credit losses for everybody will go up. Can you remind us what you think the \u2013 how the Marcus portfolio will perform in that environment and what the peak credit losses could be? Stephen Scherr : So the way we have approached Marcus is that in each vintage, we price our book in order that it could incur a doubling of the modeled loss and leave us in a break-even position, obviously with the exception of whatever we had paid for the acquisition of the customer itself. So putting those expenses aside, loss scenario, we price for a doubling of loss, again, to put us at a break-even. And our own thinking is not different than yours in the context of where we are. As I said at the start, there\u2019s been no manifest evidence to suggest that it is or has turned. But knowing that we\u2019re long in the cycle, we\u2019re attentive to our underwriting. I\u2019d also point out that in the context of the six or seven quarters since we began, by virtue of what we\u2019ve built from a clean technology slate, we\u2019re on to our 10th or 11th iteration of the underwriting box. And that is one in which we learned from data both on-premise and off-premise, so what we learn from our own portfolio as well as what we can glean from publicly available information. And we continue to hone our underwriting box and back-test it against prior vintages. But all the way along, we stand to our own imposed policy of ensuring that we price for a doubling of loss. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I had two questions and the kind of the same kind of focus. But if you look at 1,000 new customers, you\u2019re talking about attracting new sales reps and trying to expand, are we \u2013 Goldman years ago had kind of consolidated up towards the top end of the market. Are you thinking about going downstream more to institutional customers that are maybe middle market? And are you \u2013 what segments are you most interested in, in that case? Stephen Scherr : So thanks for the question. I\u2019d answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning if I look at Investment Banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities, where we had not formally been and to look to expand the client base, because there\u2019s very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients. And I don\u2019t particularly view it as going downmarket so much as expanding the aperture on, in the case of Investment Banking, just the geography of where we are and what we\u2019re going to do. And we\u2019re seeing some manifest success in that context. There were 10 notable transactions derived from an expanded footprint, which had meaningful P&L consequence to the business. In the context of the Securities business, I would look at both Equities and FICC and say that part of what sits in front of us and the leadership of that division is a changing skew on the customer base, which is looking at corporates as an expanded client set or customer set for both FICC and equity products. Markets, it\u2019s obvious and self-evident in terms of that being a new consumer base for the firm more generally. And then I\u2019d look at middle-market lending, which sits in the I&L line. And as Marty alluded to, in the quarter, we generated $700 million of net interest income, which is recurring. It\u2019ll have a run rate of about $2.8 billion annually. And I view that as very stable, meaning if you look down the roster of loans that sit in that segment, they look very much like what you would find at big money center banks, and it has not been, to this point, an area of focus for us. And we come at those clients not with a single product but rather with a range of different products such that we sit at the top of the capital structure in a better risk position and avail these customers and clients with the kind of liquidity and access to capital they need. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Thank you. So since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 16, 2019. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will use a new earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. [Technical Difficulty] reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent.  Today on the call, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. As noted on the agenda on Page 1 of the presentation, David will provide introductory remarks about our strategic priorities, perspectives on the macro environment and an update on 1MDB. Then Stephen will walk through our financial performance. They'll be happy to take your questions after that.  I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm very happy to be here with you, and I look forward to joining this call in a more regular basis. I'm going to start off this morning by reiterating that I'm fully committed to an active and ongoing dialogue with our shareholders and our broader stakeholders. I'm excited about our new call format and presentation, which is an initial step as we continue to enhance engagement and disclosure.  As shown on Page 2, it is important to underscore that our overarching priority is to execute our core mission : Serving our diverse client franchise, which includes corporations and governments, institutions and individuals; executing on our client-centric model will drive long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders. We remain committed to delivering a full range of services to our clients, including advice, market liquidity, investment management and financing. As many of you know, John, Stephen and I are conducting a comprehensive front-to-back review across each of our businesses, including 3-year forward plans to identify opportunities to strengthen or expand our client footprint and to operate more efficiently. We are also pursuing new ways to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client footprint by developing new products and business platforms.  As our strategic business reviews are progressing, let me highlight some early findings, which are shown on the right side of Page 2. Starting with our market-making business in FICC and Equities, we've spent a significant amount of time, evaluating all aspects of our businesses, including our delivery model, with a focus on providing best-in-class client experience and execution. To achieve this, we will continue to invest in automation and platform enhancements. We are also actively engaged in pursuing opportunities to grow our addressable market by broadening client relationships and improving our mix of products, services, particularly the corporates. Specifically as it relates to FICC, we have a leading institutional market-making franchise. Clients tell me we have differentiated people and capabilities, particularly in the intermediation of large complex risks. But let me be direct. We're fully cognizant of the reduction in the industry wallet over the past decade. And as Stephen mentioned at the Bank of America Merrill Conference, we will not be complacent waiting for the market to return. We are running the business with a clear perspective of its revenue potential.  Over recent years, we've made significant progress on improving capital utilization and reallocating capital away from FICC commensurate with its potential in order to grow strategically, important and higher returning businesses. We will continue to optimize capital in the business. We also see an opportunity to further reduce expenses. We're investing in automation as we expect many businesses within FICC to evolve similarly to equities. All these efforts will position our franchise to remain a provider of choice while improving returns for our shareholders.  Secondly, we have a world-class alternatives investing franchise, which has generated strong returns over 3 decades. We have one of the most unique sourcing platforms given our global footprint of broad network. Our franchise presents us with extraordinary opportunities to partner with clients to invest their capital alongside our own. Based on our track record, there is an opportunity to raise additional third-party funds across equity, credit and real estate, thereby augmenting fee income. Simultaneously, we can continue to monetize on-balance sheet investments and optimize capital consumption.  Next, on cash management. As we evaluated opportunities to improve services to our clients and expand our franchise, cash management presents an illogical area for us given the breadth of our corporate relationships and the size of that wallet. In addition, the pace of technological change in the payment space gives us confidence that it is appropriate time for us to address this opportunity. We are now 6 months into a 2-year build, and our firm will be first to use a cash management platform later in 2019. In addition to validating the product, doing our own operational payment flows will reduce costs and operational risk. Among all -- assuming all progresses as planned, we expect to launch the product to clients in 2020.  Lastly, as we bring markets and the business of Investment Management closer, we will continue to evolve markets from a single product to a multiproduct platform. We now serve 3 million customers through our lending and savings products in Clarity Money. We plan to further enhance the platform to include multitiered mass affluent digital wealth offering, which is currently in development. We are confident this collaboration will be a catalyst for the successful execution of this strategy over time.  Across these and other investments for growth, combined with a significant focus on operating efficiency, we are beginning to deliver on our commitment to enhance the durability of our revenues and our earnings. We continue to review our strategic priorities with our board and plan to communicate a more comprehensive update to the market in the coming months. Additionally, later this year, we plan to share specific metrics and financial targets we will use to hold ourselves accountable. Ultimately, we will operate the firm to drive leading shareholder returns over the cycle. Before we discuss our results, I'll make a few observations on the operating environment. Some of which are highlighted on Page 3. Recently, there has been quite a disconnect between the weak market sentiment and the optimism we continue to see in corporate board rooms. The fourth quarter, particularly December, was characterized by a decline in investor sentiment with respect to the global growth outlook. A concern that central banks would continue to tighten into a slowing growth environment cause weakness in equity and credit markets and resulted in an increase in volatility of many macro assets. While this has created challenges for many of our institutional investing clients, it is also driving potential future opportunities for active managers to add value.  In addition for now the absolute level of activity in the real economy remains fairly robust, and this is reflected in broad CEO sentiment and our Investment Banking transaction backlog. Despite the global uncertainties, including U.S. China trade policy, Brexit, the planned removal of monetary policy stimulus in Europe and the recent yield curve flattening, our economy still see global growth of 3.5% next year, including 2.4% in the U.S., 1.6% in the Euro zone, over 6% in China and an acceleration to 2% in Latin America. Notwithstanding the mixed market and macro backdrop, we remain actively engaged with our clients across our franchise. Corporations continue to seek advice for strategic transactions, and there is a need for both equity and debt financing. Financial markets are open, and investors continue to need execution services, intellectual capital, hedging and liquidity solutions. Clients continue to need comprehensive asset wealth management advice, and individuals need simple and transparent financial services that add value.  Next, I'd like to take a moment to address the ongoing investigations related to matters with the Malaysian sovereign development fund, 1MDB. I want to proactively address some of your questions that I know are on the minds of our stakeholders. First, we are cooperating with the Department of Justice and other regulators and are focused on a timely but deliberative process. We believe that we have established important facts in our own review of this matter over the last 3 years, and we, of course, would like to provide more information to you. But for now, this is still an open investigation, and we will naturally respect that process.  It's very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals, including the highest members of the prior government. Tim Leissner was a partner at our firm, by his own admission, was one of those people. For Leissner's role in that fraud, we apologize to the Malaysian people. As you would expect, we have looked back and continue to look back to see if there is anything that we as a firm could have done better. At the same time, I want you to know before each transaction considerable due diligence was conducted. When control functions in other -- in the firm asked if each transaction whether any intermediaries were involved, they were told no. Tim Leissner himself said no intermediaries were involved in the transaction. As detailed in the government's charging documents, Leissner purposely concealed from the firm his scheme with Malaysian government officials, IPIC officials, 1MDB and Jho Low.  Significantly, and again as a part of our due diligence efforts at the time, we sought and received written assurances from both 1MDB and IPIC that no intermediaries were involved in the first 2 transactions. And in the final offering, the government of Malaysia itself and 1MDB represented that no intermediaries were involved in the offering. All these representations to Goldman Sachs have proven to be false. Also during this period, 1MDB's outside auditors with access to the books and records issued clean audit opinions. In addition, I want to address the issue of Jho Low and how he was viewed during and after the transactions. We declined Jho Low's request to open a private wealth account in 2010 because we could not verify the source of his wealth. Out of prudence, we also declined to advise or represent Low on other opportunities he presented to us between 2011 and 2014. That said, during the same period of time, Jho Low's involvement in a number of transactions unrelated to 1MDB was well known to a number of financial institutions, including us.  In fact, before, during and after the 1MDB transactions, Low engaged with major companies, investors and other financial institutions in acquiring highly visible assets, from media to real estate. Clearly, a lot more is known about Jho Low today and at that time. This has been a difficult time, but I'm proud of how our firm has remained focused on our clients. Our client franchise, including in Asia, remains extremely strong. There are always important lessons to be learned from difficult situations, and it is a priority for me that we are self-critical and reflective to ensure that our culture of integrity, collaboration and escalation only improves from this experience. Please appreciate that I've tried to be as forthcoming as possible on my comments on 1MDB. I know that many of you will have additional questions, but I'm sure as you can understand, I can't say much more.  With that, let's switch gears and review our performance as highlighted on Page 4. For 2018 full year, the firm reported solid results. We generated firm-wide net revenues of $36.6 billion, our highest in 8 years. We delivered a return on equity of 13.3% and return on tangible equity of 14.1%. Importantly, we are making significant investments to further expand our client franchise, grow revenues and enhance the long-term earnings profile of the firm, the cost of which is being funded by the embedded operating leverage in our businesses.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with our performance. We delivered a solid year, and our 2018 results leave us on strong footing to pursue our strategic objectives in 2019 and beyond. The team I have assembled to execute on our priorities, including John and Stephen, have an increased sense of urgency and discipline to help move our business forward.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Stephen, who will walk us through the details of our financial performance. Stephen? Stephen Scherr : Thanks, David. Let me begin with an overview of our financial results on Page 5 of the presentation. The firm reported fourth quarter net revenues of $8.1 billion, resulting in $36.6 billion for the full year. We had net earnings of $2.5 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year and earnings per share of $6.04 in the quarter, resulting in $25.27 for the full year.  Before I begin the detailed discussion of our results, I want to cover a few adjustments to our financials. First, to increase transparency and make our results more consistent with our competitive set, we now present our net revenues before credit provision. We have added a credit provision line to the income statement, and prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This has no impact on our bottom line results, but will give a basis for clear comparison.  Second, expenses related to consultants and temporary staff previously reported in compensation and benefits expenses are now reported in professional fees. This also has had no impact on the bottom line, but does result in $280 million being transferred between the line items for the full year. This change also reduced headcount by approximately 3,400.  In addition to the changes in the presentation of our financial statements, I would call out the following 2 items. First, our fourth quarter results included net provisions for litigation and regulatory matters of $516 million. Our total provisions for litigation and regulatory matters in 2018 amounted to $844 million. This obviously elevated our operating expense line for the year. Second, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%. This rate includes a $487 million discrete benefit from a true-up of our prior estimate of the impact from 2017's tax legislation. The benefit reflects the impact of updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by Treasury. The 16% rate also includes the $269 million benefit related to equity-based compensation for the year. These 2 items, the tax true-up and equity-based compensation, account for approximately 6 percentage points of the decrease in our tax rate from our projected normalized rate of approximately 22% to 23%. It is important to highlight that pretax earnings increased $1.3 billion or 12% in 2018. This equates to an increase of approximately 130 basis points in return on common equity after normalizing for taxes year-over-year. This improvement in our operating performance was despite materially higher litigation expenses.  Now let me turn to the results overall. As David mentioned, the environment in 2018 turned out to be mixed. The first 3 quarters demonstrated continued strength in global equity and credit markets despite geopolitical uncertainty. The fourth quarter witnessed higher levels of market volatility, increased client engagement and negative performance across virtually all asset classes. Against this evolving backdrop, we concentrated on serving our clients and investing to drive our business forward.  Our overall performance in 2018 demonstrates the value of our diversified business model and the strength of our client franchise. This is reflected in the balanced revenue contribution from across our businesses as shown on the pie chart on Page 5 of the presentation. Further, 61% of 2018 net revenues were generated by fee-based or more recurring sources versus 48% just 5 years ago.  Turning to Page 6 and our individual segments. Investment Banking had an outstanding performance in 2018, producing near-record results. In the fourth quarter, the business produced net revenues of $2 billion, up 3% versus the third quarter as a significant pickup in M&A completions helped offset a decline in underwriting revenues as the difficult market backdrop slowed issuance volumes globally. Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion, up 31% relative to the third quarter, reflecting growth in completed M&A transactions. We ranked #1 in announced and completed global M&A for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We advised on nearly 400 transactions that closed during the year, representing approximately $1.2 trillion of deal volume. We also participated in announced transactions totaling nearly $1.3 trillion, which included over $450 billion from transactions below $5 billion in deal value, reflecting progress in broadening our client coverage.  Moving to Underwriting. Market volatility, declining equity prices and wider credit spreads weighed on issuer sentiment as net revenues were down 21% sequentially in the fourth quarter to $843 million. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.9 billion, up 7% from 2017 on increases in both Financial Advisory and Underwriting. For 2018, in addition to our leading advisory position, we held the #1 position in equity underwriting globally. We were #2 in high yield and #4 in investment grade, reflecting our multiyear commitment to build our debt underwriting franchise.  Our Investment Banking franchise overall remains very well positioned and continues to grow. The strong performance reflects our continued focus on building long-term client relationships and our ongoing investment in talent and capabilities. We are ending 2018 with an Investment Banking backlog meaningfully higher than where we finished 2017, notwithstanding a decline versus last quarter. This increase comes despite the robust revenue production of 2018. Turning to Institutional Client Services on Page 7. Net revenues were $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. That's despite higher volatility and a difficult market backdrop, particularly in FICC. For the full year, ICS generated $13.5 billion of net revenues, up 13% compared to 2017, driven by healthier volumes, better wallet share and improved execution in certain of our businesses, notably in commodities. FICC client execution net revenues were $822 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% versus 2017 amid challenging market conditions, particularly in credit and, to a lesser extent, in rates. Credit accounted for roughly 3/4 of the year-over-year decline. Results were impacted by a deteriorating environment in high-yield and distressed credit as spreads widened. Lower levels of liquidity further exacerbated the challenges. I would also note that there was no one particular position to call out as having a material effect.  The remaining decrease reflected lower results in rates while the other FICC businesses were relatively consistent with last year's performance. While the fourth quarter was challenging due to the market environment, the overall business improved in 2018. For the full year, FICC net revenues were $5.9 billion, representing 11% year-over-year growth. Importantly, we continue to seek improvement in FICC performance through our strategic initiatives. First, we successfully increased our wallet share by 65 basis points since 2016 with our institutional client base per coalition. However, this provided a minimal top line benefit so far given the market backdrop. Nevertheless, we continue to broaden our client and product footprint and deepen our relationships to drive higher rankings and market share.  Second, we remained focused on leveraging our best-in-class Investment Banking relationships to better serve corporate clients. Our efforts are beginning to yield results in commodities and foreign exchange. This is important as we are not relying on a market turn to yield better results, but are looking to expand our client footprint.  Lastly, we remained focused on continued investments in engineering and electronification. The enhancements of platforms and processes will allow us to better serve our clients and further streamline expenses and capital. Our new platforms enable us to innovate at a faster pace, scale our businesses and deliver differentiated client-centric solutions to our institutional and corporate clients. To demonstrate the momentum we see, revenues in our FICC electronic business were up more than 40% last year. Moving to Page 8. In Equities, as it relates to the fourth quarter, the story is a better one. Net revenues were up $1.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Equities client execution net revenues were up significantly versus a challenged fourth quarter of 2017, with better performance in cash. Commissions and fees were 9% higher, attributable to increased client activity, following the significant uptick in volatility, particularly in low touch where we continue to gain market share. Security services net revenues decreased slightly, reflecting lower average customer balances.  For 2018, Equities produced net revenues of $7.6 billion, up 15% year-over-year. During the year, we continued to benefit from industry consolidation and ongoing efforts to increase client connectivity. Our share of global equity market volumes increased by over 100 basis points versus 2017 and included growth across all regions, reflecting a multiyear positive trend. We are optimistic that the theme of consolidation to scale providers can continue into 2019 as MiFID II only went live 12 months ago. Moving on to equity Investing & Lending on Page 9. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1 billion in the quarter, reflecting continued strong results in private equity investments. Approximately 1/2 of the net revenues were generated from real estate, which primarily reflected gains from sales. For the full year, equity Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $4.5 billion. Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across geography and investment vintage as seen on the slide. We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance, with 47% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last 4 years. The equity balance sheet ended the quarter at $21.4 billion, including a public portfolio of $1.4 billion and $20 billion of private equity. Revenues in equity I&L are also generated from our CIE investments of $13 billion, substantially all in real estate.  Moving on to debt Investing & Lending on Page 10. In the fourth quarter, net revenues from debt securities and loans were $912 million, largely driven by net interest income of roughly $800 million. For the full year, debt Investing & Lending generated $3.8 billion of net revenues, including net interest income of approximately $2.7 billion. I would point out that before accounting for future growth, we begin 2019 with an annualized net interest income run rate of $3.2 billion. Our debt Investing & Lending balance sheet, as shown on the lower left of Page 10, ended the quarter at $113 billion, which includes $94 billion in loans and $11 billion in debt securities. Our lending is franchise adjacent and continues to remain conservative with approximately 85% of our loan portfolio secured as of year-end. This quarter, we took provision for loan losses of $222 million, reflecting loan growth. Turning to Investment Management on Page 11. The business produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, which were flat sequentially. Management and other fees were $1.4 billion; incentive fees were $153 million; and transaction revenues were $186 million. For the full year 2018, Investment Management net revenues were a record $7 billion, up 13% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in incentive fees and management and other fees. Assets under supervision finished 2018 at $1.54 trillion. For the full year, assets under supervision increased $48 billion resulting from $37 billion of long-term net inflows primarily in fixed income and equity assets and $52 billion of net inflows into liquidity products. Those were offset by net market depreciation of $41 billion primarily in equity. Over the trailing 5 years, we attracted total cumulative organic long-term net inflows of approximately $215 billion. The business remains well positioned for growth as we continue to invest in people and make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance our product offering to better serve our clients.  Now let me turn to Page 12 for expenses. As we continued to invest in our businesses, we will not lose focus on our expense discipline. It remains a priority for David, John and me. Before going through the details, I'll reiterate that we are undertaking a full review of our firm-wide expense base. Relatedly, and as part of the front-to-back reviews, we are holding businesses to a higher level of accountability with a focus on operating efficiency. For 2018, operating expenses were $23.5 billion, up 12%. Nonetheless, we maintained a stable efficiency ratio of approximately 64% as revenue growth funded investments in our business.  Let me take you through the components of our operating expenses. Compensation and benefits expense was up 6% for 2018, amounting to half the rate of growth in revenues. This translated into a compensation and net revenues ratio of 33.7%, down 190 basis points versus 2017. On a like-for-like basis, our compensation ratio declined approximately 100 basis points year-over-year. Fourth quarter other operating expenses were $3.3 billion, which, as I mentioned earlier, included litigation expense of $516 million as well as a donation of $132 million to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable fund. For the full year, other operating expenses rose 20%, and roughly half of the increase related to client activity and investments for growth. This included an increase of $656 million in provisions related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, approximately $300 million of higher expenses relating to accounting changes due to the revenue recognition standard. But substantially all of the remaining increase of $892 million from investments to drive growth and higher activity reflected in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.  Moving on to taxes. As mentioned earlier, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%. Based on our current interpretations of the rules and legislative guidance to date, we expect our 2019 tax rate to be between 22% and 23%, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation.  Turning to Page 13 on Capital. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.3% using the standardized approach and 13.1% under the advanced approach, up 20 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively, versus the third quarter. The improvement in the advanced ratio reflected 80 basis points related to lower credit risk weighted assets due to inclusion of the firm's default experience into the determination of probability of default calculation. Our supplementing leverage ratio finished at 6.2%.  For the full year, we repurchased 13.9 million shares of common stock worth $3.3 billion, contributing to a reduction in our basic share count of 8 million shares for the year, reaching a record new low. In addition, we paid out approximately $1.2 billion of common dividends over the course of the year. In total, we returned $4.5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2018.  Turning to balance sheet and liquidity on Page 14. Our global core liquid assets averaged $229 billion during the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet was $933 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. We continue to shift our funding mix from unsecured long-term debt to deposits. In our consumer deposits business, we have raised over $35 billion, including nearly $7 billion in the U.K. Raising incremental consumer deposits continues to benefit the firm through increased funding diversification, lower financing costs and capacity to increase business in our bank subsidiaries. For example, in addition to carrying out the vast majority of the firm's lending business, GS Bank USA conducts rates, an increasing component of our FX business.  Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We entered 2019 well positioned despite the recent market volatility. We remain committed to serving and growing our global client franchise, building on the progress made in 2018 and further expanding our addressable market in 2019 and beyond. To achieve this, we continue to invest in our franchise to broaden and improve our client capabilities through technology, talent and by engaging in new disruptive activities. Lastly, the management team is motivated by the initial learnings from our front-to-back reviews. Our early work indicates the need for certain change, but also reinforces the strength and breadth of our franchise. We will share more with you in the coming months. The continued push to evolve our businesses will enable us to grow and deliver attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.  With that, thanks again for dialing in, and we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : And I want to talk about I&L. And it's a combo of -- in equity, I heard your comments about the public piece is a small piece, and I heard your comments about realizations were half from real estate or half of it was from real estate realizations. But curious if you can remind us how markets work in the private piece because, obviously, the public markets were down a lot, how much you use on DCF cash flow, EBITDA growth versus public comps? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks, Glenn. I appreciate the question. So in the I&L space, and I'll focus on the equity side as that's in your question, the private portfolio obviously is now a much larger component of the whole relative to public securities. And when we look at valuation in that private portfolio, I would tell you that on a revenue basis in the private portfolio, about 50% of that revenue comes from events relating to the underlying companies and 50% relates to the operational progress in that particular business. And I'll just give you a couple of examples just to give you a sense of it. So if you look over the course of 2018 in the private portfolio, we saw sales across a number of different names : Hearthside Foods, Ipreo, PSAV, Paycor, Centaur Gaming. All of those were either sales or partial sales. And together, those five names contributed to more than $500 million of revenue in the overall results of the firm. I'd also point out that in the context of events that play out, obviously, those are sales or partial sales, but there are other situations in which there are incremental rounds of equity that comes in to a particular name, where there's other financing that goes on around a name. Two names that I'll point out, which were significant contributors to the P&L in the I&L side on equity was Woowa, which is a Korean investment; and a name you'll no doubt know, which was Uber, as there were a -- there was a transaction in the tender into SoftBank into which we and others participated. And that, too, contributed to an uplift in the P&L relating to that name. So the point I want to convey to you is that much of what happens in the context and 50% of the P&L on that private portfolio is not related to modeling per se but rather is generated off of an event, an observable event that goes on. The other half relates to general performance of the business. And on that, as you could imagine, we deploy a number of different metrics in terms of how we arrive at valuation. But I think the important element to convey on that side is that there's a long history in the investing side, particularly in equity, in both sourcing interesting and sometimes unique opportunities for businesses that demonstrate stability and growth trajectory. And that performance feeds into the methodology we deploy against the private portfolio. And again, this is independent of event-driven situations themselves. Glenn Schorr : Okay. That's all very helpful, and it sets up for my follow-up on -- but I love the idea of the opening up of I&L. I'm curious in the vintage disclosure, it's hard to tell. But have you done any big raises in any of the prime funds in the last year or 2? And then more importantly, where are you in the process? In other words, I love the concept, house performance. Do you need to add staff? Do you need to build out on distribution? Or is it as simple as get your docs order and put out a new fund? David Solomon : So I'll start, Glenn, and I'll just comment. Obviously, we've been in these businesses for a long time. And as I know you appreciate, there's been an evolving multiple businesses, and there's also been an evolving regulatory front that let us down certain paths with respect to the businesses. We do raise funds, and we have gone back in, for example, our traditional merchant banking private equity business to raising a fund. In the last 18 months, we raised an $8 billion or $9 billion fund. That's called Goldman Sachs Capital Partners VII, which is pretty much all client money. We have a plan, a current plan that raises -- and has a number of fundraisers over the course of the next couple of years. That's an existing plan, and it's something we've been doing. What we've identified that we think is a real opportunity given the scope of the magnitude of all the platforms over the firm is to add some resources and broaden the plan to raise more money off the capital given the uniqueness of our platforms and the uniqueness of our sourcing capability. And when you look at that opportunity and you compare what would be significant growth for us compared to other people that are in that business given our platform, our investing resources and our capability to manage money for institutional and individual clients, we have meaningful growth without setting overly ambitious targets. So we are in the process of outlining that all in a much more clear way. There will be some hiring and additional resources that need to be added, but it's not a significant build because the fundamental investing platforms exist, and there's more opportunity to leverage that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Stephen, maybe one more, just on the I&L business. It's obviously one that's tough to predict. But when I think about some of the sales that you mentioned and how that drove the benefit in the quarter, can you give us any kind of color or indication of maybe what the value is in the portfolio versus, like, the cost base? Just to get some sense on maybe what the potential, like, realizations as you have these sales over the next year or 2 could potentially be? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think it's difficult for me to give you a sense of the delta in the [Technical Difficulty] relative to where we carry it. I would ask you to sort of rely more on the progression and the stability and sustainability of this business just in terms of what it has produced for many, many quarters over several years in the context of the investing. And I think that the strength of that franchise and the strength of the investing is sort of an adjacent thread that runs across the whole of the firm, which is that the Investment Banking franchise is an extraordinary sourcing engine off of which we look to make these investments. And we try to find opportunities where there is considerable opportunity for growth. What I sense in your question is the sort of distinction, if you will, between realized and unrealized gain. Part of what I wanted to point out in answering the prior question is that there's a good deal here of realized gain in the book and a continual velocity turn in the portfolio, and sales or partial sales sort of are one part of that. And then looking at the performance of the business is quite another. David and I have committed ourselves, and I've said this now several times, that our ambition is to put more light into the I&L segment, just given what it produces and how it is a major component piece. I know that you asked on the equity side. Let me just spend 2 seconds on the debt side of I&L, which I think has even greater durability and predictability to it. So this is where we are making debt investments or expanding credit in and around the adjacencies of the firm, whether it's the corporates or others who are themselves clients of the firm. We're doing that high up in the capital structure, and we've developed a portfolio that is about 85% secured. And that has thrown up, as I said in my comments, about $2.7 billion of net interest income, with a run rate exiting Q4 of about $800 million in the quarter. And we think that's part of a more durable, more visible, more recurring set of revenue as part of the overall I&L picture itself. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just as a follow-up. Just on the expense side. So obviously 2018, I think you got some moving pieces with the -- some of the legal. But just when you think about some of the investments that you guys have been making in some of the new growth initiatives on the technology side, how should we be thinking about the run rate going into '19 and '20 in an environment where obviously the market has been a bit more volatile more recently? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So let me make one sort of opening comment on expenses generally and these investments. We are very cognizant of where we on the market, volatility in the market and the like. And we will be mindful of the pace of our investment spend and the cadence of it in the context of the market. We know where our priorities lie. And as into the extent the market changes or circumstances change, we know where there are levers to sort of throttle back if, in fact, we need to. So that whole investment cadence, if you will, can remain very agile, and we'll be mindful of it. If you look at '18, we had an increase in overall expenses of about $2.5 billion. About $700 million of that related to compensation, $1.8 billion related to noncomp. Again, in the noncomp, about half of that related to higher provisions for litigation and rev rec, which sort of isolates in on about $892 million of increase in spend relating to investments that we view as driving growth and higher activity in BC&E. All of the investment spend in the different projects that David and I have been talking about, whether that's in Marcus or whether that's corporate cash management or whether that's the building incremental platforms inside the securities and trading business, is in that $892 million. As I said, 2019 will be a continuation of the investment. My view is that the rate of growth in that expense, while it will grow, the rate of growth will be less than the rate of growth that we saw in '18, and we're going to continue to look to deploy existing operating leverage in the business as a source of that investment spend in the business overall. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Chinedu Bolu : David, maybe just stepping back a little bit here. Curious what you think will drive superior long-term shareholder returns. I think over the last two years, the firm has actually executed pretty well. You delivered better than peer revenue growth, better than peer core ROEs. Despite that and put into their side, the stock has underperformed even before the 1MDB issues. So what changes going forward? Is there some reason you think the market will finally start to give the stock credit for revenue growth at ROE? Or are there just other metrics you should be focused on to drive shareholder returns? David Solomon : Sure, and I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're cognizant of the way the market is looking at our business mix, and we're also cognizant of the performance of the stock. It's very hard for me to predict, and I won't try to predict when the market will recognize our returns and our progress, but it's our job to stay focused on delivering those returns for shareholders. And over time, if we do, I'm confident that we'll be balanced in an appropriate way. We've been very focused for a number of years on diversifying the platform and moving forward. I do want to say, just to put in context and to highlight maybe in a different way, some of the progress we've made. And many of you obviously have been following the company for a long time.  If 3 to 5 years ago, we said on one of these calls that in 2018, we would have a year where our FICC ICS revenues were less than $6 billion, we were making significant investments in building out a digital consumer platform and we happened to be in a situation where we had [indiscernible] litigation expense that we would deliver $36.6 billion of revenues and a 13.3% return, people would have said, not possible. And the reason that that's happened is we have been working for a number of years to broaden our business, expand our addressable wallet and, at the same point in time, increase the durability of our revenues. And you can see from the slide that we put up at the beginning that over the last x number of years, 5 years, we've moved from less than 50% more fee-based recurring revenues to over 60% today. We continue to be committed to that. And as we're developing a plan to move forward, we see things we can do in the existing businesses and adjacent build, some of which we mentioned, where we feel very confidently that we can continue to push returns higher, especially if we also continue to be focused on running the firm more efficiently, which as Stephen stated, we're very committed to doing. So I think we're in a position where we have opportunities to continue on this path that we've been on. I think one of the things candidly that we need to continue to do better, and I hope you see through this call we are committed to doing, is we need to do a better job giving you information and explaining what we are, what we do, how we do it. I think we're making progress. But I think candidly, we have work to do, and we're going to continue to remain focused on that. And we hope over time, if our focus on expanding the business and diversifying the business while staying true and excellent in the things that have always been core to the business while communicating better, ultimately, the market will follow. And so that's what we're going to stick to and do. Chinedu Bolu : I appreciate the candor, and what I sense is a sense of urgency in your voice. On FICC, you talked about optimizing the business. So just help us level set here kind of what are the margins or ROEs in the business today. What can you exactly do to help that business get to an ROE that's closer to the firm-wide ROE? And then on FICC top line, I guess if increasing electronic volumes and improving wallet share aren't driving material revenue growth or material revenue share growth, what do you think will actually drive revenue share growth going forward? David Solomon : Okay. So I'm going to start, Christian, by making a couple of comments, and then Stephen will go into, I think, a little bit more detail on some of the specifics that you mentioned. But I just want to start by saying that I really like our FICC business. It's a really big, important business. But we're not confused by the fact that the available wallet in market intermediation for large institutions has materially declined over the course of the last five years. One of the things that's been interesting for me over the last two years once I became president and I started spending more time with the broader diverse array of our clients, I'd always go out for the last decade, more than a decade, and see Investment Banking clients. And they always told me how extraordinary they thought are people were, the way our teams work together, the way the executed. As I've had an opportunity over the last two years to go out and spend a lot of time with Securities division clients and with clients of Fixed Income, they say exactly the same thing. Your people are really differentiated. Your risk takers and the capability is really differentiated.  Your execution is really differentiated. We have a very, very strong client franchise business, but's it's in a business where there's been fundamental change and wallet change. I would highlight that if you go back and look at our wallet market shares before the financial crisis in 2005, '06 and '07, our wallet shares were in the 8%, 8.5% range. And if you look at our wallet shares today, our wallet shares are around 12%. And so there was an aberration during the 2009 kind of period where the wallet shares peaked, but we've continued to build this franchise, and we're laser focused on building it. The one thing that I said in my comments that I just want to reiterate is we accept the size of the wallet share that exists, and it's our job to run the business well based on that wallet share to allocate capital over time efficiently and to run that business in an effective way from a cost perspective, and we continue to do that while continuing to invest in the client franchise. And so Stephen, I think, will make some comments to add on some of the more specific detailed parts of the question. Stephen Scherr : Christian, so just to pivot off of David's comments. I mean, I think the objective here is to identify the appropriate TAM. I mean, what's the addressable market that we're playing for? And you are absolutely right to point out that our increased market share, and David was referring to it, among institutional clients has not, in the last couple of years, demonstrated revenue conversion. And so part of that is moving us in a direction to expand our corporate coverage and corporate touch point as it relates to the FICC, and that's using channels that exist and relationships that exist in Investment Banking. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen modest improvement in that, particularly in commodities and foreign exchange. And it's against that addressable market that we're going to take and are taking in part of -- as part of the front to back of U.S. to the proper expense size against that wallet and against that TAM, the amount of debt and liquidity we need to put against that business, the amount of risk that we need to take on in the context of intermediating risk for clients and then, ultimately, the amount of capital to put against it. This is not something that David and I have just woken up to. In fact, if you look at over the last several years, 3 to 5 years, there has been a lot of work on going inside the business to reduce expenses by about 30% in that period, reduce RWAs by about 40% in that period. And most importantly, an active and engaged move to reallocate capital around the firm, moving it away from a smaller business in FICC and putting it against Investment Banking or other businesses around the firm. And so while we have not sort of put as much headline to a lot of that activity as perhaps some of the other institutions, this is an evolutionary process that we've begun. It now has a greater sense of urgency and purpose in the context in which David described it, and I think we have a clear view, along with those running the business, about how to get to the right place and the right size of input allocation to the business itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski : First of all, before I ask my question, I just want to say I think it really does serve shareholders very well that you're doing this new, more fulsome strategic review and outlook. So I just want to thank you, I guess, on behalf of everybody for that. It's very useful to see. David Solomon : Thank you, Guy. I appreciate that. Stephen Scherr : Thanks for the feedback. Guy Moszkowski : Yes, no worries. So I just want to follow up on Christian's questions on FICC. I was hoping maybe you could quantify for us the capital reallocation and the expense reallocation that you alluded to both in your prepared remarks and also in answering his question. Stephen Scherr : Yes. I mean, I think the quantification that I can give you is really sort of part of what I was responding to in terms of Christian's question, which is in the last five years, as I said, we've taken expense down 30%, RWAs by 40% and reallocation of capital. I think my hope and my expectation is that David and I will be back to you over the course of the next several months with a very clear indication about the specific allocation of resources. And I'm not hesitating other than part of the front-to-back review that we are engaged in right now is to answer the very question you're asking, which is, again, understand the addressable market, including an expanded set of customers and clients that we will focus on and then being quite clear about what our taking that market can be and then the inputs to driving that business, whether it's expenses, liquidity, capital and otherwise. And my expectation is we'll be back to you with a clear view as to how that will take lift over time. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's helpful. And obviously, we'll be looking for that. Follow-up question is in a different direction and just follows up on the comments that you made about the 1MDB situation and the litigation reserve bill that you quantified. The -- I guess my question would be, can you give us a sense at this point as to about how much bigger your reasonable -- reasonably possible loss or RPL will be that we'll see in the 10-K? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So again, just to sort of be clear with folks as to what we said. So the fourth quarter litigation expense was $516 million. For the full year, we took litigation expense of $844 million. And as we sit here now, and so my comment on the RPL, which will obviously be disclosed in the K, now is premised only on what we know now and nothing more, so that could change. But based on what we know now, the RPL will be in the neighborhood of about $2 billion, independent of the reserves that I otherwise listed off for you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the optimization of capital. Should we expect it to be kind of moving from one area to another area of the firm? Or are you hoping to maybe free up some more capital for shareholder buybacks and dividends and things like that? Stephen Scherr : So I would say that there's a couple of variables in terms of the deployment of capital as a general matter. First, we obviously look at opportunities to deploy capital in accretive opportunities around growth initiatives, and so we'll continue to do that. And that is, in effect, redeploying capital from businesses that show less promise in terms of their overall return to those opportunities, both existing and new growth businesses, that show higher promise. Secondly, and I don't have to tell you, that there are limitations obviously to what we can do in terms of share buyback by virtue of CCAR, and we will continue to be as prudently aggressive as we can be in terms of the return of capital within the confines of CCAR. And obviously, we have yet to receive the scenario planning for this year, but that will factor in as best we can. And so I think that's the way to think about the deployment of capital, generally speaking. One, being an internal reallocation based on growth. But second, and in the growth sense, we want to invest in areas which will carry accretive returns for our shareholders and that can grow. And so our ambition and our MO will be just around that. Matthew O'Connor: And then maybe a question for David on the capital theme still. You're clearly reviewing the businesses. You're looking to make the revenues more annuity-like than they've been. Is there something that you think you can accomplish organically? Or do you think it -- maybe it'll be supplemented by deals? And obviously, within deals, you've done some small bolt-on ones. But there does continue to be some questions, I think, among investors and analysts about the need for a bigger deal to help balance out the business. So maybe if you can just comment on your thoughts on that. David Solomon : Sure. So look, as you would expect us do, we'll look at all options to grow the franchise both organic or inorganic. We're extremely focused on the organic opportunities, and we actually think the plan we're developing, which is an organic plan, can drive to meaningfully higher returns over time. And the preference would always be to drive organic progress in the business. I've said to many of you in meetings I've had in with you individually, and I'd say it here, we'll look at inorganic opportunities. I think you'll continue to see a few smaller add-on opportunities across our businesses, particularly when you look at asset management and wealth management. But the bar for doing significant inorganic move is extremely high. And as someone who's been around M&A for a significant portion of my career, I know the bar to do that should be extremely high. But it's our job as a management team to be well-versed on any opportunity that we think can advance our returns and our cost for shareholders, and we'll operate that way as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with the Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : If I can try a 1MDB question. So how much of this is related to the U.S., like were the securities -- were any of the securities -- U.S. securities or any of the buyers in the U.S. or any of the transaction structure in the U.S.? And the reason I ask is to help determine whether or not the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 or 1934 apply? Stephen Scherr : Mike, thanks for the question. These securities were all reg S securities sold to non-U.S. buyers. And we're not structured in the U.S. nor under Reg S. We're destined to be sold to U.S. buyers. Michael Mayo : All right. That's helpful. And then a more general question. 1MDB certainly is in the news. There's been many articles talking about the morale of employees and the potential impact on customers. What is the spillover effect of 1MDB on customers, employees, business or any other way other than what's happening in the legal and regulatory realm? David Solomon : Sure, and I appreciate the question. Obviously, we think about this, and we monitor it carefully. First, I'll talk about employees first, and I think morale and the firm for employees is high. Employees feel good about the performance of the firm. They do not like the fact that we're dealing with the situation in 1MDB. And certainly, I think people here are extremely angry and upset about the fact that we had a partner of the firm involved in such a significant fraud. And as I said in my remarks, that's something that we have enormous regret about. But the business has performed well. I think people recognize that this is something that we're going through a deliberative process of resolving. But people feel good about the firm, our client franchise, the work they're doing with our clients and the way the firm's positioned. In terms of our clients, we obviously are extremely engaged with our clients and are talking to our clients on a regular basis, and I would say the impact on our client franchise at this point across the globe has been de minimis. I'm not, in any way, shape or form, not aware of all the noise in the press and all the articles. And I read them, I watch them as you do. And I, for a moment, would not say that the impact of this is a reputational dent to the firm that we have to and we'll work through. But that said, as we deal with clients and we stay focused on our clients, we're executing for them. And I think you also have to be cognizant of the fact that a lot of what gets in the press and where it comes from has motivations in the context of the resolution of what's a difficult process. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Question on the cash management business that you talked about at the beginning of the call, David. I just want to understand how much the investment is going into the technology side and how you're investing in the plant and equipment in terms of the banking licenses globally that you need in order to have this type of offering. Or do you partner with local banks? And then I have a follow-up just related to that and how you're thinking about the loan growth. Stephen Scherr : Sure, Betsy. It's Stephen. I'll take that. So in the context of corporate cash management, you'll remember that our interest in this was in part a view that when we look at sort of the most significant relationships that we had in Investment Banking across those corporates that they were paying a considerable amount to the market, almost equal to that, that they pay in the market in which we participate, namely our Advisory and Underwriting business, but they were paying in and around Treasury services and corporate cash management. And given that this had historically been kind of the problems of lending banks, the fact that we have picked up our lending and credit into these, sort of gave us an entry point for this conversation. I'd also say that what we perceived was a pain point among corporate treasuries that the technology and the platforms they were working with were underwhelming. And what's more, if you look at what banks have been paying on operational deposits, it's been de minimis. And so from our perspective, this is something where with a clean sheet of paper, we can build the technology, we can design it, edge your way to address those pain points. And candidly, from a competitive point of view, the operational deposits are quite attractive to us even if we pay rates well above that, which are being paid by other banks just in the context of substitution for wholesale funding. When you look at the technology that we're building, I would say that there's a certain element of it which is synergistic with other technology builds that we have been undertaking, including Marcus and including what we've been building and strengthening the legal equity of GS Bank US. So for example, the development of the payments hub, which is obviously central not just to what we do in the context of Marcus, but equally what we would do in terms of corporate cash management. This business has developed over the last 5 or 10 years in terms of the ability to make use of many, many vendors to build this in the cloud, to integrate those vendors in a way that would have required organic build inside the organization, in a way that's not necessary now. I think as we build this and as we grow this, we're going to be selective. And we won't be all things to all people out of the box. We will select certain currencies among the major currencies where we will play. There are interesting vendor solutions that can take you to secondary and tertiary markets, where you don't necessarily need to build correspondent banking relationships on as proliferated a basis as you had 2 years ago. And so we intend to do that, that way. And so I think the technology is at hand. It's the right time to be doing this, and I think we can execute this. I'd also point out, just as an aside, that the first customer of this platform, in fact, will be Goldman Sachs such that we can reduce the cost of our own operational deposits outside of the bank, and I think in the process, de-risk the firm from that perspective. Betsy Graseck : And when you think about how you get paid for this business, I mean, historically, in the industry, part of it has come from lending. So I just wanted to confirm if that's part of how you're expecting to get paid, but also how you think about the capital allocation to the loan book, not only in corporate, but in consumer. Awhile back, there was some commentary that maybe Marcus loan growth would be slowing. So if you can touch on that and also how you think about the balance sheet utilization towards loans versus towards buybacks. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So I just want to be clear. When we look at the P&L prospect and we model out what returns we can get, return on lending is not part of what we look at in the context of corporate cash management. I'll come back to your lending question. But in the context of corporate cash management, there are basically 3 components, okay? One, and the most significant, are operational deposits. They are useful to us. They're probably more useful as a substitute for wholesale funding. The second, which ties back to an adjacency into our securities business, is the captive FX that plays out in the context of corporate cash management more generally. And then the third, which candidly is probably the smallest of the three, is fee-for-service. When I was referring to lending, what I was pointing out was that for a long, long time, this was a business that was sort of exclusively in the province of lending institutions to corporates. Over time, we have grown our corporate lending book for reasons obviously unrelated to corporate cash management because it wasn't in the plan years ago but as part of what we've been doing strategically and growing and developing in terms of a broader set of products and relationships with corporates. That has been ongoing. That will continue to go on. It will go on with all of the attending risk issues and the like. But the P&L, if you will, that's generated from that lending, is not a motivating factor. It's just me pointing out to you that it had been, in effect, a gating item in a way in which corporate cash management had been thought about. And so we are a lender and a more prolific lender in that regard, and therefore, think we have more sort of access and right and title to sort of play and compete for this business. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Curious on Marcus deposits. We've heard here in the last few days a few banks commenting on the likelihood that we could see retail deposit costs increasing even if we don't see any short-term rate increases. If that plays out in 2019, could you maybe let us know how you would think about keeping your position competitively in the market at the upper end of that bound as far as payout goes, how you would adjust? Just how should we think about that as far the market deposits go? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So I think if you look historically from the time that we acquired the GE deposit platform in the U.S., I would say that the beta was lower than where it's going, meaning it'll remain lower than one, but in the rate environment in which we were in, it was very little by way of movement and rate. There's been more acceleration of rate in the context of where interest rates have been moving. Our objective in the U.S. has always have been -- has always been to be in the top kind of 2, 3 or 4 in the sort of tables as rate paid. And I would point out that while we're not particularly motivated to pay more than we need to, the draw on these deposits is obviously rate dependent. And even at levels well beyond that which we're currently paying, these remain very accretive sort of funding to the firm relative to where we fund on a like-for-like duration in the wholesale market. And I think the diversification overall that's brought to us by these retail deposits is positive. And so that's kind of the story on rate. In the U.K., I would say that we opened up to be perfectly candid with much more demand than we had anticipated, and I think that'll give us an ability to moderate sort of the acceleration of rate in that. And I think we were the beneficiaries of sort of hitting a nerve in the U.K. market where we were paying more than the high street banks, and deposits came our way. But the influx of that, I think, will give us more maneuverability on the rate side. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. I appreciate that. And then for my second question, while we've seen spreads net back and the loan market recover here, CLOs and levered loans became a big topic in the fourth quarter. So could you maybe let us know how you manage the risks of the warehouse? How much of your warehouse is funded with third-party equity? And if it is fully funded with third party, how you manage counterparty risk to those providers? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So that can go in a number of ways. I'll start by saying that our CLO exposure is small. It's in the neighborhood of about $2 billion, about half of that is funded. If you look more broadly at our risk exposure in terms of leverage lending and the like, it remained small on relative terms. If you look at our underwriting book, our underwriting book skews heavily toward investment grade. And if you look at LBO risk, it's single digit in terms of where it sits and appreciably lower than where it was certainly if you go back to the financial crisis itself. And so we feel very good about our risk. I would say that we come into '19. And as I and others from a risk perspective look at the book, we feel comfortable at the flex that we have in our underwriting commitments. We are pleased at sort of the underwriting concessions. We're seeing flow of funds back into bond funds and loan funds, took a turn into January relative to the outflows that we saw in December. We're seeing investment-grade deals move. We're seeing caps in the term. So all of the, if you will, indicators on the dashboard are playing more favorably than what we've seen in the past, and I think we're very, very comfortable in terms of where we are in overall risk. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start off with a question on some of the efficiency commentary. And I have to say I was quite encouraged by the remarks really from both of you, Stephen and David, on focused driving efficiency, the higher accountability from the individual teams. And one of the interesting things that's been a big focus from investors is when we benchmark your efficiency ratio against the peers and really focusing in on the businesses that are comparable. The efficiency ratio range for the peers sets about 55% to 70%. It looks like you shook out somewhere closer to 64%, so already closer to that midpoint. And I'm just wondering how -- whether you can give us some insight to how you're thinking about long-term efficiency goals, really how you're benchmarking yourself across the peers as you continue to drive that focus on efficiency across the individual teams. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So thanks for the question and for the comment. I mean, our view on efficiency ratio and the migration there is that we need to look across all expenses, particularly as we're building out sort of more platform-driven businesses, which will be less compensation, if you will, expense intensive and more operationally intensive. And obviously, the marginal margin as you build scale around those will increase, and so hence, our turn in that direction. I would point out that if you look at the efficiency ratio, we report a number which is flat year-on-year, again notwithstanding growth and expense of 12%. But equally, litigation reserves in that number took that number in a direction where it would have been about 230 basis points lower in terms of the efficiency ratio than where we reported it. I'm not suggesting that what we reported is anything but correct, but just to give you a sense of the migration. It's hard to know right now and to give you a sense of what the forward target would be. I think over time, you should expect us based on the revenue -- the durable revenue that David was talking about and recurring revenue on the basis of platform that we will extract greater efficiency in the business as the business skews in that direction and as we run through this front to back. And in the coming months as we meet and sit with more of you, my hope is that we can guide you, directionally speaking, to where this will go. But the downward trend is one that we hope to continue to realize. Steven Chubak : Stephen, those insights are quite helpful. Just one follow-up as it relates to some of your comments on the marginal margin improving, and I know it was a little more than a year ago when you initially laid out those growth targets on the revenue side of $5 billion. You had talked about a marginal margin of 50%. Clearly, that's required some frontloading of investment. But I'm wondering with about half of the incremental revenue growth still ahead of us, how we should think about that incremental margin on the next $2.5 billion of revenue growth that [Technical Difficulty]. Stephen Scherr : [Technical Difficulty] example of that is in any lending business, when you are in a growth mode, you continue to have reserve build right to the point at which you are at a comfortable, steady state. And from there, you start to see the margin increase. And so I think that each of these businesses, whether it's corporate cash management or Marcus, are all in their early stages. They haven't yet hit their stride, notwithstanding our expectation that they'll hit the targets we set for them in 2020. Those targets were, by no means, a limit of where we think we can take the firm in terms of the overall growth trajectory generally. I would also say that the commentary on efficiency and higher marginal margin should not be limited exclusively to kind of the growth initiatives themselves. So look at FICC, for example. FICC over time, and David was talking about this, there's an element of platform electronification as a means of which you can drive higher volumes in a narrowing a bid-offer spread. And I think even there, as we progress the initiative to build out those platforms, we'll realize greater margin. Again, that's an incumbent business. So the commentary is not limited to those on the growth side. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Maybe a strategy question in retail. I always think of Goldman's core competency is creating wealth management, and you kind of led with retail banking. And just -- I appreciate the comments on starting to build out a digital wealth. Have you thought -- or is it in your plans to think about also building out more of a complete brokerage platform as well to kind of leverage your gain throughput through your institutional platform? David Solomon : So as we talked about, as we think about Marcus and we think about Marcus as it started with one plan -- with one product. Our plan has always been to build a platform, and that platform would be digital, and it would be a storefront over which we could distribute multiple products, some products that we originate and come off our platform, some products maybe that we distribute for others. There's always been a focus on the fact that we have a massive wealth management business at the very, very high end. And we've always shied away from broadening that footprint or making it more retail, for another lack of term, because the only way you could do that previously was to basically own a big brokerage. And there were a lot of reasons why we didn't think, for us, that owning a big brokerage was something that we wanted to do as we thought strategically going forward about where the firm would go. But now with a digital platform, we have opportunities to acquire clients and feed clients into our platform on a much more effective cost of customer acquisition basis. And so our vision is to continue to build out that platform and add more products and more connectivity into our wealth management business over time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. I guess, first question here, you gave a little bit of a preview, so I'm just going to ask another one on the front-to-back review. I think it's largely been viewed as kind of a net cost-cutting capital reduction exercise. But on the other side of that, do you have any early reads on what specific existing businesses look like they might deserve more investment or more capital than maybe you previously realized? And just so that we know, is this going to come with first quarter results? Or when should we expect this? David Solomon : Sure. So first, obviously when you want a front to back and you look at your businesses, there's an element of cost-cutting and capital allocation. But the real purpose of looking at businesses front to back, the starting fundamental purpose is to understand your addressable market and the opportunity set and then with your resources to figure out the most effective way to deliver on it. So I want to be very, very clear. As any new management team would do in any large company, as they start down the path of evolving a strategy, you really want to look at the opportunity you have in businesses and then your ability to deliver on those opportunities. And so at a high level, the purpose of the front to back was both opportunity and then also efficiency, as you highlight. Stephen has a couple of other comments just with respect to kind of the detail. Stephen Scherr : Well, I would just point out, I think that this is going to cascade down in the organization, meaning our ambition is to put more of the costs in the direct control of the businesses so that they are owning the front to back. In effect, they ought to own their pretax line, meaning they're owning both their revenue line and the cost base. Now I should point out that we will keep certain functions in at the core, as you would expect us do from a control and risk point of view. So there'll be elements of ops and elements of tech that are held at the core. And needless to say, second and third line of control remain at the core. But we're looking to sort of put costs into the control hand of the business and driving businesses to a greater efficiency proposition in terms of how they conduct themselves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- and I apologize if you have addressed this. But what impact do you think the MiFID changes has had on your equity business? Obviously, you had good numbers this quarter, year-over-year growth as did some of the large -- your large competitors. Can you give us some color? We're 12 months into it, what have you guys seen from the changes with MiFID II? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So what we have seen from MiFID II is really market share consolidation, and it's played out at one level by geography and then another level in terms of individual firms. So we've seen more share consolidate, and that consolidated share move out of certain of the European banks and into the U.S. banks in terms of share of equities. And then within that, it's become kind of a tight game of which, needless to say, we are a major player. And so our expectation is that we're going to continue to see that consolidation. My hope is that we continue to benefit from that share consolidation. And I think we do so in part because we've developed over many years, and we'll continue, research platforms and high-value content that we can play out. And the share comes back to us in -- as a consequence. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Okay. Since there are no more questions, we would like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day, and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm happy to be here with all of you. Let me begin on Page 2. We reported first quarter 2019 revenues of $8.8 billion, down 13% versus last year, reflecting a slower start to the year relative to the robust market backdrop of a year ago. Net earnings were $2.3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $5.71. We posted return on common equity of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. While we aspire to deliver stronger results, the overall franchise performed well in the context of more muted market activity in the first half of the quarter. Through Friday, we ranked number one in global completed M&A, number one in announced M&A and number one in global equity underwriting. We posted record net interest income and debt investing and lending and record assets under supervision and investment management. Turning to Page 3, our results were generated in a mixed macroeconomic backdrop, particularly early in the quarter as a number of variables weighed on market sentiment. First coming up the challenging market performance in the fourth quarter, we saw central banks pivot to an accommodative policy on rate. In the U.S., the Fed shifted from its prior path of incremental tightening to a more neutral stance. In Europe, the ECB signaled move back monetary stimulus. Central banks in Asia also shifted to more dovish rhetoric amid a backdrop of low inflation and somewhat disappointing growth. The net result was a lower volatility environment as government bonds rallied and yield curves flattened in the U.S. and Europe. With the VIX and other measures of volatility at near record lows trading activity remained low. Second, we saw a significant slowdown in IPO activity as a direct result of the government shutdown, which weighed on sentiment and kept issuers and investors on the sidelines. Despite the rebound in equity and credit markets, we saw lower client conviction. Third, ongoing geopolitical risks, including the U.S. China trade and Brexit negotiations added uncertainty. Notwithstanding the mixed backdrop, resilient macro fundamentals and rising asset prices spurred client engagement later in the quarter. Our institutional investing clients appeared less cautious in March. And as we engaged with corporate clients around the world, we continue to hear a strong desire to execute strategic transactions and access the capital markets while the economy is growing, market prices are favorable and financing markets are open. Our backlog for IPO activity is robust. In that vein, we are optimistic on the forward as underlying indicators remain encouraging, and we're still very early in the second quarter. On Page 4, let me give you an update on our strategic planning. Stephen will provide further context in a moment when he shares some initial takeaways from our front to back reviews. To drive long-term shareholder value, our strategy sets up three primary objectives; first, we aim to strengthen our existing businesses; second, we aim to diversify our business mix with new services to expand our opportunity set and increase the durability of our revenues; and third, we aim to operate more efficiently and effectively across all aspects, including expenses, financing and capital. To achieve these objectives, we will endeavor to deliver one-Goldman Sachs to our clients; we will focus on growth where there is an adjacency to our existing businesses; we will expand our addressable market to deliver more products to existing and new clients; and we will pursue this expansion, via investments in talent, technology and platforms, all the while our emphasis will be on transparency with our stakeholders. As we seek to achieve our overarching goal of delivering superior products and services to our clients, we also look to leverage our spirit of innovation, our strength in engineering and our deep culture of risk management. Our ability to approach problems creatively and our willingness to adapt have served us well over our 150 year history. Turning to Page 5. Last month, we announced an important partnership with Apple, a leader in innovation and consumer technology with whom we are taking an important new step, our first credit card. Quite a lot has been said and written about this announcement and we will be able to talk more about Apple card once the product has launched. We're excited about the opportunity and expect it will prove to be differentiated in the marketplace and create incremental value for the firm over time. But importantly, I want to turn your attention to the key elements of this project as they represent the same drivers and underscore a range of major strategic growth initiatives underway at the firm. These elements include re-imagined products that address pain-points for corporations, institutions and consumers; new technology unburdened by legacy systems that often slowdown innovation; digital delivery mechanisms that produce scale and efficiency and access to large customer population. These elements are critical to our key growth platforms, including Marcus and mass affluent wealth where we will pursue partnerships to access large numbers of consumers; Marquee, our digital institutional platform where the ability to innovate can help us engage at scale with our institutional client base; and corporate cash management, where we can serve existing clients to the firm and offer differentiated products on a digital platform. With the incredible focus and energy of the people at Goldman Sachs, our strategy is beginning to take hold. We are on an evolutionary path. Our new investments will generate results over time, and will be complementary to our long-standing core business, which we will continue to strengthen. Ultimately, we believe the strategy will allow us to serve more clients with differentiated products and services, increase the durability and predictability of our earnings profile, deliver improved profitability, optimize our capital and deliver higher long-term returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Stephen to give you some additional details and walk through the results in each of our businesses. Stephen Scherr : Thanks David. Let me begin on Page 6, and frame our front to back reviews in the context of the strategy David just outlined. Last fall, as you know, we began a process of re-underwriting each of our businesses, including the development of three year plans for the firm. We're conducting broad and deep reviews. Our cadence and approach remain deliberate; no business, no revenue source, no capital or resources out of scope. And this requires us to take a thorough and extensive approach. FIC is of particular focus. And to that end, we are advancing a plan to enable FIC to improve its returns. The same is true across all businesses as we prioritize our investments to maximize shareholder returns. On the revenue side of the analysis, we are assessing opportunities to grow our addressable market, enhance client experience and grow wallet share. In terms of resources, we are diversifying our funding mix and optimizing our financial resources, including capital and liquidity. Let me be clear. Our efforts are not designed as a cost-cutting exercise, which we could accomplish quickly. Instead, this is an effort to invest in talent, technology, platforms and straight through processing to drive new sources of revenue, improve efficiency and drive higher margins. Embedded in this effort is a clear goal to improve the client experience with Goldman Sachs, from the sales interaction through execution, processing and ongoing service. Enhancing the client journey will drive higher engagement and increase opportunities across the entire organization. These improvements will take some time to realize, but should ultimately create significant operating leverage for the firm and long-term value for shareholders. Turning to Page 7. Let me be more specific in terms of the initiatives in both our existing and growth businesses. In Investment Banking, an important outcome of our review is our decision to further expand our client coverage universe. We first launched this effort in 2017 and we have since hired over 40 bankers, adding coverage for over 1,000 new clients, thereby increasing our footprint by about 10%. Given our early success, we have decided to expand the strategy. We are creating a specialized team within Investment Banking to serve new clients with enterprise values of less than $2 billion. We are looking to dedicate roughly 100 coverage bankers to this over time, increasing our capacity to cover thousands more clients. This effort will allow us to provide unparalleled strategic advice to more clients, while helping us maintain close attention to our existing clients. In that regard, our new corporate cash management platform build is advancing. We are excited for this opportunity as it opens us up to a very large revenue pool, including an estimated $5 trillion of corporate deposits in the U.S. alone. We will provide innovative technology to differentiate our offering to clients. For our franchise, there is significant value in serving these clients, including lower deposit funding costs and additional foreign exchange revenues. Once operational later this year, our firm will be the first to use this service, which will save us nearly $100 million per year and reduce operational risk. We are on target to launch the product with clients in 2020. Lastly, these efforts will help us to better serve corporate clients across the firm, including in adjacent areas like ICS and investment management. Next, in our institutional client services business, we identified a number of opportunities to better serve our existing client franchise and broaden our business mix. Across FIC and Equities, we are working to deepen our penetration with institutional and corporate clients, rural financing and increase our business with systematic investors. We are investing in platforms like Marquee to serve clients in new and more efficient ways. Marquee is our digital store front where our institutional and corporate clients consume GS content, risk analytics, pricing data and ultimately engage with us to trade. Every month, our platform logs over 14,000 unique users and fuels over 100 million API calls, including 10 million calls from clients from GS developer site. As we go forward, we expect significant increases in client utilization, which carries the potential to generate revenue across a more engaged client base. As I mentioned, we are spending a significant amount of time on FIC, with a focus on growing revenues across each of our core businesses. While we may adjust our focus and footprint in some of these areas, we remain committed to serving our clients at scale. On this point, let me share some further insight. We have been closely reviewing our footprint in commodities, and we remain committed to business. We are excited about the opportunity to further integrate our FIC and Investment Banking franchises to support corporate clients who need expertise and financing solutions. However, our reviews have identified opportunities to cut expenses and capital from certain underperforming parts of the commodities business and increase investments in others. We have already taken many of these actions and expect to continue to make refinements overtime. In credit where synergies with Investment Banking facilitate our high rankings in both trading and underwriting, we are building models and tools to facilitate faster inventory turnover and reduce drawdown risk as we execute client flows. Finally, through our one-Goldman Sachs initiative, we aim to shift focus away from per trade returns, taking a more holistic approach to client relationships. We anticipate FIC's flow activity will be a beneficiary of this approach. Next, turning to our investment and lending segment. We're keen to leverage our best-in-class alternative investment platform, track record and the unique sourcing capability of the firm. We will seek to manage larger pools of client assets to drive more recurring fee based revenues. Given the strength of our investing teams, we believe this effort can bear fruit with limited incremental spend. This will be a transition. We will be prudent and patience as reduce our on balance sheet investing activities and bring on more client money. Overtime, this will be early accretion and drive lower earnings volatility for the firm. Separately, we intend to continue supporting our clients through prudent franchise adjacent lending that helps increase recurring net interest income and deepen client relationships. To facilitate this, we will continue to tap into the large addressable market of consumer deposits. We estimate there are over $4 trillion of consumer deposited in the U.S. that are potential customers for online savings account like those offered by Marcus. Today, across both the U.S. and UK, we have $46 billion of online retail deposits, leaving a tremendous opportunity for growth and we will design our deposit platforms to capture our share. Pivoting to investment management, we continue to grow assets under supervision in key strategic areas, including advisory, outsource CIO and ETFs, as well as in our world-class ultrahigh network business where we have modest share in a very fragmented market. As I mentioned, alternatives is a key focus where client demand remains very strong with over $1.5 trillion of capital raised industry wide in the past five years. We currently have over $170 billion in alternative assets under supervision, and plan to significantly increase fundraising in the months and years ahead. As we have said before, we are building Marcus as a fully integrated digital business. As a broad multiproduct platform, wealth management will be a key component. This is a very large market with $9 trillion in mass affluent customer assets across more than 20 million U.S. households. We are planning a multitier digital wealth platform, currently in early development. Our offerings will further leverage our existing Ayco executive counseling business where we serve 60 of the Fortune 100, but only about 220 of the top 1,000. Ayco has the potential to carry us deeper into these organizations to facilitate the growth of a meaningful mass affluent wealth business. Now, let's focus on resource optimization on Page 8. We are evaluating our activities across a range of balance sheet dimensions, including capital and funding. We've grown deposits at a compounded rate of 16% over the past three years, diversifying our liability mix and lowering funding costs. Going forward, we expect to grow our aggregate U.S. and UK retail online deposits on average by more than $10 billion a year. For every $10 billion of wholesale funding replaced with deposits, we estimate savings of roughly $100 million in interest expense annually. To utilize these deposits, we will continue to migrate businesses, such as foreign exchange into our bank entities. On the capital side, we have identified two key areas where we can further optimize, in FIC and in our private equity investments. In FIC, we've made material progress, reducing standardized RWAs by approximately 40% over the past five years. We endeavor to do more from here, while identifying attractive opportunities for redeployment. Next, our private equity investments, which have generated strong returns, also require significant stress capital. Overtime, as I mentioned earlier, we will seek to reduce the capital intensity of this business by managing more client assets in fund form and reducing our balance sheet investments. On platforms, we are actively pursuing a number of work streams to digitize manual activities, expand straight through processing and reduce cost per trade. Our front-to-back efforts include uplifts to client on-boarding, asset servicing, collateral management, margin valuation and settlement processes. Investments in these initiatives will better position us with systematic clients who demand lower latency and higher efficiency platforms. Finally, we are streamlining expenses and organizational structure. We are vertically integrating 7,500 operations and engineering professionals directly into the business to enhance the client experience and provide greater expense accountability to our business leaders. We're also making a number of changes to reduce cost and drive long-term operating leverage by increasing use of shared platforms across our business, and migrating more of our efforts to locations like Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City. One thing we will not do, however, is compromise our risk, compliance and control functions, which remain independent and fully resourced. After a period of investment in 2019 and 2020, we expect these efforts to drive our efficiency ratio lower overtime. Based on last year's results for every 100 basis points in efficiency ratio reduction we achieve, it equates to approximately $300 million of net income and a 40 basis point increase in ROE all else equal. Before moving to discuss the quarter, let me turn to Page 9, where we layout a roadmap for what to expect in the coming quarters in terms of performance targets, financial disclosure and a broader discussing of the strategic way forward for Goldman Sachs. Today, we discussed initial takeaways from our front to back reviews, which will continue. Next, over the coming quarters and on the basis of our work, we expected to find publicly a performance target to which we will hold ourselves accountable. As we move toward the back half of the year, we will pursue opportunities for improved disclosure to align with any changes in our business or organizational structure. Lastly, we expect to provide a more comprehensive and strategic update through the lens of any enhanced disclosure by the first quarter of next year. Now, let me switch gears to our financial performance, beginning on Page 10. As David mentioned, the environment in the first quarter turned out to be mixed with back end of the quarter proving stronger than the front. Against this backdrop, we concentrated on serving our clients and investing to drive our business forward. Let's run through the numbers. Turning to page 11. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $1.8 billion down 11% versus the solid fourth quarter and flat versus a year ago as very strong advisory performance offset a sharp decline in underwriting. Financial advisory revenues were $887 million, up 51% versus last year, driven by our leading market share. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $390 billion and closed on nearly $370 billion of deal of volume, ranking number one in global completed M&A. Client dialogs remained healthy and we are seeing increased activity in sectors, including financials, TMT, natural resources and healthcare. This is noteworthy as M&A activity in financials has been relatively slow over the past several years. Moving to underwriting, net revenues were $923 million in the first quarter, down 24% from a year ago and up 9% versus the fourth quarter. Equity underwriting net revenues of $271 million declined sharply versus last year, driven by a lack of IPO activity. In the first quarter, we ranked first globally in equity underwriting with $16 billion of deal volume across nearly 75 transactions. Debt underwriting net revenues were $652 million, down 18% from a year ago. The first quarter of last year was our second highest quarter ever, causing a very strong comparable as it was aided by significant contributions from acquisition related and leverage finance activity. Our Investment Banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter as revenues were realized. Of note, our equity underwriting backlog increased in the quarter in part due to delayed activity, as well as an overall pick up in IPO interest. We are optimistic that a number of significant technology companies are expected to come to market later this year. Moving to institutional client services on Page 12. Net revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter, up nearly 50% compared to the fourth quarter and down 18% versus the first quarter of last year. FIC client execution net revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, more than doubling fourth quarter levels, reflecting a better operating environment. We saw higher sequential performance across all five of our global fixed-income businesses as markets reverse the sharp December risk off moves. FIC revenues, however, declined 11% versus the first quarter of 2018 amid lower client activity. We saw lower revenues in rates, currencies and credit, while commodities and mortgages improved. Turning to equities on Page 13. Net revenues for the first quarter were $1.8 billion, up 10% sequentially but down 24% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Equities client execution net revenues of $682 million fell significantly relative to a robust first quarter of 2018, which was our highest quarter performance in the past four years. Results were impacted by significantly lower performance in derivatives, given lower market volatility versus the first quarter of 2018 when volatility was elevated and client activity was robust. Commissions and fees net revenues were $714 million, driven by lower client volumes versus both last quarter and versus a year ago. Securities services net revenues of $370 million fell by 14% year-over-year amid lower average client balances as hedge funds deleveraged, though balances have been recovering. Moving to investing in lending on Page 14. Collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.8 billion in the first quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $847 million, reflecting net gains from private and public equities, company specific events and corporate performance. Approximately 40% of our net revenues was from real estate. The first quarter demonstrated more muted results in equity INL relative to the performance of public equity markets. As I have commented on the last earnings call, this seeming inconsistency is because our portfolio skews more to private securities than public holdings as shown on the slide, and there were less event driven valuation remarks of our private equity holdings. Our global equity portfolio was $22 billion at quarter end and remains well diversified with roughly 1,000 different investments. It is also diversified by investment vintage and geography as shown on the slide. Net revenues from debt securities and loans on Page 15 were $990 million and included $835 million of net interest income. Results included small mark to market gains, driven by underlying credit fundamentals. Our total lending portfolio was $96 billion, up $2 billion, driven by corporate loan growth. Approximately 85% of our total loan portfolio remained secured. Our credit provision was $224 million, roughly flat versus last quarter. Our firm-wide net charge-off ratio remained low at 50 basis points. On Page 16, turning to investment management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the first quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading PWM franchise. Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.3 billion, which were largely inline versus the fourth quarter. Overall, revenues declined versus a year ago due to significantly lower incentive fees and lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.6 trillion, up $57 billion versus the fourth quarter, driven by $20 billion of long-term net inflows in fixed income strategies and $59 billion of market appreciation, that being partially offset by $22 billion of liquidity product outflows. Now, let me turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total operating expenses decreased by 11% versus the first quarter of last year, reflecting lower compensation and benefits expense and lower activity related brokerage clearing exchange fees. For the quarter, our efficiency ratio was approximately 67%, up 100 basis point versus year ago largely driven by lower revenues. Next on taxes, our reported tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. This rate reflects our earnings mix and discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium-term estimate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on Page 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.7% using the standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced. The ratios improved by 40 and 30 basis points respectively versus year end, driven by higher retained earnings. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4%, up 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock re-purchases of $1.25 billion and approximately $300 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at a record low of 378 million shares. Our book value per share was $209. The limited growth this quarter was driven by credit spread tightening and its impact on DBA. Lastly, our Board approved a 6% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.85 per share in the second quarter. Turning to Page 19 for balance sheet and liquidity. Our balance sheet was $925 billion, down 1% versus last quarter. On the liability side, our deposit base totaled over $164 billion this quarter, up $6 billion versus year end. Our global core liquid assets averaged $234 billion during the quarter, which may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand. Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. Our first quarter performance reflected the mixed operating environment, but we are cautiously optimistic that momentum late in the quarter can continue. We are making significant investments in our future to deepen and expand our client franchise and drive growth in each of our businesses. Combined with our investment in platforms and scale this positions us to create significant value for the clients we serve and solid long-term return to our shareholders. Importantly, we look forward to a continued dialogue with you on our strategic plans of the course of 2019 and beyond. With that, thank you again for dialing in. And we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Just a quickie on numbers on the comp ratio being lower, it\u2019s in line with what past years would be. Is that a pull forward? Meaning is that your best estimate for the year, or are we looking at a lower comp ratio environment to help support returns? Stephen Scherr : So as you know in each quarter, we make our best assessment of what comp would be and fix the ratio on that basis. There is no fundamental change in policy that's implied in this. And as I said on the last call and we will continue to say forward our view is that we will encourage people to look at overall expenses both comp and non-comp, particularly as we roll out and build platforms that will yield higher marginal margin and that ultimately are less consumptive of comp intensive expense so much as OpEx intensive expense. But no policy shift implied in this. Glenn Schorr : And on litigation front, only $37 million in the quarter \u2013 I will ask in different way. Do you feel like you have the handle on 1MDB and that's why there's a low litigation number? Or is it just not estimable probable at this point so you can't really reserve for it? Stephen Scherr : I think based on reserves that we have taken over the past several quarters, we feel confident that those reserves are proper and adequate. Obviously, each quarter we reach out both to internal, legal and accounting experts, as well as those outside the firm so as to reassess circumstances, not just on 1MDB but any and all litigation. And so the number in this quarter is just a reflection of that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : First question just on activity levels, I think one of the challenges is during the quarter, obviously, week first half and then that's improved but I think some of the things that you guys mentioned in terms of M&A, the pipeline weaker just given what completed but ECM better. I think you mentioned prime brokerage balance is picking up. So just wanted to get a sense on what areas of the business you think can reverse relatively quickly versus what areas you may take a bit longer for that confidence to come back to where we were, say in September of last year? David Solomon : Michael, I will comment just broadly. There is no question that the sentiment in the early part of the quarter was quite muted. As I said before, corporations tend to be more thoughtful and take a longer time to shift those sentiments. While there is no question from issuing activity that will come out of corporations certainly slowed. I'd say that gets back to moving at a normal pace relatively quickly. The strategic M&A stuff is much more long cycle. And I don't think it's really been that significantly disrupted and the activity levels would certainly show that. In terms of market activity and client engagement, we saw significant pickup in the second half of the quarter. And given the environment that we're in that pick up can certainly continue. Now I prefaced it's only two weeks into the quarter, so it's hard to take any forward judgment on that. But I think that that activity level certainly improved meaningfully in the second half of the quarter. Stephen Scherr : Michael, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think in equities, we're seeing and saw over the quarter month-by-month increases in prime balances, which speaks to an increasing level of activity. And I think if you look at the equity I&L line, though it doesn't necessarily skew to where the public equity markets fit, I think there is obviously the opportunity to take advantage of a positive environment just in terms of event driven valuation and the like as we play forward. Michael Carrier : And then maybe just one the non-comp expenses, and some of the focus on efficiency. Stephen, you mentioned on the optimization efforts some of the things that you guys are focused on. Just wanted to get a sense, based on the investments that you have made over the past few years. Is that starting to slow and are some of these optimization efforts, will we start to see that come through in 2019? Is it more 2020 and beyond? Stephen Scherr : First, I think when you look at the efficiency ratio obviously it was up on the quarter, which was more reflection of revenues being down than it is expenses, because expenses obviously came down. We've all said in the past that '19 is going to be the deeper part of the curve. I think when you look at investments that are being made over the course of '19 and '20, we have a view as we're now developing three year models as to when we'll see or begin to see efficiency play through. You'll see that in the context of cost per trade, you'll see that in the context of platforms that take lift, which carry with them higher marginal margin and less intensity in terms of expenses being put to it beyond the investment horizon. And so I would say that over the next several years, you will start to see that efficiency play through with the investment as I say being more profound now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start-off with a question on the I&L strategy. So you outlined efforts to increase fee-based recurring revenues and reduced the volatility in that principle investment line. One of the interesting comments that was made is that you noted this would be ROE accretive overtime, which is something that many investors have questioned just given the significant gains generated within equity I&L. I am just wondering how we should think about the driver of ROE accretion as some of those more volatile, but still elevated revenue streams go away. And is there any way for us as outsiders at this point in time maybe size the amount of stress capital that's allocated for that business today? David Solomon : I think that it's important to understand this transition as just that, which is a transition away from the balance sheet intensive investing to one which is predicated largely on managing third-party money and generating fee revenue, which itself will dampen P&L volatility and be less consumptive of balance sheet is going to take time. That time is really management on our part to ensure that as we graduate down the slope of the curve of the balance sheet investing, we're mindful of the curve of taking up third party assets and the revenue generated from it. But that will be much less balance sheet consumptive and therefore, less consumptive of stress capital, which is this I&L is an area that as you know is consumptive of that. And so, this shift is really a reflection of that and I think it will bear out over a transitionary period. Steven Chubak : And one more question for me is just on funding optimization. So in the deck and in your remarks, you noted that $10 billion plus deposit growth target for year with that 100 basis point spread benefit by replacing higher cost wholesale funds with lower cost deposits. Just looking at the momentum that you have in growing deposits. Is it fair to say that the $10 billion number is a conservative target? And how should we think about capacity or the upper bound on how much wholesale funding can be replaced with those lower cost deposits over time? David Solomon : So I think your characterization of it being conservative is correct, it is. It's a conservative estimate. If you look back over the last several quarters, we've seen pretty demonstrable growth and take-up, both in the U.S. and in particular in the UK platform. I would also say as it relates to deposits that over time you will start to see us build greater functionality around the deposit platform such that we are ultimately less reliable or less reliant, if you will, on price as the key element. Right now, the firm is a better incremental buyer of retail deposits and the numbers that we're suggesting as rules of thumb about how [inside] [ph] the funding cost of wholesale, these deposits come are largely predicated on where we currently are in terms of price. But we will be able to lower beta as and to the extent we put on greater functionality, greater stickiness, greater privity with those depositors. But this is a conservative estimate in the context of I think what we're capable of growing and for that matter, whether there won't be other jurisdictions that we eventually look at. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: I was just wondering if you could comment on why the review has taken so long. It's not necessarily a bad thing, I appreciate you're being thorough, comprehensive and you're obviously not standing still while the processes is underway. But it does seem like a long time to wait until the first quarter of next year. I was just wondering if you could comment on that. David Solomon : And I will start by saying that as we're moving forward on our reviews we're doing it in a way where certainly there is a lot of urgency to make progress. We're also trying to make sure as we move forward and we have things that we can say that bring more transparency and what we're doing to you that we're doing at, and hopefully you feel that today's presentation is another example of this. But we also recognize that as we do this, we want to get it right, we want to be clear, we want to make sure that people in our organization can put it forward with respect to their businesses where the kinds of investments we're making over multiple years, or things that we can really stand behind as we work toward targets, which is something that we haven't done before, we want to make sure that we're getting them right. And so this is something that we feel we can execute on in the highest caliber way and be comfortable that we're moving forward. And from our perspective is a management team, we're looking to build value over the next three to five years, not over the next couple of quarters. And so we're trying to balance the fact that you all want more quicker and we understand that, but we're going to make sure we do it in the highest quality way we can. And we think this is the right time period and right approach for us to execute flawlessly. Matt O'Connor: And then I know there have been some speculation recently in media that you might be doing an Investor Day this year, I assume that would not happen this year and might be on the table first quarter next year? Stephen Scherr : I think that the form and substance of what we will do, we'll decide as we get closer. I would point just to key off of David's comments. There is no intention here for us to go dark between now and then. In fact, as David said, we're going to engage in a very regular cadence and you're seeing it already obviously in the context of the presentation that we're putting in front of you. And in the interim period, performance targets will be on the offing and we will review whether financial disclosure needs to change in the context of the change in shape and profile of our business and our organizational structure. And so I think all of that will put us in a place where we have a cleaner and more forward looking lens through which we and you look at our business. And whether that takes the form of Investor Day or some other form for a comprehensive update, we'll engage in that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : So understanding that the review is ongoing. But Stephen I think you spoke in your prepared remarks about focus on the FIC business. You highlighted a small example within the commodities business. So what I thought might be interesting is to hear, or may be you provide a little bit more incremental color to help us frame what kind of an impact on the expense and capital in commodities you all discover and help us to think about how that might inform, considering the full impact or a broader impact to FIC at least from an early indication. Stephen Scherr : Sure. I would say the following. As a general matter, we are looking to make changes in the way in which we're engaging in FIC, all with an eye toward generating considering more revenue for the division and at the same time, optimizing to the deployment of capital and reducing down expense. On the revenue side, particularly in commodities but through elsewhere around the division, we want to meet our clients where they want to execute. And in commodities, equally in credit, equally across FX, we are seeing the opportunity to engage more substantially in low-touch client engagement around systematic market makers. It means we need to develop those platforms in order to do it. Those will inevitably be lower costs in the context of per-trade cost and engagement. All the while, we are looking at areas where we can reduce down the capital intensity. There are obviously some trades that have been put on historically that have long-lived capital consumption. We look at areas where we can reduce those. But honestly in the context of making those assessments, shareholders value is front and center, which is I'm not going to look to release capital out of those trades to the extent that exercise is dilutive to shareholders value. We'll do it where it's accretive. I would also say that if you look across all of the businesses within FIC, each of them has their own orientation and the work we're doing both to generate capital, consume less capital and equally be more efficient in terms of expense. So for example, the Europe business has been in the bank, it benefits from lower cost funding that sits in the bank and we're looking at ways in which we can be more efficient in the deployment of capital. In FX, we're looking to put more of that business in the bank so as to avail it-self of diversified funding. We're redoubling our efforts in commodities around businesses, which exhibit the low touch client platforms where clients want to engage. We're looking at capital consumption in mortgages. We're looking at electronic platforms with shorten our risk within credit. All of these are examples where we're driving to lower cost, lower capital consumption. And as we get through this review, we'll be in a position to give you a sense of how to quantify that. Brennan Hawken : And then a more broad question on the consumer efforts. I know that you can't really get into the details on the Apple card at this point, because it's not public. But when you guys initially talked about, or I guess I should say when Goldman initially talked about the consumer efforts, the idea was as a disrupter to establish players. And then I guess when we saw the card announcement, understanding that there is innovation embedded, card generally is viewed as lot more of a need to lending product. So can you, at a high level, frame how we should think about the consumer business and whether or not disrupter is still the right way to think about it, or growing a little bit more in line with establish players? And then in card specifically, tends to be a scale business. How should we think about this at Goldman over the coming years? How many partnerships do you want to ultimately have? Is this going to be a co-brand approach where competition is higher but stickiness better? Maybe some high level comments to help us think about that, going forward. Thanks. Stephen Scherr : So I think judgments as to how disruptive the card will be, I think will be in the aisle of the holder once we launch it publically. And I think what you will find is a level of innovation that Apple is known for and that Goldman Sachs, as an innovator with some technology edge. And as David had said, the absence of legacy technology and importantly the absence of a legacy business will enable us to be and has enabled us to be innovative along with Apple as a partner. So I think you will see those and make your judgment at the time. But I think ingredient to us being disruptive is, as David laid out early in his prepared remarks, which is no incumbent business, no legacy technology, all of which lens to being more disruptive in a broad sense. I think just wide now beyond the card to the broader consumer business that has been our intent all along, which is we're looking to build one coherent business, that is Marcus. There are verity of products, we started with a verity of projects. In each of them, we have looked at and looked for markets that are big where we don't need to capture commanding market share to be relevant. We've also looked at markets and at products where there were pain-points felt by the consumer. We've done that I think successfully but early in loans and now we're aiming to do that in the card space. And I think those are the mileposts that you should look for in the context of where we can be disruptive. Finally, on your question of scale, I would say that scale as an objective is now playing out across the whole of the firm. We build scale in Marcus in our underwriting algorithms and platforms and in our delivery, not just to scale cards and deposits but now equally with respect to credit cards. And I think that orientation is a benefit to us in terms of how we build. I'd also say that the technology is useful in the context of other things that we're doing like corporate cash management. And so that's the general direction of traffic for the consumer business. But I think it reflects more broadly on the overall firm as David laid out in the presentation. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Just in terms of delivering one firm, I think its pretty clear on the wholesale side but less so on the consumer side. And I know your intention is to change single-product relationships to multi-product relationships overtime. How long would that take? Is it one year, three years, five years, 10 year, because right now, it seems like single-product offerings, whether the upcoming credit card or deposits or loans. Thanks. Stephen Scherr : You know from the beginning, our ambition here was to grow out a business, a common platform with multiple products, some we own, some we don't. And that's a process. We began obviously with two products, that being deposits and loans. But you need to begin somewhere and that's where we began. But we're now beginning to pull all of this together in the context of a common business and platform. And so I will give you an example of the delivery of the whole firm. In a very narrow context within consumer, we're already seeing the benefits of Clarity Money, which is bring integrated into the whole of the consumer effort. And so the take up of deposit account openings off of those who use Clarity Money is higher than what we had expected and what you might see in the industry, equally in the contest and the category of delivering the firm in consumer. Make no mistake that bring together Marcus with our investment management division had a strategic component to it, which was we were a business that for many, many years obviously managed funds and managed asset for high net worth individuals. Bringing that DNA to bear as to how we will roll out a mass affluent platform is very real and has synergistic effect in terms of bringing those businesses together. And I'd also add that in the build of the mass affluent wealth business, the notion of having GSAM as the factory floor for products that we could offer is yet another example bringing all of Goldman Sachs to bear in the consumer space where there might be some doubt as to whether or not that had potential. Michael Mayo : And then one I guess unrelated follow up. 1MDB, it seems like there is a very big bid-ask spead. Malaysia talking about $7 billion and I guess you've reserved less than $1 billion. And I know the investigation is onging, I know you can't interfere with the DoJ process. Having said that, what is there that you can do to facilitate the process? It seems like from what I can tell, Malaysia would like to have some resolution, you would like to have some resolution. Its a matter of coming up with some settlement. What are the obstetrical? What's under your control? Thanks. David Solomon : So, first I would just say that nobody wants to get to resolution on this faster than we do. And we are absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to move the process along as quickly as possible. I think all I can say at this point is that the firm using its resources and what is available to us is working diligently and with urgency to reach a resolution. There are processes that exit in the process here and the process in Malaysia, they take more time than we necessarily as business people just doing a deal would like to see even through. But we're working at it and we'll reach resolution as quickly as possible. And unfortunately I'm just not in a position to give you more clarity on what I think that timing look like. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : So first question here just on the mass affluent opportunity within Marcus, Ayco and other firm had corporate relationships, seem to provide a very strong customer acquisition channel. But I would think that you would also want to make sure that the platform is developed enough to get traction with those relationships. So I'm just trying to get little bit sense of the role out plan or timing of really going deeper into all those strong relationships. And whether this is already occurring or if you need more pieces to the puzzle of the platform and to trying to get a sense of timing here is as it's all coming together in real time? Stephen Scherr : So on the development as the mass affluent business, I would say we are in the midpoint of the development plans in developing a blueprint as to how to go about this. I think what we've seen based on other efforts in this space is that this likely will be some mixed approach in the context of both technology and human engagement. I think that what's very clear to us is that place of work as a point of wealth aggregation is an interesting entry point in terms of gaining share and gaining position with perspective customers of this. Our view on the Ayco business is that we have in-house, as you suggest, a very real inconsequential business that for a long while had focused on the C-suite of very large corporations and has done an exceptionally good job in engaging there. But I think that looking beyond the C-suite to several thousand employees that exist within a place of the employee and the ability to develop the business introduction that Ayco has carries enormous potential. And we're already seeing, for example, ways in which Ayco has been involved with a variety of companies in managing their wealth in the corporate sense, including discussions we've had and have been public about with respect to Google. So the take up in the place of work I think is an opportune place to engage. I'd also say that going back to the question that was raised earlier, looking at the range of different businesses, whether its savings or the loans business, or Clarity Money, are all entr\u00e9es and ingredients to generate momentum into a business. But Ayco is going to be a very significant entry point, because when you look at these consumer businesses, obviously, customer acquisition is a sticky cell in the model and solving for that is important. And I think we've got the early makings of where our entry point into that business can be. Devin Ryan : And just a follow up here just around the plan to move 7,500 people from operations and engineering and specific businesses, I'm curious the individuals are already focusing on those businesses or was this just more of a geographic change just to better allocate expenses and their contribution? Or people actually going to become more focused in terms of what they do? And then I'm just trying to think about what the implications are from either earnings, returns or anything else for you can remind there. Stephen Scherr : So I think this is largely about moving people who have an existing focus on that particular business. And the idea here is that we want to bring them closer to the front end of the business, such that where there are platforms or where there are processing issues that otherwise were call out to a separate division. This is now being done within the control of the business in house. Now whether or not that leads into greater cost efficiency and the like remains to be seen, but that's the objective. The objective is to put more control into the hands of the business to do it. I should also point out that there are certain aspects of engineering and of operations that are not going to move to the businesses, and that's in the control space. So people who are involved, for example in the movement of funds in or out of the firm, that's not going to move to a division. It's going to move -- it's going to stay square within my remit in the control sense. I'd also point out that the overarching objective of moving these people into the businesses is really to improve the client experience that our clients and customers have with those businesses. If you look at the securities business, in particular and you look at the engagement that customers have had with us, it used to be entirely front end human intensive the sales person mattered and perhaps that was the person all that mattered. And this is changing. The way in which we look at overall trade flow from the beginning through to the middle and in the context of collateral management through to settlement, the place of operations in that chain now matters more than it's ever mattered in the past in the context of our engagement and the question of customer satisfaction and client satisfaction with the business. And in the early days of repositioning these people into, in this case, the securities division I think has paid considerable reward in terms of the satisfaction and the greater take on business that our business is capable of harvesting. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : David, you mentioned in the strategic review that you are looking to build value over the next three to five years. When we compare your business, specifically markets in Investment Banking as a percentage of revenue, it's obviously quite a bit higher than some of your peers like JP Morgan, Citigroup and Bank of America. Should investors expect that as a result of the review that those two businesses as a percentage of total revenue should flow closer to those competitors or will those still remain elevated? Stephen Scherr : I think that you have to expect if you just look at the size and the scale of their more traditional banking operations and their consumer banking operation, it's going be more elevated than their businesses. But we're committed, as we had products and services and diversified in what we're doing to continue to expand and shift the make-up to a degree where we think it will continue to fall. But I don't think we can have any expectation that when you look at our footprint and the footprint of those big, for lack of a better term universal bank competitors that we're heading anywhere close to that direction quickly. Operator : Your next question is from line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Two questions, one on NII. It now represents about 45% of your investing and lending revenues. And if you look at the growth rate of it, it's going to continue to push higher and it's much more sustainable in some of gains that you get in and out any the quarter in the other part of the business. Any thought about separating that out and calling at something else as you're building out the banking part of the business? Stephen Scherr : Well, as I said at the start. Over the course of the next several months, we're going to take a long hard look at ways in which we can enhance disclosure, so as to meet the changing profile of our business and organization. And so we'll do our best. And as I said on the prior call, investing and lending is a bit of a challenge in the context of the forward view and where all of you have insight. And so we'll do we can to improve. What I will say in the context of the NII is that we paced last year at about $2.7 billion this year based on the quarter, we're looking at something closer to $3.3 billion. I will say that the economic consequence of that lending to the firm is greater than what that number indicates. This is all franchise adjacent lending. It matters and is accretive to our PWM business. It matters and is accretive to our Investment Banking business. And so this lending is with clients and customers that we know well and has a tie into a series of linkages and adjacencies all-in throughout the firm. I would also point out that from a risk point of view, we continue to watch this obviously, in the context of the cycle and where we are. And to that end, we remain close to 85% secured in the context of this overall book. And so we're pleased with the direction of traffic here and we'll do our best to make sure that we put reporting around it that meets everybody's needs. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead. Al Alevizakos : So you've mentioned plenty of times that you're consider yourself a technology firm. And clearly, you have embarked in a plethora of exciting new ventures. So in my view likely we can already see some of the amount of money that you put and the P&L impact for increased technology and amortization. However, at the same time, you remain one of the few U.S. players not to give out an explicit IT budget figure, or at least provide us with a split between the run the bank and change the bank IT spending. Would you be able to provide either number this time around? Thank you. Stephen Scherr : So we will over time look to give you greater insight into the overall spend and the cost of spend in the disclosure that we will give you. I would say that we are investing, as you rightly point out, a considerable amount of money both in the run the bank and the change of bank. The run the bank is in the context of the introduction of platforms and the development of, for example, an institutional digital platform like Marquee. Whereas I said in my comments, this has the potential to create considerable stickiness and the use by customers and clients on an API basis of that platform where they consume content and data and ultimately look to trade with us. And so we're spending money in a platform like this. I'd also say that in Marcus we have given out some numbers around that. So at the end of '18, we had spent roughly about $1 billion in that. We're now at about $1.1 billion that as it relates to all of the consumer initiatives that are at play. But we aim to be more disclosive going forward in terms of the overall context of disclosure around our investment spend in these various technologies. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just have one question that was on the IB backlog. If you could just walk through some of what was the driver and the drop quarter-on-quarter? And now that you're into more certain about macro environment without the government shutdown and all that, would you expect it to increase from here? Thanks. Stephen Scherr : So the decrease in the overall backlog was largely a reflection of the bookings in the quarter in connection with M&A activity that was close and ultimately fees booked. And obviously that moves just mechanically out of backlog and into the P&L. We continue to see, as David had suggested earlier, a fairly consistent and robust level of dialogue on future M&A activity, which is buoyed both by where asset prices are, the continued attractiveness of financing. And so our expectation is that we would see that backlog rebuild in the context of it. I would point out that within the backlog we saw an uptick in the backlog in equities, so this is IPO related activity. And I spoke probably about our expectation in the quarter for a number of big tech IPOs to come. And so that backlog tends to fluctuate depending upon bookings, but we feel pretty good in terms of direction of traffic of the business itself. The one other thing I would say just on backlog is that, on an historical basis, it still remains very, very high for the business overall. And so I think that while we often look at quarter-to-quarter movement in the backlog, it's equally important to pull the lens out a bit and just at it historically. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead. Andrew Lim : Thanks for taking my questions, and I appreciate very much the extra disclosure that you've given. But I'm still struggling to understand some trends, especially in I&L, so on the equity side for four quarter now, we have had declining I&L net revenues. I was wondering if you could give some color on the main drivers behind that. And I'm trying to square that with the carrying value of the portfolio versus the market value with respect to private equity. And then I'll just give you my follow on question in I&L as well on the debt security side. You've had this really big 30% increase in net interest income over the course of the year. I was wondering if you could give some color as to how that improvement that's come about through and expansion in asset yields versus an expansion and liability yields that you saw at your wholesale funding for customer deposits. And how we might expect that to improve going forward as you continue to raise customer deposits, let's assume that asset yield stay flat going forward just for the sake of argument, if you continue to raise customer deposits. How can we expect that $8 million to $35 million to increase over coming quarters? Stephen Scherr : So let me take your two questions if you don't mind in the inverse. I will start with the second one, which is on the debt I&L, and the growth in net interest income. Consistent with my response to the question earlier, you should consider seeing that continue to grow. As I mentioned earlier, client adjacent lending that serves a number of different businesses around the firm. And I think that the margin that we will see on that lending will only improve to the extent that we further diversify as we have laid-out as a strategic priority the overall funding mix of the firm. And so as and to the extent that we engage in this lending through the bank, we can avail ourselves of lower cost funding provided by retail deposits, which were obviously growing as I've had mentioned now several times in the call. So I think you'll see NII increase. It will increase both in terms of volume by virtue of the adjacencies that it poses to the firm and equally the margin will increase to the extent that we avail ourselves of lower cost funding. On the first part of your question about the equity I&L, again it's important to understand that as you see on the chart, this is a portfolio that skews demonstrably toward private equity and not public. And as that trend line has happened, you see less price action by virtue of the public equity markets than you otherwise would. Where we hold public equity is obviously those are marked and priced relative to where the observable public price is on that particular equity. In private equity positions, this doesn't always run and skew and hone relative to public market prices. So this is very event driven. You may see up or down movement in the private equity portfolio occasioned by some event where we might sell a possible. It might be that there is another round of equity investing at a different valuation level that causes us to remark that. There may be performance that proves positive in a given company that causes us to remark that position. So it's very event driven. It doesn't necessarily hone to what you see in terms of public equity prices. And as a consequence, it can be high or low in any given quarter and not necessarily correlating to public price movement. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Okay. Since there are no further questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

David will start with a high level review of our financial performance, the current operating environment, give an update on several recent strategy decisions and discuss our stress test results. Stephen will then cover second quarter results across each of our businesses. They will be happy to take your questions after that. I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks Heather. And thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I am very happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. We reported second quarter 2019 revenues of $9.5 billion, down slightly versus last year, but nonetheless reflecting solid franchise performance amid a mixed operating environment.  Net earnings were $2.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $5.81. All in, we posted return on equity of 11.1% and a return on tangible equity of 11.7%. Our business performed well and remained solidly positioned for future growth. In Investment Banking, we ranked number one in global announced and completed M&A and number one in global equity underwriting year-to-date. Our equity market making business delivered its second highest quarter in four years, and our franchise continues to generate broad based market share gains across regions. We produced the quarterly I&L revenues in eight years, aided by significant gains from our private equity investment - investing activities reflecting our ability to source opportunities for the firm and our clients, and record net interest income in debt I&L which annualizes the $3.5 billion. Lastly, our assets under supervision increased by over $60 billion to another record of $1.7 trillion. Turning to Page 2, our second quarter results were generated on an operating backdrop that presented both opportunities and challenges. This quarter perhaps more than others reflected changing market sentiment in each of the three component months. Against this shifting sentiment, we continued to witness relatively solid underlying economic fundamentals. This year, we expect real GDP growth of approximately 2.5% in the US and 3.4% globally. European growth remains a bit more subdued at about 1.5%. As recently reported, China is running in the low 6% range, slower than it has been in many years, but still supportive of global growth. All in while slowing, the global macro backdrop remains broadly constructive. The strong fundamentals that prevailed across markets were nonetheless overshadowed for most of the second quarter by geopolitical uncertainty. Client activity in April turned quiet amid low volatility particularly in fixed income markets. Conditions in May deteriorated as geopolitical events caused significant shift in risk appetite. Fears of expanding trade wars drove concerns that new tariffs in China and Mexico would erode the prospects for continued growth. In response, equity volatility then increased; global markets turned risk off, the US yield curve inverted, and client activity slowed across a variety of products as our corporate and investment clients stayed on the sidelines. The trade issues also catalyzed concern among global central banks prompting dovishness with the Bank of Japan and the ECB emphasizing potential further stimulus and the US market is now anticipating multiple Fed rate cuts this year. The articulated dovish sentiment spurred a relief rally and increased client optimism and activity albeit late in the quarter. This set up June to be a stronger backdrop to close out the quarter. The market sentiment in June has continued through today. We've seen a pause in the US-China trade war, accommodative views from central banks, and continued march upward in global equity markets. Credit financing markets remain open and strategic transactions are getting announced. As we look ahead, we remain cautious on the geopolitical front, but optimistic given the resiliency of global markets. Importantly, our clients' long-term needs for advice, financing, and access to markets endure across cycles. Switching gears, I'd like to provide some insights on two important strategic decisions we made in the second quarter and our alternatives in wealth management businesses. First, on alternatives, which is our core strengths for Goldman Sachs for the past 30 years, we recently completed an internal reorganization of our investing activities across the firm. More specifically, we have realigned our special situations group, real estate, merchant banking, and several other investing platforms under common merchant banking business. We have a world-class investing franchise with a strong track record, unique sourcing and execution capabilities, and long-standing relationships with the largest institutional investors. Going forward, these teams will operate across four asset classes; private equity, growth equity, private credit, and real estate. By bringing together our investment professionals, we will accelerate our ability to raise significant third party capital. We expect this change will enable us to generate more durable recurring fee based revenues over time. This will be a transition. We are mindful of protecting the revenue potential of these businesses as we grow third party assets. Second, we announced plans to acquire United Capital, registered investment advisor with approximately $25 billion in assets under supervision, 220 advisers and 90 offices around the country. United Capital represents a key step forward toward our long-term strategic goal of providing comprehensive wealth management services to individuals across the wealth spectrum. Upon closing the transaction today, United Capital will become a powerful complement to our Ayco business, our leading financial executive counseling and investment advisory business, which serves many of the largest corporations in the United States. We are excited about the incremental scale that United Capital brings, allowing us to serve a broader set of wealth management clients. On a combined basis, Ayco and United Capital will serve clients with over $80 billion of assets under supervision, representing a strong base from which to grow our mass affluent wealth franchise. It remains ambitious -- it remains our ambition to continue to serve ultra-high net-worth individuals through our longstanding PWM business. Individuals with $1 million to $5 million of investable assets through Ayco and the broader mass affluent segment through a hybrid of digital and human engagement as an extension of markets over time. Before turning the call over to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on the recent Federal Reserve stress test result released in late June, which showed bank\u2019s ability to withstand over $400 billion stress losses. Overall, the industry fared well in this year's examination. From where I sit, the results of the stress test clearly demonstrate the overall safety and soundness of the US financial system. We also appreciate the ongoing efforts to increase the transparency of the test and very much agree with the Fed's overall assessment that the US banking system is sufficiently well capitalized to support the economy even after a severe shock. Turning specifically to our performance on the 2019 CCAR examination. As you are now therefore aware, we disclosed the Federal Reserve did not object to our plan of up to $8.8 billion of capital return including a 0.47% increase on our quarterly common stock dividend. This change reflects the board and management view that dividend growth is a critical component to delivering strong shareholder returns, and reflects our progress over recent years increasing more durable fee-based revenues to support the higher dividend. Lastly, I would like to briefly touch on our strategic communication plan over the coming quarters. Importantly, we continue to work toward providing a strategic update this coming January and we'll share a specific date once confirmed. This update will include the financial targets for the firm to which we will hold ourselves accountable and a broader review of our business strategy. With that I will turn it over to Stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses. Stephen Scherr : Thanks David. Let's run through the numbers. Let me begin on Page 3 of the presentation. As David mentioned, the environment in the second quarter turned out to be mixed. Against this backdrop, we continue to serve our clients and focus on executing on our strategic priorities. Let's run through the numbers in detail. Moving on to Page 4, Investment Banking produce net revenues of $1.9 billion, 3% versus the first quarter and down 9% versus a robust year ago quarter. Financial Advisory revenues of $776 million were down 3% versus last year. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions of approximately $465 billion and closed on $235 billion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings year-to-date.  Client dialogues remain healthy and we are seeing momentum across sectors including TMT, healthcare and notably financials, which had been rather dormant for a number of years. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $482 million improves significantly versus the first quarter which experienced the government shutdown and held roughly flat versus a strong quarter last year. Year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $16 billion of deal volume across over 100 transactions this quarter. We held leadership roles and bringing many notable companies to the public markets during the quarter including Uber, Avantor, Pinterest and Slack. Turning to Debt Underwriting, net revenues were $605 million, down 20% from a year ago. The second quarter last year included a number of significant contributions from investment grade and leveraged finance activity, which did not repeat to the same extent this quarter. Our deal flows in this quarter were consistent with trends across the industry, which reflected materially lower volumes in the loan market and lower activity in acquisition related financings, particularly with financial sponsors. Nonetheless, our franchise remains well-positioned with our high-yield league table rank rising to the number two spot year-to-date further reflecting our competitive strengths. Our investment banking backlog decreased slightly versus the end of the first quarter as we monetized a portion of our pipeline through the completion of several large equity underwritings. Nonetheless, our backlog increased sequentially in both advisory and debt underwriting. And while markets can change quickly, we are optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing strategic transactions in the coming quarters given healthy levels of client dialogue and continued need to access financing markets. Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.5 billion in the second quarter down 3% versus last year, as our diversified business experienced low client activity in FICC, offset by strength in equities. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, down 13% year-over-year reflecting both the mix operating environment and generally lower client activity despite notable strength in Europe. Overall, the opportunity set presented in the second quarter proved more challenging versus a year ago. Specifically, we saw lower volumes in our macro businesses amid low volatility and shifting client sentiment sentiment. Relative to last year, client activity and rates and currencies including emerging markets was more subdued as trade and tariff concerns more than economic data drove sentiment and constrained client engagement. Uncertainty during the quarter around the timing and magnitude of anticipated rate cuts by the Fed was also a contributing factor. As tariff threats lessened and the direction of rates became more apparent, we saw improved client activity, particularly late in the quarter. In currencies, both implied and realized volatility in major FX pairs stood at historic lows throughout the quarter, resulting in very low activity levels among our clients. Commodities performance by contrast was a positive. Results increased year-over-year on solid contributions from our industrial products, oil, and gas and power businesses. In our micro businesses, we saw lower activity and credit but better results in mortgages. In credit, issuance activity and our inventory levels were down relative to a year ago, as investors remain more cautious following the spread widening experienced at the end of 2018 and grew more discerning in credit exposure selection. We saw lower structured finance client activity versus a year ago, while closing credit came alongside a more muted origination backdrop particularly in investment grade debt and leveraged loans as I had mentioned earlier. Separately, mortgage revenues increase amidst better performance. The environment notwithstanding and as I have said previously, we are investing heavily to automate our workflows, serve our clients electronically, monitor our cost base and deliver structured solutions in capital efficient formats. Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2 billion, up 14% sequentially and up 6% versus a year ago. We believe our success reflects our continuing consolidation of global market share and a dedication to serving clients across a full suite of cash, derivatives and prime services in both hi touch and low touch channels. Equities client execution net revenues of $772 million increased 13% relative to the first quarter and were up 12% versus a year ago. Results were aided by stronger performance in both cash and derivatives versus the second quarter of 2018. Net revenues from commissions and fees were $777 million, up 9% sequentially aided by strength in EMEA. We also continue to grow market share in low touch execution. Security services net revenues of $458 million rose 24% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Sequential improvement was driven by seasonal trends and a rebound in average client balances as sentiment improved. Moving to Investing and Lending on Page 7. Collectively our activities in I&L produced net revenues of $2.5 billion in the second quarter. Equity securities generated robust net revenues of $1.5 billion, driven by company specific events like IPOs and the performance of corporates in the portfolio contributing revaluations. Second quarter results were up 20% versus a year ago, primarily reflecting higher net gains from public equities. As you can see on the slide, approximately 25% of our net revenues were from real estate and 75% were from our corporate investments. Within the corporate portfolio, nearly half of the performance came from investments that went public during the quarter. These results included a gain of approximately $375 million from the IPO of Tradeweb. Our investment in Tradeweb which we've owned since 2008 was accounted for under the equity method given our significant influence at the time of the investment. As a consequence, we did not recognize revaluation P&L on Tradeweb over the time of our investment. In addition to trade web, we would draw your attention to several other notable investments that IPO this quarter, including Avantor, Uber, and HeadHunter, which grew the notional size of our public holdings. Taken together, these four investments represent approximately 55% of our $2.6 billion public investment portfolio. Turning to Page 8, net revenues from Debt Securities and Loans were $989 million, included $872 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains. Our total loan portfolio was $98 billion, up $2 billion sequentially, driven by corporate loan growth and we note 82% of our total loan portfolio is secured. Our credit provision was $214 million, down 4%versus last quarter. Our firm wide net charged-off ratio remains low at approximately 60 basis points. On Page 9 turning to Investment Management, we produced $1.6 billion of revenues in the second quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading Private Wealth franchise. Net revenues included management and other fees of $1.4 billion which were up 5% versus the first quarter and up 4% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision. By contrast, we generated significantly lower incentive fees relative to the outsize $316 million last year. Incentive fees in the second quarter of last year were driven by the timing of realizations and performance across a variety of our alternative investment funds. We also saw lower transaction revenues from PWM client trading activity. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.7 trillion, up $61 billion versus the first quarter, driven by $17 billion of long-term net inflows, $12 billion of liquidity inflows and $32 billion of market appreciation. Now let me turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses of $6.1 billion were flat versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting lower litigation and lower compensation and benefits expense, offset by increased expense for technology and consolidated investments. For the year-to-date, total expenses were $12 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Our year-to-date efficiency ratio was 65.6%, up 100 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense. On the topic of investment spend, as we've spoken in the past, cumulatively we are making very substantial organic investments to build new businesses and digital platforms. The depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 and 2020. Investment spending will continue into 2020 when we will also see more meaningful impact of the reserve build supporting our initial growth in the Apple Card following our expected launch later this summer. Year-to-date, the total pretax cost from Markus, Apple Card and our new transaction banking platform is approximately $275 million resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE. A cumulative pretax loss for these businesses from the inception of each through the second quarter was approximately $1.3 billion which has been embedded in the performance of the firm. As these businesses scale over the coming years, this drag should not only reverse, but become an accretive contributor to the firm's ROE. Next on taxes. Our reported tax rate was 23% for the quarter and 20% for the year-to-date including discrete tax benefits in the first quarter. We continue to expect our full year 2019 tax rate to be consistent with our medium-term estimate of approximately 22% to 23%. On the compensation ratio, our philosophy remains steadfast to our principles obtain for performance. Reduction in the year-to-date ratio to 36% is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the compensation accrual for the firm, which for the full year 2018 was just below 34%. Also as we have noted in the past, as we grow more scale and platform driven businesses, it is our expectation that compensation will decline as a proportion of total operating expenses and the efficiency ratio will become a more relevant measure for the firm. These platform businesses should carry higher and marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation as a cost contributor. Turning to capital on Page 11. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.8% using the standardized approach and 13.5% under the advanced approach. The ratio is each increased by 10 basis points versus the first quarter driven by higher retained earnings. Our SLR was 6.4 % flat sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders including stock repurchases of $1.25 billion and $319 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 372 million shares. Our book value per share was $214, up 10% versus a year ago. As David mentioned, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2019 capital plan of up to $8.8 billion of total capital return, including share repurchases of up to $7 billion, 40% higher than last CCAR cycle. While we continue to assess capital return in the context of the market environment and opportunities for accretive investment in our business consistent with our long-held strategy, we are encouraged by the increased flexibility afforded by our strong capital position. We enjoy the option of returning a significant portion of our earnings to shareholders over the coming year. Following our successful completion of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, let's spend a moment reviewing our philosophy on capital. First our long-term view on capital allocation remains unchanged. We first look for opportunities to invest in our business at attractive returns to the extent we have access after these investments, we will endeavor to return it to shareholders. Second with respect to dividends versus buybacks, we aspire to having a higher dividend long term. As it's an important component of total shareholder return and it's further reflective of the firm's confidence in our ability to generate more recurring and predictable sources of revenue. That said we continue to value the flexibility of share repurchases as they allow us to be more dynamic with capital allocations based on the environment and business opportunities. Third regarding the stress capital buffer, based on our calculations and the proposed rule which may differ materially in its final form, we estimate an SCB of approximately 5.5% based on the 2019 stress test results. This would imply a total CET1 requirement excluding management buffers in the neighborhood of 12.5% to 13%, which compares favorably to our second quarter 2019 standardized ratio of 13.8%. While we view the CCAR authorization as a ceiling and not a floor on the amount of capital we will return, we are pleased to note that the $8.8 billion capacity should position the firm well to manage capital at appropriate levels. Turning to Page 12 for balance sheet and liquidity. Our balance sheet was $945 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter. On the liability side deposits increased to $166 billion including consumer deposits of over $50 billion, which we have more than doubled since last year. During the quarter, we saw further progress migrating businesses into our bank entities to take advantage of their more diversified and lower-cost funding. Our global core liquid assets averaged $225 billion during the quarter, which we continue to note may decline as we have opportunities to support client demand. Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While our second quarter performance was solid despite the mixed operating environment, we believe as David said, the overall economic growth backdrop should remain supportive of our business. As we go forward, we are executing diligently on three core objectives. One, serving our clients with excellence and growing our existing business. Two, diversifying our business into adjacent and new businesses and three, operating more efficiently in all that we do. If we do these things well, we are confident we can deliver strong, long-term returns for our shareholders. With that, thank you again for dialing in. I will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. GlennSchorr: Thanks very much. Maybe to start with a real quickie, you mentioned providing a strategic update this coming January. I'm curious what form you're thinking about meaning Investor Day, update slides on the call things like that? DavidSolomon: So thanks, Glenn and good morning. I appreciate the question. We're committed to giving a strategic update and in particular providing targets in January. As we're working towards this fall when we know the exact format and also the specific date, we'll communicate it. GlennSchorr: Okay, well as long as the numbers are good I'm cool. In I&L, I'm curious I know you're going through the process of consolidating the businesses and I'm sure there's some challenges there, but my question is on you've always been good at this but I feel like managing conflicts between advisor, balance sheet investment, and third party funds will just even be that much harder as you bring this all together and grow third party. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that. And how you will allocate investments across on balance sheet versus third party, things like that? DavidSolomon: Sure, and I appreciate the question. It's obviously something we spend a lot of time thinking about. We have spent a lot of time thinking about it because when you look at these businesses which in the past had been organized over multiple parts of the firm. We're now internally reorganizing them and bringing them together but we've been doing this for 30 years. We are one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world. We manage a very, very significant amount of third party and client capital. And I can say that there are issues from time to time to come out of this business model, but we're focused on striking the right balance and have proven over the long period of time that I think we can do this consistently. I think one of the things that you get by streamlining the organization and facing our clients as an integrated operation is it actually should make this process, the decision-making process easier and more clear. And so, we recognize it's something that we will have to continue to do well over a long period of time. We are -- I was talking to our clients and listening to our clients and they feel bringing the businesses together and organizing them, et cetera , will help us do that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. ChrisBolu: Good morning David and Stephen. Just on the targets, we look forward to getting your targets in January but how should we think about the timeframe for achieving targets? Are you setting targets you can meet over the next one to two years? Or should we be looking for more long-term aspirational targets that could take more like five years to get to? Stephen Scherr : Thanks Christian. I would say that the targets that we will focus on will be both returns and equally efficiency and in the course of putting those out our timeframe will be over the medium to longer term. We're in the midst as I said in the prepared remarks of making some meaningful investments in the business. The depth of that is going to be over the course of this year and into 2020 and the returns on that will play out over the medium term. And so the targets will be that. Along the way, we'll continue to point out as we did on this call with greater clarity as to the precision of what it is we're spending and what we're spending for, and the direction of travel and the type of returns we expect to get. But in that we're investing in particular businesses like the Apple Card, like Marcus, like transaction banking. Those will have return profiles. Equally, we're investing in platforms that will bring greater efficiency to existing businesses. Those two should have return profiles to them perhaps even inside some of the projects we have. But we will give you the medium-term targets, but take you along in terms of what plays out between now and then. ChrisBolu: Great. Thank you very much. And then on the alternatives business, so we\u2019re excited to see what this looks like when you bring it all together. I don't know if you could help us just preview maybe the size when you put all the strands together kind of what the size and maybe the growth profile of that business looks like today. And then as you look to maybe compete more against alternative asset managers, so that we were tricking one here, but how do you balance the sort of the delicate issue of doing what's right for Goldman versus competing against like a key clientele? DavidSolomon: Sure. So first, with respect to the business broadly, we plan to operate across four broad asset classes that we operate in today currently. And that includes private equity. That includes growth equity, private credit, and also real estate. And so over time, we will provide more transparency to you on the assets that currently exist in all four of these channels, which are significant and to our aspirations over time to increase the amount of third-party capital that we manage in these different asset classes. With respect to the balance and operating this, as I said to the previous question, we've been doing this for 30 years. These businesses are very significant in size right now. We have said publicly that when you look at the businesses that we operate here collectively, they make us one of the top five alternative asset managers in the world today. And so we will continue to navigate and execute that the same way we have over the last 30 years in a very, very significant business. And the fact that we're internally reorganizing it, so that we can better serve our clients does not change the process that we've executed on for a very, very long period of time. Stephen Scherr : The one other -- one other point I'll add to respond to your question is that David rightly points out this will be a transition. During that transition we do not anticipate a revenue shortfall by this movement. Meaning, we'll maintain balance sheet with the flexibility of reallocating balance sheet into different of these sleeves. As David pointed out and it's also worth noting that different sleeves whether it's credit, real estate with respect to for example equity carry different capital density and the opportunity to realize higher returns on the balance sheet deployed will be there. So we're very well aware of maintaining the revenue flow that's here and as David pointed out this will be a transition over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. MichaelCarrier: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one just on capital, so you receive the approval for more buybacks plus the dividend capital ratios have improved a lot. You're doing some on the M&A front, still investing in the business. So I guess just looking for some color on if this is sustainable, meaning being able to do everything given the repositioning of the balance sheet. Probably importantly where you are on that front particularly within like the FICC business and the alternative business. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So I think it's fair to say as a general matter this year CCAR clearly demonstrates the direction of travel that we want to go in terms of overall capital return. And the scope of what we asked and what otherwise was approved reflects on our commitment to put capital back to shareholders. It's important to note those and as I said in the commentary, our posture has not changed. Meaning as stewards of capital we are looking at and for opportunities where we can invest in an accretive way to generate long-term shareholder return. We're going to continue to do that and you see that in the investments that we're making. Away from that and in excess of it, will continue to return capital back to shareholders. And I think what played out in the context of CCAR is a reflection of what we are comfortable with in terms of what we're going to look to put out given where the market and circumstances are. On the question you raised about FICC, the focus for FICC not borne of this quarter in particular, but since we came on and started to look and re-underwrite the business has been around capital efficiency and equally cost in the context of delivering into our clients. And so that continues to be a focus of ours in terms of the franchise. When you look at FICC in particular, I would say that the business is focused on clients in the context of expanding out the corporates, transaction banking and the like. It's focused on the development of platforms, the investment in those platforms such as Marquee, on-pricing engine and investment grade credit equally the e-commodities business and equally having the talent to be good calibrators of risk intermediating which is at the core. When we do this and we do this right and it is a core historical competency for the firm. We're going to continue to look at ways of accomplishing that and greater capital and cost efficiency. MichaelCarrier: Okay, thanks and then just a follow-up question, just on this strategic review. I think there's a lot of focus on just sort of the revenue opportunities and where you guys are focused. Just given some of the investments and in the longer term to focus on the efficiency ratio, just wanted to get an update or run through some of the initiatives that are in place, and the progress you guys are making to lower the cost base and over time and improve the efficiency ratio. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So I would -- I'll answer that in kind of two components. One is that the new business is being built whether that's the consumer business, credit card business is a part of it or transaction banking. Those businesses are intended to be built as scale businesses, meaning the compensation component attached to that is lower. You have cost and investment made such that the marginal margin in those businesses is operating at full scale continues to grow. And so you achieve greater efficiency on a higher revenue number that comes in. That's the way I would describe the newer initiatives. The second component is what we're doing in and around the introduction of platforms and technology to our standing incumbent businesses. I just mentioned a few examples of what we're doing in FICC and in the securities business more broadly. These two are lowering the throughput of trades, it's lowering the ability or I should say the price point to engage with clients where they want to meet us, which is it's less human capital, it's more platform driven; it carries higher efficiency to it and that's the direction of travel. I'd also say equally true about the incumbent businesses part of what we're doing in the Federation to support the businesses, including in places like compliance is the deployment of technology in order to render us more efficient such that we can support the businesses in a much more cost-efficient way than where we've been historically. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. StevenChubak: Hey, good morning. So appreciate the color on the stress capital buffer, certainly the 5.5% reinforces the strength of your capital position. Given your current ratio are 70 to 120 basis points above that you're likely to create additional capital over the next four quarters. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about sizing the appropriate management buffer? And maybe just philosophically what are some of the factors that will impact that calculus? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think part of the calculus is the direction of travel right of where these regulations are. What the final SCB ruling looks like; equally there are inevitably variability that comes in fluctuation in CCAR results and the way in which stress is imposed. So we will maintain a buffer that's sort of mindful of those very abilities in the overall calculus itself. In terms of the general direction of capital sort of philosophically, it is -- it really is what I had laid out earlier and that is I think you should take the results in this CCAR in particular what we petitioned and what was left un-objected to by the Fed. As the direction we'd like to go. We've got a lot on our plate in terms of investments that are being made, but we're quite confident under the circumstances of being able to put a reasonable amount of capital back. And I'd also point out that the dividend increase for this third quarter now approved by our board is a 47% jump in the dividend, which is also a reflection of the confidence in the increasing durability and profile of the revenues of the firm. StevenChubak: Thank for that Stephen. And just one more for me on efficiency. You size the $1.3 billion investment in some of the newer initiatives, given you noted that investment spend will likely peaked in 2019 maybe the early part of 2020, I was hoping you could speak to whether we should expect to see some efficiency progress as early as 2020. And what's a reasonable expectation in terms of the marginal margin? I know the newer initiatives are tougher to assess, but maybe on some of the legacy businesses given some of the changes you plan to implement on the platforms there. Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, look, obviously the efficiency ratio is in one part of function of revenue. So we'll see where the fortunes of the front take us. On the expense base, I think in the near term there is sort of quick to be realized certain cost efficiencies in our trading costs, meaning what's happening on platforms that are introduced that underpin incumbent businesses that are not looking for, if you will, new flows to command, but we're transacting with clients in a different manner and form than what we've done in the past, just one really small example. If you look at our investment grade business and you look at the bond pricing engine, we can then play both sides of a risk trade in a way that would have taken thousands of man-hours right in order to compute. You would have had inefficiency in terms of its time value. Now we're able to provide a platform where the client can engage and look to conform and develop a portfolio on a much more efficient basis cost sufficient basis than what has happened in the past. So I think there's sooner efficiency or I should say efficiency to be realized sooner in the context of platforms underpinning incumbent businesses. There'll be a longer timeframe as you note in the context of realizing efficiency and some of the newer initiatives that we're building. Operator : Your next question is from the line of wives of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. BetsyGraseck: Hi, good morning. A question on how you're thinking about consumer or credit? And I asked the question for two parts. One is the upcoming Applecart and then the markets portfolio. And on the Applecart, I know you can't go through details, we put some estimates together in a note recently where again based on a lot of assumptions, I end up with an expectation that you're running it about that you would expect to run somewhere around a 1% ROA. Now that's again a lot of assumptions but it's based on the information that's out there on lower rates for the credit quality versus peers, what peers are charging and no fee. And I --the nut of my question is how are you thinking about consumer lending? Is it a business that you think is inherently more risky than your current business which is running at about a 1% ROA? Or do you -- do I have it wrong? What am I missing? And should this be a business that generates higher than a 1% ROA, that's basically another question. Stephen Scherr : Sure, thank you. So let me start by saying there's no denying that the consumer business whether card or Marcus is a risk business, meaning no matter that it's delivered digitally or that the credit card will take a different digital sort of profile than traditional credit cards, this is a risk business and that's where our focus is. I would say the risk is not just on credit risk and financial risk, but equally operational risk in the context of what we're building. And so we're quite conscious on all of those elements. What's important for us is that we look at this on a risk-adjusted return basis not simply on a return on asset construct. And that's what's critical and that's the way we're looking at it. It would be Betsy for me premature to sort of speculate what the pace of growth looks like on this. I would simply say that risk calibration risk decisions in and around the part belong entirely to Goldman Sachs as the bank. And we're set up to make those. I'd also say that if you look at the level and rate of growth in the Markus loan business, while it continues to grow and perform well, we have slowed the increasing growth in that in contemplation of taking on increasing consumer credit through the card business. So we look at it both in its totality, so each is marginally different in a way in which credit is dispersed. But this is a risk business and we'll continue to look at it as we grow it out on a risk-adjusted return basis. BetsyGraseck: So on really that follow-up has to do with the expected at scale efficiency be that you think you're going to be running these businesses at when they're at scale, given the fact that you did a new build, should I be thinking about the efficiency and of these businesses in line with FinTechs which run at intermediate expense ratio that's 30% of other legacy competitors? Or should I look to bank competitors as a more reasonable expense ratio or somewhere in between? Stephen Scherr : I would say that while we've been in beta now for a couple of months and have grown the portfolio on that basis, it's nowhere near yet the scale of what our expectations would be as we grow it out. And so it would be premature for me to kind of speculate as to the efficiency. We'll start to reflect more on that once we launch and once we start to build this portfolio out. So it's a little early. What I can tell you is that what we have built jointly with Apple both on the front end and on the back end is intended to be operationally resilient, but equally is intended to be efficient both in terms of the delivery the app, I should say the application all through the delivery and on the backend and so my expectation is that the efficiency will be reflected in that, but again premature to sort of put numbers around it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. MichaelMayo: Hi, to continue on the investment spend, as it relates to expansion of markets outside the US, where do you stand with the additional countries and what else might you consider? Stephen Scherr : So I think on that Mike, the press has been sort of ahead of our plans in the context of speculating sort of the next country in which Marcus would expand. Obviously, our first place outside the United States was in the UK where the deposit platform has really exceeded our expectations in terms of what it's been capable of generating. There will be opportunities for us to expand in that market. There's been quite a bit of speculation about Germany. It's not surprising that the speculation goes there both in the context of a growing business that we have in continental Europe and the depth of the deposit market in Germany. But it's too early to forecast as and if and when we would expand there though I understand the speculation on that. So for the moment we've got a lot on our plate in terms of the execution around the platform in the United States and in the UK and we'll continue to pursue that. MichaelMayo: All right and then one follow-up unrelated question. 1MBD did you take any additional reserves for that? What's the status? There's a new statement by the head of the SEC on July 3rd saying that it might be a little bit easier to resolve these sorts of matters? What's your take on all this? Stephen Scherr : So just on the reserves, we took incremental legal reserves this quarter of $66 million. We don't give detail on what the elements of that reserve are. I would say that we are adjusting our RPL to $2.5 billion from $2 billion where it was. I should point out that in providing that number to you it's important to recognize that number is our best estimate as of this date. It will be published in the Q events that may play out between now and the Q could alter that RPL. And again there are different accounting regimes and thresholds that apply; one probable, one possible, possible relating to the RPL. And so that's what I can offer you by way of what's happened financially. In terms of statements otherwise being made, I think it would be inappropriate for me to sort of speculate on what others intend by statements they make. I think as we've said in the past, we're in a cooperative engagement with the authorities. We intend to stay that way and as and when there are further developments, we'll be in a position to talk about that a bit more. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. KianAbouhossein: Hi. I have two questions. The first one is related to your equity revenues which were clearly very strong. Also gain some PS reporting so far. And I just want to understand where that's coming from? Because clearly the drivers are more muted such as volatility is down on the equity derivative world. Transactions a volume are okayish, but nothing in terms of the numbers that you have shown in terms of year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter rates. Can you just give a bit more color of where the drivers are? And do you see market share movements in this area? And secondly just coming back to your FICC business. We've now heard from you over the last 12 to 18 months in expansion and more liquid products and traditional client base. And can you bit more detail on the FX and rates expansion both on clients and products? And when should we see actually some of those investments having an impact on your revenue base? Because I don't see you yet outperforming appears in this area, but clearly would be great to get an understanding if you are -- if you feel differently and why and what investments you're doing in order to close the gaps in those two sec? DavidSolomon: So I'll start with equities. I make a broad comment on FICC and Steven will give you a little bit more detail. I--we were very pleased with the performance of equity franchise broadly. The performance really was across the franchise. It was throughout derivatives in cash, I would say given the market dynamics broadly, there's some sense of consolidating share and I think we've been benefit of that and as we've been stating on this call and over the handful of the last quarters, we continue to make the investments in our low touch activity or our low touch capabilities, and we're starting to see some benefits from those investments in our low touch capabilities. With respect to FICC, broadly I do want to highlight as was highlighted I think on page 5 of the presentation, our business is 90% market intermediation, a much higher component of market intermediation than the people that we compete or we benchmark against. So if you have a 60/40 mix and market intermediation is softer, which it clearly was given the environment we had this quarter, your NIM portion or your non market intermediation portion has less volatility, but we continue to make investments as you highlight in some of these products and particularly in broadening out the client base, I'd ask Stephen to provide just a little bit more detail on how we think some of that's point through. Stephen Scherr : Thanks David. So just a pivot to FICC and to be direct to your question. If you look at FX and rates and part of the progress that we were making is on broadening out the client franchise to more corporates than to the institutional clients to which we typically, if not exclusively have engaged. And we're starting to see some early progress in that. I would say in this quarter in particular within Europe. I'd also say that as part of an effort to expand out and penetrate further the corporate base around FX and rates, we're seeing some benefit come to us by way of the joint venture between banking and FICC, where banking obviously owns an entry point into the corporates and the ability to carry through those products into the corporate franchise, where we have a demonstrably strong set of relationships, I think will bear dividend. What's more I would say that if you look at a variety of different initiatives and builds including transaction banking or corporate cash management, this once built and will carry the potential to bring forward a more captive FX business that didn't exist inside the firm. I think that too could prove to be a benefit and just on that particular project Goldman Sachs is already a customer, if you will, of our own platform and we aim to bring customers and clients on in across 2020. And so we're seeing early signs of progress on this, but there's no running from the observation you make which is we have yet to sort of perform at the potential we're confident this business can show. We're very confident in unlocking that potential. Some of these new initiatives will no doubt take a little bit of time before they bear out, but the direction we're moving is a positive one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. BrennanHawken: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. NII as a portion of the I&L debt portfolio, could you maybe help us think about rate sensitivity there? Depending on how you calculate NIM, if it's a 360 or 365 day count NIMs down either a few or upper single digits bps quarter-over-quarter. What are the benchmark rates, gents, predominantly in that portfolio we should watch? How much of the strong NII growth that you guys have seen over the past few years has been balanced versus rate? And then how should we think about how the softening rate environment might impact NII growth going forward? Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that question is to just point out where we differ, if you will, from some of the bigger commercial banks. In the context of both, we have a different liability mix and equally a different composition to our assets. On the liability side, there's a portion of our funding that's fixed to portion that's floating. And so it's not as dynamically correlated, if you will, to the way in which rates otherwise move.  And I think our NII growth generally speaking will benefit from a liability mix that's starting to skew towards deposits. And so that's the perspective I would offer on the liability side. On the asset side, much of the assets that we have are floating rate based and equally and importantly is a higher velocity term to the assets that underlie this. And that too has a more or leads to a more muted impact to what otherwise might see in some of the bigger commercial banks as a function of the direction in which rates are moving. BrennanHawken: Okay and then the part on how much we've seen as far as rate or NIM improvement versus balances last year's? Is it possible to break that down or is that some might have to follow up? Stephen Scherr : I think I would encourage you to follow up sort of with for an answer that's more precise than one I can give you now. I would say that some of this has to do with balances in terms of the size and scope recognizing that the lending that we're doing which is generating this net interest income is quite strategic in the context of the clients that are served by the lending itself. And I'd also point out as I did in the remarks that about 82% of this is secured financing. And so I offer that to you but Heather and the team can provide you with greater insight onto the particulars. Operator : Your next questions from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. JimMitchell: Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow up on the fixed-income discussion. Just want to make sure I understand how you get your assumed internal ROE targets in that business. Is it you see it entirely coming from efficiency improvements and expanding the footprint into more flow business or is there some component of capital that comes out whether it's derivatives or something else? Do you need to see the level of capital decline as well or can it come from those other ways? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So the way we've been looking at it as we've been scrutinizing and re underwriting that business is we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator of the ROE calculation, meaning it's important that nobody lose focus that we need to mind how much revenue is coming in, i.e. how do we want to define the tangible market that we face. What's the revenue capture that we can take in? What's the expense as an offset to that revenue to establish the numerator in the calculus? And none of that is to ignore capital efficiency in the context of what the denominator contains. So this is really as we've talked about it a wholesale re-underwriting of the business, but be assured both of these are in scope in the context of the way in which we're looking at the business. Both revenue net of expense and looking at capital and the revenue being driven largely by an ambition to have a more expansive addressable market to include corporates in addition to that which we otherwise have focused on historically. JimMitchell: And as you pull that capital out it, did you worry at all there's any kind of revenue risk in that pivot to a lower capital or denominator or do you feel that's not really the case? Stephen Scherr : No. I mean, listen, this never is kind of a linear calculus, okay. So the business is for us in FICC are not themselves four-walled, meaning anything we do with respect to a business and FICC has knock-on implications for businesses that sit outside the securities business. Take for example whatever it is we decide to do around credit or commodities, it has knock-on implications. So the thread on the adjacency of all of our businesses gets pulled. So we're mindful of that and need to take stock of what we do around capital. The one other thing I would point out, which I've talked about publicly before is in addition to thinking about both the numerator and the denominator. Embedded in the numerator is equally an effort to sort of optimize our own funding, meaning how do we bring our cost of funds down, retail deposits has been an example of that, but our treasury team is working hard both in terms of the amount of liquidity we run with? How that liquidity is managed in addition to identifying more efficient, lower-cost funding sources in order to render these businesses more competitive. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. DevinRyan: Great. Good morning, David and Stephen. First question just on the United Capital with the deal closing, just look to maybe get a little more perspective on how you're thinking about the business opportunity. I guess broadly and as it connects with Ayco is there a bigger appetite to expand into the mass affluent segments whether it be adding financial advisors or more M&A? Or does United Capital really give you just a big enough footprint to achieve what you're looking to do in the business especially with Ayco? DavidSolomon: Sure. I appreciate the question. We're excited actually, today, I believe we're closing the United Capital acquisition on this very day. And obviously it brings with us our 220 RIAs and 90 offices around the United States. And what it's really doing is we think we have a very, very interesting channel to continue to build the mass affluent segments through Ayco. But this particular transaction accelerates our ability to do that between Ayco and United Capital of $80 billion of assets under management that's a good base from which you grow from. We think we can continue to make progress in what we'll call the $1 million to $5 million of investable assets mass affluent wealth management category through this channel. And that we can have good growth with the extended platform we now have. But if another opportunity came up that we sought to further accelerate it because this is still a very fragmented business, and we have a very, very big infrastructure, so we can continue. The fee in terms of all the wealth, in terms of all the asset management and wealth management products, we have in our asset management business, we'll consider it. This was not something, this acquisition was not something that was targeted for a year that we were really running after it, it came up for sale, we looked at it, we thought it was a really good fit to accelerate our business. And so we decided to act on it. DevinRyan: Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then just a follow up just to think about the third party alternative capital fundraising. Any expectations on whether it could be trajectory or cadence of how we should be thinking about that just as we're sort of think about modeling it? DavidSolomon: Yes. I appreciate the question, Devin. I know that you're all anxious to model it. Over time, we will provide a lot more transparency on how we see that plan went out. As you would expect, we have a lot of businesses across the firm we put them together. And the first thing you do when you put those people together is you task them to develop plans on a go-forward basis. And we are in the process of that and as those plans come forward we will be more communicative and transparent as to what expectation we think you can have with that business over time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. GerardCassidy: Thank you. Good morning. In your comments on the debt underwriting you mentioned deal flows in the quarter were consistent with the trends across the industry, which reflected material lower volumes in the loan market and M&A activity area. And you specifically cited it was with the financial sponsors. Can you share with us what are the financial sponsors seeing today? What do you think will stop them from doing more deal activity in the quarter? And any outlook for the second half of the year from those financial sponsors? DavidSolomon: Well, look, at a high-end there's now -- at a high level, there is no question that activity has been more muted. I guess when you think about the cycle and you think about the continued run at equity markets and the accommodative monetary policy we have which is certainly inflated for assets, it's steady, it's been tougher more competitive, you have to pay more in order to succeed. I also think the financing environment in particular the SNIP regulatory overlay, it has some impact over this cycle and muting how far the private equity activity they have moved in this cycle has a regulatory environment been difference. That said the private equity investors still have an enormous arsenal of unspent capital big reserve. And I think this business continues that secular growth and so as the environment evolves, I think there will be periods of time where we will see increased activity versus what we've seen in the first half of the year. I don't think we have a great explanation of this specifically has done it. I mean if you think about what the first and a half of the year has brought in terms of the macro overlay, it's not surprising probably that it's not a little bit more muted. GerardCassidy: Very good and then as a follow-up on slide 12 you give us your balance sheet of course the allocation. And you mentioned that in the quarter there was a $20 billion quarter-to-quarter increase reflecting client demand to use your balance sheet. Can you share with us the total loans or total assets what percentage of it is clients using your balance sheet? And then second and when you look at the revenues those customers bring to you as a percentage of those assets where those stand and how is that compared to about a year ago? DavidSolomon: So as always the fluctuation in the balance sheet is a reflection of our ability to respond to opportunities and the interest of our clients. And so balance sheets fluctuation is all a function of client service. It's hard to decompose the balance sheet to say what's client -what not, what is not client. Truth, we know all of it, right, is in some manner or form related to client activity and across all of our businesses in the firm. And so that's really the way I would view to the balance sheet both in terms of growth size and its composition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. BrianKleinhanzl: Yes, thanks. Just one quick question. On the market we saw that the rate pay came down towards the end of the quarter, kind of can you just walk through what your -- how you came up with that decision to lower the rate size just looking at the Fed Funds futures. Should we expect more rate cuts there and kind of what's been depositor behavior -- Stephen Scherr : Sure. So we made a decision and it was the first since we began our retail deposit business. We made an adjustment downward. We did it in the context of rendering ourselves competitive in light of what others had done. It's also worth noting at or around the time we reduced the rate we saw others in the competitive set reduce the rate as well. We saw no material adverse reaction to our movement, no to the pronounced outflows nothing to really call attention to. I think you should assume that we will be fluid and flexible and agile in rate movement up or down relative to where the competitive set is. And will sort of comport ourselves that way both in our US platform and in the UK. End of Q& A Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise enjoy the rest of your day. And we look forward to speaking with you in October. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2019. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high-level review of our financial performance and the operating environment, he\u2019ll then provide a brief update on several strategy items including key investments we are making to drive future growth, the significance of the Applecart launch, specifically, as it relates to other technology innovation at the firm and recent personnel changes to align with our longer-term strategic priorities. Stephen will then cover third quarter results across each of our businesses. They\u2019ll be happy to take your questions after that.  I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019m happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. We reported third quarter 2019 revenues of $8.3 billion, down 6% versus last year. Net earnings were $1.9 billion, resulting in an earnings per share of $4.79. Year-to-date, we produced an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11%. Our business performed well against an uncertain geopolitical backdrop characterized by increased volatility and shifting client\u2019s sentiment. A few highlights worth mentioning. In investment banking despite lower results versus a strong third quarter in 2018, we continue to have the world\u2019s leading franchise, ranking Number 1 in global announced and completed M&A and Number 1 in equity underwriting year-to-date. In ICS, we generated year-over-year growth demonstrating the breadth of our client footprint, including progress across both fixed income and equities. We produced record net interest income in debt investing and lending, which annualizes to $3.6 billion. In Investment Management, our assets under supervision increased by over $100 billion to another record of $1.8 trillion, and we generated record quarterly management and other fees. Lastly, we successfully launched a new and innovative credit card with Apple. Turning to Page 2, the operating environment in the third quarter remained mixed and slowed the pace of activity by many of our corporate clients. During the quarter, trade war concerns contributed to a risk-off sentiment and sharply lower global interest rates, particularly in  August. Markets were also impacted by turmoil in Argentina, Brexit headlines in Europe, and a temporary spike in oil prices in September. Throughout the quarter, responses from central banks, including the Federal Reserve and ECB, remained accommodative supporting both capital markets and the sustainability of global economic growth. Looking forward, our economists continue to expect global GDP growth in excess of 3% for this year and next. That said, global growth is not without risk as trade issues remain challenging.  In Europe, growth is decelerating in part due to trade and manufacturing weakness with notable challenges in Germany. In China, while trade has been a headwind, both monetary and fiscal stimulus support growth estimates of roughly 6%. Here in the U.S., growth continues to run at about 2% with strong labor markets, low inflation and healthy wage growth. Economic conditions have also been bolstered by the Fed\u2019s two mid-cycle rate cuts. Importantly, in monitoring the data, consumers continue to show resilience and remain a meaningful source of strength in the U.S. economy. That said, recent data suggest slowing manufacturing and industrial production. Mindful of that, we remain vigilant of where we are in the economic cycle and conscious of it as we manage risk across our firm. In my regular conversations with CEOs, there is considerable focus on the duration of the current economic cycle. While most CEOs remain focused on growing their businesses and capturing opportunities amid the disruptive forces of new technologies, geopolitical issues continue to give rise to some caution. That said, equity valuations remain relatively high. Financing markets are generally open and attractive to issuers, particularly given the low-rate environment and historically low borrowing costs. In addition to corporates, financial sponsors remain active with significant capital to deploy.  Switching gears, I'd like to spend a moment discussing our ongoing strategic investments; a topic Stephen has covered in prior calls and will expand on in a moment. These investments reflect our deliberate and disciplined approach in building new scalable businesses to serve a broader set of clients, including our markets consumer business, the recently launched Apple Card and a new transaction banking platform. Our broader consumer business \u2013 on our broader consumer business, we are very pleased with our progress in building a modern digital consumer bank. Our competitive advantage is that we have no legacy, branch or technology infrastructure avoiding channel conflicts, and yet we are a bank with a sizeable balance sheet and a well-recognized brand, which is needed for successful disruption. Our strategy is to acquire customers under our own proprietary brand and to leverage Goldman Sachs relationships to embed our products into the eco-system of our partners. In three short years, we have raised $55 billion in deposits on our market\u2019s platform; generated $5 billion in loans; and have built a new credit card platform and launched Apple Card in partnership with Apple and MasterCard, which we believe is the most successful credit card launch ever.  In addition, we're making a number of important infrastructure enhancements across our incumbent businesses to better serve our clients and to operate more efficiently. These include investments in our institutional client platform Marquee where we have seen strong growth to over 50,000 monthly active users and over 1 million API data requests every day. We are also investing to develop the next generation of electronic trading platforms in both FICC and equities. Taken together, these investments draw on our returns in the short-term, but are critical to expanding our capabilities and our competitive position, and we believe we\u2019ll be highly accretive in the medium-to-longer term. Next, let's discuss the recent Apple Card launch, which was an outstanding effort by the teams involved. Since August, we\u2019ve been pleased to see a high level of consumer demand for the product. From an operational and risk perspective, we\u2019ve handled the inflow smoothly without compromising our credit underwriting standards. Beyond the launch, we are proud of the successful platform build, which was completed in short order. This is a testament for the quality of engineering at Goldman Sachs and the collaborative engagement of our business and control functions in developing, building, and launching a true platform business. This success positions us to attract top-notch engineering talent as our most recent technology hires demonstrate and to execute our plan to build digital platforms across firm. Before passing over to Stephen, I would like to take a moment to talk about some of the recent leadership changes across the organization. As a management team, John, Stephen and I are very focused on creating opportunities for the next generation of leaders at Goldman Sachs. As we set forth an ambitious long-term strategic plan for the firm, it is natural point in time for some of this transition to occur. We are fortunate to have an exceptionally people with talent as many of our new business leaders are also 15 or 20-year veterans of the firm, and as we execute this transition, we invigorate and empower leaders across the businesses in the federation. Going forward, I am confident that we have an outstanding team in place to serve our clients and achieve the long-term strategic goals we are setting. Lastly, I would like to briefly address our upcoming strategic update. We\u2019ve been actively working to finalize the date and the format for our strategic review and will provide additional details to the market in the coming weeks. Our target timing remains late January. I look forward to that session as an opportunity for us to engage with you on a number of topics, including our strategy, investments in new initiatives, forward plans across each of our businesses and a variety of other key issues. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen to walk through the results in each of our businesses. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David. As David noted at the start, our franchise performance was solid this quarter against a mixed backup in the market as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities. Let\u2019s move through the numbers in detail. Starting on Page 4, Investment Banking produced net revenues of 1.7 billion, down 9% versus the second quarter and down 15% versus a strong year-ago quarter. Financial Advisory revenues of $716 million were down 22% versus last year. Our performance is consistent with a roughly 20% decline across the industry and the number of M&A transactions completed during the quarter as measured by deals over $500 million in value, which as a category is an important driver for revenues. That said, we advised on 8 of the 10 largest M&A transactions this quarter and continue to demonstrate a strong leadership position. Year-to-date, we participated in more than $1.1 trillion of announced transactions and closed on just over $1 trillion of deal volume contributing to our Number 1 M&A league table rankings. Looking forward, as David noted, the ingredients for continued M&A activity remains solid. Client dialogues are healthy, financing markets are open and we continue to see active interest across sectors, including natural resources and healthcare. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $385 million declined meaningfully versus a strong second quarter, which included a number of significant IPOs and were down 11% versus last year. Year-to-date, we ranked Number 1 globally in equity underwriting supported by nearly $50 billion of deal volume across more than 280 transactions. While the recent market reception for certain companies has been less favorable, over the long term, we believe investors will continue to invest in growing, innovative, and disruptive businesses that create value for customers and shareholders. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $586 million, down 7% from a year ago reflecting a decline in industry-wide leverage financed transactions and in-line with a decline in M&A related financings. Nonetheless, our franchise remains well-positioned evidenced by our Number 2 high-yield league table ranking year-to-date. Against the backdrop of the quarter's performance, it is important to point out that our Investment Banking backlog increased versus the second quarter as we saw improvements in both advisory and financing. Given our healthy levels of strategic dialogues, our expanding client footprint, and the nature of our corporate relationships, we continue to be optimistic that our clients will remain active in executing transactions supported by well-functioning and liquid capital markets. Moving to Institutional Client Services on Page 5, net revenues were solid at $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by growth across our diversified FICC and equities businesses, and as David noted at the start, reflective of progress made across our businesses in terms of our clients and business mix and the development of electronic platforms. FICC client execution net revenues were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year, driven by higher client activity in a mixed operating environment. Four of our five FICC businesses posted higher net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model and improved diversification of our business mix. Our rates franchise generated solid client activity in both the U.S. and Europe and saw increased hedging flows from corporate, pension, and insurance clients amid the significant rally in government bonds. In commodities, our business was diversified and produced higher net revenues on higher activity in natural gas and power, as well as in oil, where we supported clients during the September price volatility. We also delivered solid performance in credit and mortgages where net revenues increased amidst improved activity from our broadening client base. These results reflect our continued focus on improving the velocity of risk inventory supporting more efficient capital management in the business. Lastly in currencies, net revenues declined driven by a more difficult geopolitical backdrop in emerging markets as volatility in Latin America and in particular Argentina offset strong performance in Europe.  As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we were investing to expand our capabilities to automate workflows, serve our clients electronically and deliver structured solutions in efficient formats. In our credit business, we are making considerable progress utilizing our systematic platforms to efficiently price, risk manage and execute trades. For example, this quarter, we executed a number of sizable trades in U.S. investment-grade credit providing key financial and insurance clients access to our broad risk intermediation capabilities. Additionally, we recently enhanced our electronic execution capabilities for commodities by leveraging the infrastructure of our Marquee platform. These efforts ultimately improve client experience, execution and pricing, while at the same time, provide us access to serve a broader client base on a more cost-efficient basis. Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the third quarter were $1.9 billion, down 6% sequentially from a robust second quarter, but up 5% versus a year ago. Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were flat versus a year ago as stronger cash results offset lower derivative revenues. Net revenues from commissions and fees were $728 million, up 8% versus a year ago aided by higher client activity. Security services net revenues of $468 million were up 7% year-over-year. Over the course of 2019, we continue to benefit from new prime balances and a rebound in average balances.  Moving to investing in lending on Page 7, collectively, our activities in I&L produced net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter. Given market movements, particularly in certain public investments, it was a very clear divergence in the performance of equities relative to debt securities and loans. Our equity investments generated net revenues of $662 million, down significantly versus last year, driven in part by a reduction in market value on our public investment portfolio. As we discussed on our last call, we hold a number of publicly traded equity investments with customary lockups following IPOs. Our public portfolio currently includes large investments in Uber, Avantor, and Tradeweb. These three positions, in particular, saw significant price pressure during the quarter and were the primary drivers of the $267 million of mark-to-market loss in our public investment portfolio. Taken together, these investments continue to represent approximately 40% of our $2.3 billion public investment portfolio. The performance of our private investment portfolio was also lower versus last year, but showed positive results and continued to perform well, given the diversity of our investments. Private equity net revenues of $929 million were driven by strong underlying corporate performance and events such as sales or additional capital raises. Against that strength and performance, our private investment portfolio was also burdened by certain negative revaluations, including an approximately $80 million mark associated with our position in the [We] company. Turning to Page 8, net revenues from debt securities and loans were $1 billion and included $891 million of net interest income and modest mark-to-market gains. Our total loan portfolio was approximately $100 billion, up approximately $2.5 billion sequentially with the increase driven by loan growth across the portfolio, and we note as we have in the past, that 84% of our total loan portfolio remains secured. Our provision for loan losses was $291 million, up $77 million versus last quarter, driven by idiosyncratic impairments. Importantly, provisions related to our Marcus portfolio were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Our firm-wide net charge-off ratio decreased by 10 basis points to approximately 50 basis points and remains relatively low. While credit costs continue to normalize from this cycle\u2019s low levels, our overall credit exposure remains appropriately sized.  On Page 9, turning to investment management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the third quarter, driven by our diversified global asset management business and leading private wealth franchise. Net revenues included record management and other fees of $1.5 billion, which were up 5% versus last year, reflecting continued growth in assets under supervision. We also saw significantly lower incentive fees and modestly lower transaction revenues from our PWM client trading activity versus a year ago. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.8 trillion, up by $102 billion versus the second quarter, driven by $86 billion of net inflows and $16 billion of market appreciation. The $86 billion of net inflows included $58 billion from the acquisitions of S&P's Investment Advisory Services business and United Capital; $12 billion from organic long-term net inflows, primarily from alternative investments and fixed income; and $16 billion of organic liquidity inflows. Now, let me turn to expenses on Page 10, our total operating expenses of $5.6 billion were roughly flat versus the third quarter of last year. This reflected lower compensation expense concurrent with lower revenues and higher non-compensation costs. On compensation, as I have said in the past, our philosophy remains to pay for performance. The reduction in the year-to-date ratio to 35% is a reflection as always of our best estimate of the appropriate accrual for the firm, which for the full-year 2018 was just below 34%. Also, as we have noted previously, as we grow more platform-driven businesses, we expect compensation to decline as a portion of total operating expenses making our total efficiency ratio a more relevant metric for the firm. Platform businesses should carry higher marginal margins at scale and be less reliant on compensation.  As David discussed earlier, we continue to invest in a number of important initiatives across the firm both to build new businesses and digital platforms, as well as to enhance the firm's infrastructure. To provide you some measure of that investment, a meaningful driver of the year-to-date growth in non-compensation expenses relates to firm-wide technology spending and expenses related to four key projects, Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital. We continue to expect the depth of that investment cycle will be in 2019 though investment spending will continue into the future years. Year-to-date, the total pre-tax impact of our organic projects, Marcus, Apple Card and Transaction Banking is approximately $450 million, resulting in a drag of roughly 60 basis points on our ROE. As these businesses scale over the coming years, we expect this drag to reverse becoming accretive to the firm's ROE. For the year-to-date, our efficiency ratio was 66.2%, up 200 basis points versus a year ago, driven by lower revenues and ongoing investments, partially offset by lower compensation expense. Next on taxes, our reporting tax rate was 22% for the quarter and 21% for the year-to-date. We expect our full-year 2019 tax rate to be approximately 22%. Turning to capital on Page 11. Our Common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.6% using the standardized approach and 13.4% under the advanced approach. The ratios decreased by 20 basis points and 10 basis points respectively versus the second quarter, driven primarily by increased credit risk-weighted assets and roughly 10 basis point impact from our acquisition of United Capital. Our SLR was 6.2%, down 20 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders, including stock repurchases of $673 million and $466 million in common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 369 million shares. Our book value per share was $219, up 11% versus a year ago. We note that our $673 million of share repurchase amount this quarter was less than our $1.75 billion quarterly CCAR authorization. During the quarter, we elected to suspend our open market repurchases as we had begun discussions with certain U.S. governmental authorities with respect to the resolution of the 1MDB matter. We have since resumed our repurchases under an existing 10b5-1 program, and given our incremental disclosures, we are now resuming additional open market repurchase activities as resolution discussions continue.  To be clear, our decision to step away from the market was not motivated by capital concerns as we remain confident in our strong capital position. As this was the first quarter of our fourth quarter CCAR cycle, we will carry forward the unutilized authorization and will continue to balance our priorities of prudent capital management and return of capital in excess of growth investment via share repurchases. Turning to Page 12 for our balance sheet, our balance sheet was just over $1 trillion, up $62 billion versus last quarter, driven by client demand in Repo and equities. On the liability side, deposits increased to $183 billion, including consumer deposits of $55 billion, which more than doubled since last year to become our largest deposit channel. Before taking questions, a few brief closing thoughts. While our third quarter performance was solid given the market backdrop, we continue to invest in driving the firm forward and aspire to delivering high returns in the future. As David discussed, we are executing on a number of fronts and are making real progress across several of our strategic priorities. Overall, our client-centric strategy remains simple and unchanged. First, to serve our clients with excellence thus growing and strengthening our existing business. Second, to diversify our business into adjacent and new areas by expanding our offering of products and services. And third, to operate more efficiently and effectively across the entire firm. As we continue to make progress on our efforts, we are confident that we can deliver leading long-term returns for our shareholders and we look forward to providing a more comprehensive update in January. With that, thank you again for dialing-in. I will now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. Big picture question, during the quarter, you know, we saw the funding markets get all discombobulated, still not standing on their own, we also saw the liquid markets temporally get hurt whether it be recent broken IPOs \u2013 recent IPOs being broken or resetting of some private valuations, so of the big picture of question I have for you is, I'm listening to you talk and you don't sound that concerned like the plumbing's broken. I know we\u2019ve seen these things come and go before, but I just wanted to see if you could talk specifically towards those two big issues and just see if hopefully just overstating a short-term impact on the market? David Solomon : Sure. Thanks, thanks Glenn and I appreciate the question. You know I\u2019d say at a high level, I don\u2019t think the plumbing\u2019s broken, although I do think that you\u2019ve pointed to two places where there are certainly adjustments and changes in evolution. There\u2019s no question that the short-term funding markets experienced a combination of factors that led to the need for some intervention. I would say some of this is market structure and kind of supply and demand, the liquidity in the market and some of it is the impact of regulatory change over a period of time combining with those things. We actually saw some opportunity to work with clients in the context of that and deploy balance sheet, and I think you framed it correctly, there's still work to do to move forward with respect to the short-term funding markets. But I don't think it's fundamentally broken, but I think that will be an evolutionary process of finding the right balance. With respect to private capital formation, you know, again, I think the IPO process is alive and well in the United States. I do think \u2013 or actually globally to put it in that context, I do think that we are going to see a rebalancing of this process of private capital formation, the size and the magnitude of that private capital formation and the period of time with respect to which people get the public markets. I think one of the things that public markets do is, public markets provide discipline and process around companies, and that the public markets are very efficient in doing that, and I think the transparency around some of this private capital formation is going to increase over a period of time not that we are more disciplined against it, but I don't fundamentally think that its broken, I actually think that it\u2019s a healthy adjustment for rebalancing. I\u2019d like Stephen to maybe to make a comment or two around our balance sheet deployment in the context of some of these changes on short-term liquidity, but on the high level, those are the comments I\u2019d make on those two issues. Stephen Scherr : You know Glenn, just to pivot up David\u2019s comments, you know, I would say that we obviously are mindful and watch all of the attending risks that sort of present themselves systemically, near-term, short-term liquidity, what happened in the Repo market is obviously one that we\u2019re focused on. I would say that in our case, as an intermediary, we saw an opportunity to source liquidity and to provide liquidity to clients. And so, for us, this is a lot about the elasticity of balance sheet to serve our clients in terms of what we did in stepping in during dislocation, you know, in the Repo market. It had no negative impact to us from a liquidity point of view. We had sufficient liquidity to do it, but I think from the perspective of our firm, stepping in to serve clients, it was a lot about flexibility and balance sheet and growing balance sheet so as to provide liquidity as an intermediary in the market more broadly. Glenn Schorr : Awesome! I have one little follow up on your comments about the 8K, which I saw on 1MDB. So, I heard a comment on the stopping and starting of the buyback and I saw the $47 million reserve taken, which I think a lot of people would say is not that much, so I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but just how does that make you feel \u2013 should we feel like you're fully reserved for 1MDB? Where are we in the process? What\u2019s your RPL? If you could talk to those issues that\u2019d be awesome. Stephen Scherr : Sure, sure. So, I think you should feel comfortable because we feel comfortable that we've gone through, you know, an appropriate process in assessing both the situation involving 1MDB and other legal matters, and in that context, both with internal and outside counsel. You know we have fixed our RPL and our reserve at the level that the accounting standards require in both of those respects. On the RPL, bearing in mind this number is as good as it is till we get to the 10-Q when it's formally set up, but we have that set now at $2.9 billion. That\u2019s up roughly $300 million from where it was in the last Q. There was, as you pointed out, a modest adjustment in reserves, and in the context, obviously, both carry a very different accounting threshold and standard, one being reasonably possible, the other being probable and estimable, and in that context, we feel comfortable with where we are, you know, given the standing of legal circumstances both relating to 1MDB and otherwise. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. David, as you transition to franchise to your target operating model, is there an ROE flow you'd like to maintain while you\u2019re at the transition phase? I guess is the 9% ROE this quarter are sort of a good way to think about the flow? Or you\u2019re willing to sacrifice, you know, the near-term profitability for the longer-term vision? David Solomon : Thanks for the question, Christian and I \u2013 you know I think, I understand, I\u2019d try to put it in, you know what, through the cycle context and also short-term context. If you look at our \u2013 if you look at our, you know, ROE year-to-date, our ROE year-to-date is over 10%. But as Stephen clearly articulated on the call, there has been about a 60-basis point drain on our ROE year-to-date given the investments that we\u2019re making across our three principal projects, the card, our markets digital consumer banking platform and also transaction services. We continue to make investments to drive our firm and the returns of the firm higher in the medium and longer term and we are willing to sacrifice some short-term returns to make these investments, better position and strengthen the franchise and allow us to better deliver for our clients in the long run. Christian Bolu : Great, thank you. And then, Stephen, maybe a couple of questions on the credit provisions, on the impairments, maybe it be more color, I think you mentioned it was not Marcus, so just to be more color on what it was? And then, on CECL, I think you disclosed that the day one here to be somewhere like $400 million to $600 million, of which half of that is about the consumer book, but as we look forward, we think about the Apple Card, broader plans to grow consumer, how should we think about the day two impact? Sort of any ongoing CECL impact through 2020 and beyond? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, maybe I\u2019d take the second part of your question first. In terms of CECL, just to be precise, the guidance we've given is a $600 million to $800 million adjustment. I\u2019d also point out that as the portfolio around Apple Card grows in throughout 2020, obviously we\u2019re building that reserve from, you know, a base of zero as it relates to the credit card portfolio itself. And so, those reserves will be built in the context of the CECL requirements, so there\u2019s no adjustment to reflect in as obviously the reserves are not yet been taken. On the first part of your question, I\u2019d point out that we took $291 million loan loss provision, which itself was up $77 million quarter-over-quarter. That related to a couple of things. One was four idiosyncratic corporate impairments, each of which was less than $30 million, none of which would give rise to any sort of perceptible trend or impact as it relates to the broader portfolio itself. And net charge-off, I think as I noted in the prepared remarks, that ratio was down 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 50 basis points. I\u2019d say as it relates to, you know, the markets unsecured portfolio, the provisions there were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. That portfolio is now performing much more in line with our initial modeled expectations. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about some of the earlier vintages performing at a worst loss rate. Those now have come back in. This is performing more in-line with the model. And so, what\u2019s reflected in the provision is not a reflection of any degradation in that portfolio. I should point out though that, you know, provisions will grow as it relates to growth in the portfolio itself. That includes credit cards, that includes unsecured loans, but there\u2019s no reflection embedded in that to the quality and the performance of the portfolio itself. Operator : Your next question is from line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe the first one, just given the lighter equity I&L revenues in the quarter, you mentioned some of the public, you know, pressures. Can you give us maybe some color on the portfolio in terms of the sector breakdown, maybe the current value versus costs? Just trying to get, you know, some context to some of the pressures that we're seeing on private valuations and if we could see that, you know, kind of, you know, bleeding into the future or, you know, most of that, you know, was right size this quarter? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, let me start with the public portfolio, the public portfolio, I think as I mentioned, has a carry value of $2.3 billion. The names that I had mentioned, Uber, Tradeweb and Avantor comprise about 40% of that portfolio, and those were the largest contributors to the downdraft if you will in the public portfolio itself where we mark those is obviously the observable market less some form of the liquidity discount, particularly in situations where there's a lockup or these are other circumstances that warrant it. In the private portfolio, you know, the size of that I should say is just shy of $20 billion, $19.7 billion and there, we mark as I\u2019ve said in the past, mostly on an event driven basis, meaning, we look at circumstances where there's another round, there's been a sale. We look at the underlying performance of those names and, you know, we make \u2013 we set our marks, you know, in that regard. I\u2019d called out, you know, the [We] company in particular because it obviously got quite a bit of notoriety in the press. As I mentioned, the revaluation there was in the neighborhood of $80 million in terms of our loss. Our carry value there, I should point out, is approximately $70 million, which I would tell you is meaningfully higher than where our embedded cost is in that particular name. So, if there was further downdraft, there\u2019s still embedded profit in the name itself, but I called that out just given the nature of the press and the notoriety around the name itself. Michael Carrier : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And then, just as a follow up, you guys are, you know, fairly significant in the alternative asset managed business. You\u2019ve created some changes, you know, in that platform. Just wanted to get, you know, your perspective on like how you\u2019re thinking about that business going forward in terms of third-party funds? What that could mean for a fee growth? But then also any shift, you know, in balance sheet usage, you know, over time? David Solomon : Sure. Sure, Michael and, you know, I think we talked about this a little bit on the last call, but we see the opportunity for us as a significant manager of alternative assets both for ourselves and for our clients at the time \u2013 at the current time, an opportunity for us to meaningfully grow the client fees that we have. Our teams are working hard at developing a medium and long-term plan. With respect to that growth, we\u2019ll certainly communicate more about that when we have our strategic update and review. But I think it's fair to say that the growth of those assets and the development of that business will happen more over time in the medium or longer-term. As I think we stated publicly before, and we talked last time that we were on the call, we will continue to invest balance sheet capital and people should not see or expect in the short-term a change in with respect to the way we deploy balance sheet, but over time the medium and long-term as we evolve this business and grow other revenue streams, we\u2019ll certainly reconsider that and we evaluate what we think is appropriate. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So, I wanted to just start with a follow up to one of Christian\u2019s earlier questions, it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve been fielding from a number investors as well, which is this concern that you have a long timeline before some of the newer growth initiatives achieve scale, suggesting it could, a lot of time can pass before we actually see the benefits to the P&L. And so, I was hoping you could speak to higher balancing the need to execute on the longer-term initiatives while still delivering improved near-term profitability? And where could that near-term profitability improve and ultimately come from if you could cite a number of the potential sources that would be really helpful? David Solomon : Sure, and I\u2019ll talk about this, and look, this is a balance and I think it starts from the fact that we have \u2013 you know we have an institutional business. We\u2019ve historically had an institutional business that\u2019s very capital market sensitive. We\u2019re taking the opportunity to grow more fee-based durable recurring revenues, but that will take some time and we\u2019re thinking about building those businesses in the medium and long term for Goldman Sachs over a long period of time. We\u2019ve been around for a long time and we look back historically the way we built our asset management business, the way we built our other international business, the way we built our investing businesses. These are businesses we\u2019ve built over a long period of time organically and that is our thought process with respect to a number of these. When you say a long time, you know, a long time is a subjective word. You know we think about getting real contributions from some of these investments that we\u2019re making over the next three to five years, but I understand in the context of short-term catalysts that that might feel like a long time. In the meantime, though, we are very, very focused on our, what I\u2019ll call, short and medium-term performance and we\u2019re particularly focused on efficiency in the organization and where there are cost and efficiency opportunities. And we think over the next 12 to 24 months, we can make meaningful progress on that and when we get a strategic update, we will probably quantify that more specifically. In addition, we are making investments in platforms and some of our clients where we think we will see tangible benefits in the next 12 to 24 months. That can be with respect to footprint expansion, that can be with respect to technology platforms inside our securities business with a lot of better connectivity, you know, to our clients. And so, I think there\u2019s a mix of things that both enhance or move us along in the next 12 to 24 months. And then, we\u2019ve been talking on this call and otherwise about some of what I\u2019ll call the bigger tentpole investments where we will see the benefits over a three to five-year period and we have objectives to build bigger businesses over the next decade. Stephen Scherr : Steven, the one other thing I'll add to David\u2019s comments is around funding optimization and liquidity management, which I think will yield much shorter-term benefit to the firm overall and that work, you know, has already begun. And so, there I'm talking about funding substitution to lower cost retail deposits relative to wholesale. It is being more diligent about overall liquidity management in the firm and sizing liquidity appropriately. I think all of those in addition to what David was speaking about in terms of efficiency and overall operating expenses will be two near-term elements that I think people can look to, you know, in the context of a longer-term profile to some of the bigger investments. Steven Chubak : Thank you both for that helpful color. And just one follow-up for me on the election, certainly encouraging to hear that you're seeing your backlog grow. I was hoping if you could speak about the election certainty, how that\u2019s impacting CEO confidence, and maybe just bigger picture as it relates to some of the growth initiatives given the heightened scrutiny of the private equity business by some of the more progressive candidates? How does that inform your decision to deploy more resources towards that expansion, particularly on the alternative side? David Solomon : Sure, and I appreciate that question and, you know, as you would expect as I travel around and talk to people, people are interested in talking about the election. The election cycle started, but I would just highlight that we are very, very early in the process and I think to speculate on where we wind up with candidates and also depending on which candidates we wind up with, what we wind up in the context of an election, what we wind up in the context of a legislative process after the election and how some of what\u2019s going to get discussed in election cycle turns into policy, I still think there\u2019s a lot of ground cover. We\u2019re building \u2013 to the second part of your question in investment platform for the long run, private investment \u2013 private investment, alternative investment activities, whether it's private equity or credit or infrastructure or growth capital, I think despite the fact that there can be dialogue around evolutions in that business or potential regulation of certain aspects of that, that will not change the opportunity in those businesses for us over a long period of time. In addition, I\u2019d just also highlight that I think one of the virtues of our organization is that we\u2019re agile, nimble, responsive and adaptive. We\u2019ve been around for 150 years. There\u2019ve been a lot of different political regimes. There\u2019ve been lots of evolutions in markets, and I think this organization has always proven that it can adapt and it can respond. And so, we\u2019re watching the environment like everyone else. I think it\u2019s early to draw conclusions, but we\u2019ll always be thinking from both a client standpoint, a strategic standpoint, and a risk management standpoint as we have more information how to best position the firm for returns for our shareholders. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. David Solomon : Hi, good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions, one you cited the deposit is $55 billion, you know, obviously a very large number that you\u2019ve been able to generate over the course of last couple of years in Marcus and others. Just wondering how you are thinking about redeploying that and the growth you are expecting from here into your businesses? Is it all into loans? Or, you know, can you do more than just loans with the deposits? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, thanks Betsy. On deposits, obviously they\u2019ve doubled. Retail deposits have doubled in the year and our anticipation is to continue to grow it across the U.S. and the UK platform by about that $10 billion a year. What that does for us is it enables us to fund a variety of different businesses not limited to loans in the context of that, which sits in the bank. And so, you know, as much as we\u2019re raising deposits, we\u2019re equally mindful of businesses that can be brought into the bank into these so as to avail ourselves for the deposits we\u2019re raising. And so, there are a number of businesses, including our rates business and equally the movement of our FX business, which is much more suited to consume, you know, short-dated retail deposits than longer duration wholesale funding. And so, we are moving more businesses into the bank, both U.S. and UK bank, you know, so as to take advantage of the growth and the more attractive, both term and pricing on those deposits themselves. Betsy Graseck : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, as you think about the reconfiguration of how your, you know, presenting Goldman\u2019s, you know, earnings to the Street in January where does the value of those deposits get allocated? Does that get allocated to a consumer bank? Does that get allocated to, you know, the top of the shop to the federation? Just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking through the value of that deposit creation and who gets credit for that? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, I think it would be a little early to get into that granularity. You know our objective as we get toward the end of the year and certainly at the end of January when we present to the market, you know, our objective is to have enhancement to our disclosure, you know, which will give people a much better sense of how we manage the business, and therefore, how we talk about the business and equally providing all of you, you know, what\u2019s kind of the right lens through which to look at our business more broadly. We've been taking commentary and perspective from investors and from you in the context that where there's been some frustration. I hear it loud and clear on the context of frustration with I&L as an example. And so, you know, we\u2019re going to guide ourselves in the direction of segments, you know, to meet some of what all of you have been asking for and just on that particular issue, you know, I think only to wait till we finalize some of what we do. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Stephen Scherr : Hello. David Solomon : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : If you could just give a little bit more color on the technology investments? I mean you\u2019re your stock trades below tangible book value for a company that\u2019s grown book value twice the pace of the S&P 500 over the last two decades? So, somebody\u2019s not convinced about your investments and the eventual payoff. So, as a side note, you know, how \u2013 when does that drag of 60 basis points to ROE become positive over, you know, how many years? But more importantly, what are the external milestones that we can monitor to see if you\u2019re on track or not? Or do we just have to wait three to five years and say, okay, you made it or not? And in my \u2013 I know in my career I've covered other companies. They say it's on track then five years sometimes 10 years later your go, oops, it didn't work. So, how do we know that you'll be that \u2013 the good version instead of the bad version? And then if you want to add in some governance changes that you're doing, David, it seems like from a tire to be the destination workplace for technologists. David Solomon : Okay. So, there\u2019s a lot there in the question, but let me, Mike, get a couple of things at a high level. And first look, I certainly expect us to be on the good end of what you're saying and one of the reasons that we\u2019re working toward the strategic uptick in January is one of the things that we expect to layout for you is targets that will be held accountable to that can also give you a better sense and more transparency on what we\u2019re doing and how you should hold this accountable over a period of time toward doing it. And I\u2019d just say and I noticed this might be in some way, you know, not moving as fast as you like or not moving as quickly, but the lens I'd like you to consider, you know, looking through as we started on this journey a year ago and in the context of the year, we\u2019re meaningfully increasing the transparency. We\u2019re moving in the direction of doing this and it just takes some time, but I understand the question and the demand that you have that we need to lay out some clear objectives and better metrics and more transparency and I think we\u2019re on our way to doing that. I can\u2019t comment on, you know, why the firm, you know, values us, you know, where it does, but what I do believe that if we continue to compound our book value on both in absolute basis, you pointed out, you know, over 20 years, I\u2019d point out that our book value growth over one-year, three years, five years, 10 years has outpaced the peer set. If we continue to do that over time and if over time because the investments that we make add more fee-based or durable revenue to our business mix and we\u2019re able therefore to move all the turns higher, I do believe over the time the market will reward us. Now, Stephen, do you have anything else that you would add based on some of the questions that Mike laid out? Stephen Scherr : No. I think, Mike, maybe to address the question of timeline, so, you know, not all of these initiatives, you know, operate in the same set of time sequence. So, as an example, I think that consumer initiative is one, you know, that will be over the medium to long term. You know what we've built to this point in three years, you know, is effectively a bank that has $55 billion of the deposits and $5 billion in loans and a new credit card platform that\u2019s begun with Apple, but that can go in a variety of different places and partnerships. I think that will take some time to sort of see that investment payout. Shorter-term, I would say you could look at, for example, transaction banking, where, you know, that platform is one where, as we\u2019ve said several times, we are the first customer. We\u2019re a current customer of that. So right now, you know, we\u2019ve processed more than $250 billion of payments for Goldman Sachs through that platform and equally we are on schedule to bring very consequential corporate clients to the firm onto that platform and I think given the nature of that spend, its ability to borrow on some of the technology that was built on the consumer side, you know, we\u2019ll have a much faster sort of payback, if you will, relative to the longer cycle around consumer. And so, I think these will vary. But David is 100% right. We will present to you metrics by which you should measure us and we\u2019ll hold ourselves to it as we execute along this path. Mike Mayo : And then, just one follow-up then, I mean if you're in Silicon Valley, you\u2019re saying what you're doing is just phenomenal. I mean they\u2019re just saying this is fantastic. If you're a competitor of Goldman, I\u2019d have to say they are not taking this too seriously based on my conversation. So, what is it that your universal bank competitors are under appreciating and by consequence, the shareholders are under appreciating in terms of how they expect the payoff from these investments? David Solomon : I understand the question at a high level, Mike. But what I'd say here is one way to think about it. Over the course of the last three years, we\u2019ve built a digital consumer platform that\u2019s only beginning to evolve that has $55 billion of deposits; it has $5 billion of loans; it is 4 million to 5 million customers. We've also built the first credit card platform at a meaningful period of time and have launched a partnership with it and what we believe is one of the most successful credit card launches, if not, the most successful credit card launch ever. If \u2013 we\u2019ve spent on that, you know, over $1 billion, a little over $1 billion. If you were asked, would you spend $1 billion to get that? You would say, sure, you might spend more. Certainly, someone could have justified our study meaningfully more to kind of acquire that inorganically. We\u2019re very focused on proving what we do over time. I think this firm over time has a good track record of building businesses that are successfully integrated into the firm and really succeed all the time. I pointed this out earlier in the call when I highlighted our asset management business that was built over a long period of time or international business that was built over a long period of time, our investing platforms that were built over a long period of time. And so, we\u2019re focused on proving ourselves over time; we\u2019re focused on our clients and we\u2019re less focused on competitor views on these issues. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, you guys have done some smaller opportunistic deals recently, but with the potential, it sounds like you are closer and in active discussions on 1MDB in putting that behind you, which is great. Once you're able to have clarity on that does that open you up for -- to consider some larger deals? And one place that investors have recently started to focus on would be a discount broker space. It\u2019s been hit recently with the commission cut; it seems to fit with your new strategic direction. And so, when you think about a deal, I know you probably wouldn\u2019t want to talk about anything specific in a particular space, but how would you balance assessing tangible book regulatory capital hits versus long-term growth and maybe attractiveness of low-cost deposits and other benefits like that? David Solomon : Sure, and I appreciate the \u2013 I appreciate the question, Bren, and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, you know, over time. I think one of the things this management team is trying to do is to think broadly both about our organic growth, but also potential opportunities over time for inorganic growth. I\u2019ve said on this call and previous calls, the bar for us to do something inorganically, especially something significant inorganically is very, very high. At the same point, it\u2019s the job of this management team to have a point of view and to be doing work and to be thinking about opportunities that can expand our franchise. The online or the discount brokerage area is not one that we\u2019re particularly focused on. We are focused on the growth of our wealth management business and the wealth management channel through the acquisition of United Capital that we just made, which we think fits very nicely into our Ayco platform and our access to corporation as the unique and differentiated channel through which to access mass affluent wealth. And so, we\u2019re much more focused on the build-out of that of ultimately tying digital capabilities to that and I think that\u2019s in the wealth management area where in the near term you'll see our primary focus. Brennan Hawken : Thanks, David. That\u2019s very helpful color. And then, my follow-up, provisions, you guys spoke bit about it, idiosyncratic which makes sense. One book is largely commercial, so, you know, provision build tends to be idiosyncratic, how should we think about that over time though that portfolio is beginning to season? Should we generally think that the trend is generally upward and do we use this as a starting off point or because, you know, you labeled it idiosyncratic, we should adjust for a bit normalize it and then grow it from there? Is there any color on how to think about that? Stephen Scherr : Well, it\u2019s difficult to predict kind of the forward trend because obviously, you know, we\u2019ll be mindful of where the markets are and what risk looks like in the context of taking on accretive lending opportunities. You know in the last year the run rate of net interest income that we are taking in on the book has gone from $2.8 billion on an annualized basis to $3.6 billion looking at the near $900 million that was generated in the quarter. We\u2019re doing that on the basis of a secured or largely secured book and we\u2019re experiencing very little in the way of NIM compression in the context of, you know, where we\u2019re lending. And so, you know, I would say we\u2019ll be driven by client demand, we\u2019ll be driven by opportunities that are presented more broadly, but we\u2019re going to do it only in the context of ensuring the we\u2019re mindful of risk, we\u2019re embedding appropriate covenants into our lending. We\u2019re lending into a diversified book and we\u2019re trying to achieve as much as we can know, you know, to kind of the 84% secured book, you know, that we\u2019ve been on and I think, you know, you should take that as the general direction we\u2019ll go in terms of overall, you know, corporate lending. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the Apple Card. David, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times that that\u2019s been potentially one of the most successful launches ever. Could you share any kind of \u2013 and I know its early days, but any kind of initial success whether its lending balances, card \u2013 number of cards out there? What kind of trend are you seeing with usage that kind of stuff? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, I\u2019d say a couple of things on the card. We\u2019re not a position to share kind of detailed information about it. What I would tell you though is that we have seen a pretty spectacular reception to the card as a product. The approval rates early on have been lower and I\u2019d say that that\u2019s a decision obviously Goldman Sachs is making as the bank, but we\u2019re doing that in concert with Apple and it is because we\u2019re quite vigilant from a risk point of view, but not being negatively selected out-of-the-box, meaning over time, we\u2019ll start to see better credits appear, the approval rates will go up, but we\u2019ve seen an enormous inbound. We've issued a considerable amount of cards. We've just been through our first bill cycle, which went smoothly. And so, from an operational point of view, it\u2019s gone well. Too early to tell in a shorter period of time as we\u2019ve launched this as to sort of what the revolver transactor mix looks like, it's just too early. But from an operational point of view, from a risk perspective, you know, skewing to the higher side of FICO bands, I think we\u2019re very, very pleased as is Apple with this sort of early month or two or three into this, and, you know, we\u2019ll have more to say as we get further into the development of the portfolio itself. Jim Mitchell : Right, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just switching gears on a follow-up on just sort of the whole efficiency discussion on the legacy business. You talked about whether it\u2019s funding efficiency, expense efficiency. Is there anything left to do on sort of capital efficiency standpoint? Do you see material opportunities there as well to boost returns? Or is it mostly expense and whether its interest expense or? Stephen Scherr : Well, I would say it was in \u2013 I think the opportunity sits across all of the categories to be honest. I mean, you know, you\u2019re never in a position where you should be satisfied that you\u2019re at a static point in capital is always an opportunity to optimize across a range of different businesses and to look to take capital on a consistent basis and deploy it to even higher returns than where its deployed, you know, at any given moment in time. I\u2019d also say that we\u2019re constantly looking, and as David said, we\u2019ll share more with you when we present in January at a fairly aggressive, you know, opportunity set to look at expenses and equally and as I talked about, you know, looking at funding opportunities and liquidity, you know, overall. Some of what we've done, you know, on that score, particularly with as it relates to expenses, is as you know in the context of our front-to-back initiative, which was to take operational and technology resources and put them by in large into the businesses that are consuming what it is that those individuals are up to, keeping back a very central and strong core, both in technology and ops, but part of that is to have the businesses in much better, greater, more proximate control to the expense base in the context of both operations and technology, and we\u2019re going to continue to look around the organization, you know, to do that and in the course of it, you know, lower operational risk and raise our overall efficiency. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes, good morning. I just wanted to get clarification from Steve on two items. One is, when you talked about the pace of investments you said something like that kind of \u2013 or the message I took from it is that kind of you\u2019re at the run rate of investments now and that it doesn't necessarily increase in 2020, was that the right way to interpret that? Stephen Scherr : Well, the way I would consider it is that, you know, the rate of growth is going to decrease, right, in subsequent years on the static book of initiatives that we\u2019re looking. Obviously, there are other opportunities that present themselves that we deem to be accretive to the overall \u2013 you know to shareholder value, we\u2019ll pursue them. But against the book of initiatives that we\u2019re up to, you know 2019 should be the depth of what you see. Chris Kotowski : The depth meaning \u2013 okay. And then, on the buybacks, you know, you mentioned the [673] versus kind of that 1.75 pace that, you know, would have \u2013 one would have assumed from the CCAR, you said you would come or come back into that. I mean does that mean we should expect the pace to go back to 1.75 or are we going to catch up what you weren't able to do this quarter through the rest of the year? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, let me be clear. We pulled ourselves out of the market, you know, in the context of what I had cited, which was discussions on going with respect to 1MDB. On the back of the disclosures that we've made and just an assessment that we always make about the prudence of being in or out of the market on any number of different variables, including 1MDB, we are now back in the market. We\u2019ve been back in the market based on an existing 10b5-1 program that we put so as to avoid the vagaries of being in or out, but equally we\u2019re now in a position to be back repurchasing in the open market. I mentioned that, you know, it was in some sense fortunate that this was the first of the four quarters within the CCAR cycle, therefore, we have the opportunity to carry forward what we did not use in the context of this last quarter, and our intention as we sit here given from a position of capital strength is to continue along, you know, the strategy and philosophy that we\u2019ve had, which is to return capital back to shareholders as into the extent that there\u2019s not other deployment that\u2019s accretive in the context of growth and shareholder value. We\u2019ll continue to do that, obviously now with the benefit of the unused capacity from last quarter now to put against what we can do this quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Great thanks. Good afternoon, David and Stephen. I guess a couple of follow-ups here to some of the newer growth initiatives. In transaction services, you\u2019re testing your own platform. It sounds like that's going well, but I just want to dig in a bit since you\u2019re moving closer to on-boarding clients, so the question is if you can talk a little bit about just the early feedback from customers, and, you know, how you\u2019re framing the competitive advantages, and really just how you expect that business is going ramp, meaning, you know is the expectation that you\u2019re going to win kind of a small piece of customers\u2019 wallets initially and then potentially it could scale from there? Or are you expecting, you know, some chunky mandates early on? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, as I said, we are now using the platform operationally. And so, it's not in sort of small amount testing. We've been through that period. Now, we\u2019re using it, you know, as I said, to tune of more than $250 billion of payments being made for Goldman Sachs. In terms of the forward end clients, you know, we have been engaged as early as the diligence around the idea with a number of very large corporate clients so as to ascertain a couple of things. One, what if they think was missing from that which they are using currently; and secondly, what could we be building so as to satisfy the needs of what they want. Many big corporates have a platform that carries three or four banks on that platform much as our longer-term ambition is to be a major player in the place \u2013 in the space, and to sit in one or two. You know, our early ambition is to be in the three or four slot, and work our way into the platform, and we will start across the five major currencies. What I think and what we're hearing, many large corporates say about the attractiveness of what we\u2019re building is two-fold. One, that the technology fees is much better, much newer, not nearly as manual in terms of reconciliation as what clients have been accustomed to use for technology that largely has not changed over the last many years. Second, in the context of funding and operational deposits, obviously Goldman Sachs is a good buyer of incremental deposits.  We\u2019ve shown that in the context of retail deposits, it will be true around sticky operational deposits and what we\u2019re not intending to lead with cost, you know doubling if you will want big commercial banks are paying in terms of 1 basis point or 2 basis points to sort of 3, 4 or 5 basis points, I can assure you we will be meaningfully accretive to the firm in terms of funding substitution. So, I think a function both of the technology interface, the spend or what we will payout for operational deposits, I think our two elements in terms of what\u2019s driving the attraction of certain corporate clients into what it is that we\u2019re building. Devin Ryan : Thanks for all the color Stephen appreciate it. And then just a follow up here, you know almost exactly a year ago you announced Ayco\u2019s high-profile partnership with Google to provide financial wellness to kind of the entire employee base, I know some of the recent initiatives in the United Capital transaction are going to be synergistic there, is it like David mentioned in the prepared remarks, I'm just curious how you are going to market as you focus more broadly on kind of the full employment employee basis of firms and really whether you are aggressively marketing the platform to some of the larger organizations that I know Goldman has relationships with or if it makes sense to or is there any logic behind trying to connect more into kind of your consumer offering essentially waiting to really push hard so you have a broader platform before you really kind of go through kind of all those relationships that you have on the, at the firm level? Just trying to think about kind of how to gauge what you're doing with kind of the full employee basis of the firms that you're working towards on the wealth management side? David Solomon : Yes. So, I\u2019d say, we obviously think we have a uniqueness distribution channel through Ayco and our corporate relationships as you highlight Devin, and we've started the process of going after that, but I would say we saw a lot of upside, I would say you know the footprint of Ayco\u2019s connectivity to the Fortune 100 is high. The footprint of connectivity to the Fortune 1000 there is an awful lot of upside. And one of the things that the acquisition of United Capital does is it allows us to accelerate the penetration in those corporations and one of those things we've found is if you deliver a good product and service to the top of those organizations or the most senior people in those organizations, the ability then to next step leave it to the organization follows on quite clearly.  So, we see a good opportunity and a lot of upside to expand the channel. That\u2019s why we're very, very focused on it. Over time, I do think as you highlight there can be digital connectivity as we build a more digital two market platform, but that\u2019s still something that\u2019s often the future, and so we continue to focus on really penetrating a broader set of corporate clients where we have good relationships and access to their employee base. Operator : The next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon Stephen and David. David Solomon : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Question I have is, obviously as you guys pointed out in your numbers, your number one year-to-date in global equity underwriting, can you guys give us some color on what your views are about the direct listing that was apparently a big meeting out in California and you probably saw, written about in the third quarter or possibly even in October, but can you just give us your thoughts on the threat to the equity underwriting business possibly from these direct listings? David Solomon : Sure. At a high level I would say that the utility of direct listings and the number of direct listings that we will see over time is still something, but I think there is a lot of question. There have been two direct listings. We\u2019ve participated as a lead advisor on both those direct listings. I think the companies were in some way unusual in the context the way they approached the market, but I still think that whether or not this is the best path or a path that could be open to lots of companies approaching the market is still something that\u2019s questionable. One of the things that the IPO process does generally is, you raise capital and therefore there is a price discovery around creating depth of liquidity because people are actually raising capital. Obviously the two companies have gone through a direct listing process did not need to raise capital. It is interesting to note where those companies are at the current point. We are engaged as others are in dialogue about this. We are very, very open to helping our clients if they are interested in considering a direct listing, and so we are participating actively in those discussions. I'd say, I think the noise around this really disrupting the IPO market or potentially disrupting the economic opportunity for the leading banks like ourselves and a handful of others in the IPO market is overstated at this point, but I do think that they will continue to be evolution in these processes and there are ways that we can so clients better or find ways to get them to market more efficiently. We're certainly willing to do that. I like where we sit as the leading firm or one of the leading firm\u2019s because whether a direct listing or a traditional IPO process, we benefit from both those channels. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and then moving over to the equity markets business, clearly, we\u2019ve all seen on the consumer side, Charles Schwab, Fidelity bring their commission rates down to 0, when we know in cash equities institutional rates have fallen and electronification has helped everybody manage that decline in rates. Do you guys ever envision that we could get to 0 commissions in cash equities similar to what we see in the retail side? David Solomon : Look, I think it is a more complicated equation because I think the leading franchises and the equity business you really have an integrated platform at scale on a global basis that\u2019s providing value in a variety of ways. And it\u2019s very hard to pull that apart entirely. So, the answer to your question is, scale really benefits us and the other people that are in a leading position. It is not just execution, but it is also financing and those things get lumped together. I think it\u2019s unlikely that it goes to 0, but I do think to a degree that is more pressure on commissions, which there has been and they will probably will continue to be. The organization\u2019s that have global scale and ability to use financing and balance sheet as an integrated capability I think should continue to do well. If you actually go back and look at the market share or the wallet share that the top three platforms have over the last 5 years to 10 years, they have actually gained wallet share in that period of time and you could really see the benefit of scale. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes. I just have one quick question. Now you are giving some of the pluses and minuses around expenses and some of the growth investments that you are doing this year, but if you think about it, is it right way to think about this, if you had a flat revenue environment you still should be able to see expenses decline, therefore generate positive operating leverage? Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure. I mean, I think much of the investing we are doing is consuming operating leverage that exist in the business, and the forward initiatives that David and I have talked about in terms of funding rationalization and expense reduction are all initiatives that need and must go on and they will continue to create operating leverage in the business, which will be put toward growth opportunities in the firm or shareholder return in the absence of them. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Couple of questions. When you look at your net interest margin 43 basis points can you kind of parse out, what you get from the markets and what that margin looks like and what the net interest margin looks like in your banking business because as you are growing, the banking side, you should be able to see the margin kind of widen out, and we hadn\u2019t really seen as much of that, so I\u2019ve been kind of counting on that as part of a business mix is that your higher margin business is growing faster and just was wondering if that\u2019s something we should be able to assume over the next year or two? David Solomon : Well. The one thing I would say is, I would be careful to sort of look at NIM across all of our businesses as kind of the relevant metric for how well we are producing. So, for example, it is less relevant metric or element in for example our trading business. Rates have moved up and down, there is higher turnover et cetera, et cetera. I think the relevance to NIM is more in our debt INL line because that looks and is more like the extension of credit and the margin you harvest on credit extension more broadly and because I think I responded earlier, our NIM has been very steady, literally marginal compression in the overall NIM in the book and I say that in the context of that book growing to an annualized basis of something on the order of $3.6 billion a year. Again, with all the attending vigilance to risk and the like. So, I think NIM is more relevant in the context of debt INL, less relevant in terms of observable metrics about the performance of our business most notably within the trading business itself. Marty Mosby : And could you give us some feel for what level of margin is in that business? Is it more relevant to that particular business? David Solomon : Well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to sort of give out the margins for each of the businesses. I would say that as you look across our businesses it wouldn't surprise you that on a segment basis investment banking and investing and lending carry with them very high margins, lower margins in the context of certain of the other businesses most notably in FICC and equities. So, I think that\u2019s probably a good survey if you will of sort of general direction of margin as and among the segments themselves. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather, otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and we look forward to speaking with you in January. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 15, 2020. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. Today, I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with brief highlights on our financial results, give an update on the broader operating environment, including developments related to 1MDB, and provide context for our upcoming Investor Day. Stephen will then discuss the recent enhancements we've made to our segment financial presentation, and cover fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in detail. They'll be happy to take your questions after that. I will now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I'm happy to be here with you. Let me begin on Page 1. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were $10 billion, up 23% versus a year-ago marking our highest fourth quarter since 2007. Net earnings were $1.9 billion resulting in earnings per share of $4.69 and an ROE of 8.7%. I would note that we took a $1.1 billion litigation charge during the quarter, which burdened EPS and ROE by $2.95 and 5.3% respectively. Overall, our business performed well and against an improved market environment relative to the challenging backdrop experienced a year-ago. For the 2019 full-year, we generated firmwide net revenues of $36.5 billion, nearly matching last year, which was our highest year in eight years. We reported a return on equity of 10% and a return on tangible equity of 10.6%. Litigation impact to ROE and ROTE was approximately 150 basis points for the year. We had a number of accomplishments in 2019. Our incumbent businesses across the firm performed well. And our new business initiatives progressed as planned, as we navigated a dynamic operating environment over the course of the year. On the revenue side, our Global Markets business produced stronger results in an environment that improved over the year, driven by strong leadership and a clear focus on client service. We generated solid growth in FICC driven by strength across our franchise, including rates, commodities, and mortgages. We grew firmwide assets under supervision to record levels. We also delivered strong equity investment performance, which is an important precursor to our alternative platform expansion plans. In Investment Banking, our performance was solid in the context of lower industry deal volumes. We held a commanding lead in our M&A business, and maintained our number one position in equity underwriting. While our operating expenses grew as a function of litigation and investments in our businesses, we actively controlled our costs across both compensation and non-compensation providing capacity to fund our growth. From this position of strength, we achieved important milestones in 2019 across our key growth opportunities. We continue to institutionalize our One Goldman Sachs operating philosophy, keeping clients at the center of everything we do. We launched the firm's first ever credit card platform in partnership with Apple, and generated over $850 million in net revenues across our broader consumer banking business. We completed the initial build of our digital transaction banking platform and processed over $2 trillion of payments on behalf of the firm. Our platform roll-out to third party clients remains planned for the first half of this year. We acquired United Capital bolstering our capabilities to provide a full spectrum of wealth management services to individuals. We realigned our investing businesses into a cohesive unit to support our alternative growth platform. We enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of the firm by integrating major portions of our operations and engineering teams into our businesses. And we strengthened our engineering capabilities with strategic hires of a new Chief Technology Officer and a Co-Chief Information Officer, and added talent across the firm. Importantly, we made significant investments to expand our client franchise, grow and diversify our revenues, and operate more efficiently. Including these investments, our overall performance was solid even though our investments reduced our returns in 2019. We are confident that they are improving the long-term profitability of Goldman Sachs. Turning to the operating environment on Page 2. In the fourth quarter we had solid engagement with our institutional clients and strong growth with our individual clients. Notwithstanding, corporate client sentiment remained more measured. During the quarter, we saw steadily rising asset prices, improvement in the secured funding market as the Federal Reserve took steps to bring stability throughout the quarter and particularly over year-end. We also saw progress towards Brexit resolution following the UK general election, and improvements in the U.S., China trade tensions, including the Phase 1 agreement. These conditions contributed to a supportive market making backdrop relative to a year-ago. Looking forward, our economists continue to expect global GDP growth in excess of 3% over the next two years. In the U.S., the fourth quarter provided a backdrop of solid growth, evidenced by a steepening yield curve and continued strong consumer sentiment. Conditions remain supported by the Federal Reserve's three mid-cycle rate cuts in 2019. Going forward, we expect U.S. growth to continue to run at about 2% given robust labor markets, low inflation, and strong wage growth. In Europe, growth continues to remain relatively low given manufacturing weakness. However in China trade headwinds appear to have moderated with both monetary and fiscal stimulus supporting growth estimates of nearly 6%. While we continue to monitor economic data, and emerging geopolitical risks, including escalating U.S. Iran tensions, based on what we see today, we remain optimistic that the current constructive environment for economic growth can continue. Next, I would like to take a moment to discuss the situation with 1MDB. As we mentioned last quarter, we are in ongoing discussions relating to a potential settlement of issues related to 1MDB with relevant authorities across multiple jurisdictions, including most notably the U.S. and Malaysia. Given the nature of these negotiations, we determine the need to take a litigation charge in the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier, our legal provision in the quarter was $1.1 billion with the preponderance related to 1MDB. While there can be no assurance of reaching a settlement, or the timing if we do, our conversations with authorities are progressing and remain active. We're working hard to bring closure to this matter as quickly as possible. As I\u2019ve said in the past, we do not believe this matter is representative of our longstanding values. Over the past several years, we've taken the time to be self-critical and reflective to ensure that our culture of integrity, collaboration, and escalation only improves from this experience. These efforts will continue. Lastly, before passing it over to Stephen, I would like to briefly address our upcoming Investor Day, which will be held on Wednesday, January 29. Through a series of presentations from John, Stephen, and me and our business and control side leadership, we hope to provide our stakeholders additional insight into the firm strategic direction. We\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our strategic priorities by business including new products and services that we have highlighted to you previously. We will also provide financial targets and goals by which our progress can be measured. We hope you will join us to the day either in person or via webcast. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David. Let's turn to Page 3. Before reviewing our financial results, I'd like to spend a moment discussing our new financial disclosure. On January 7, we announced a realignment of our segments, which form the basis of our earnings presentation today. We now report the following four businesses : Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management. We believe our revised financial reporting reflects our ongoing commitment to transparency. The segment is more closely aligned to how we now manage the firm with clear lines of management responsibility and leadership over each segment. The segments importantly also reflect how we serve our key clients, including corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals. And lastly, the segments provide for greater accountability in the execution of our forward strategy, as our initiatives are executed and reported. Importantly, I would note the key structural change to eliminate the investing and lending segment is consistent with our business strategy and will allow you to track our lending and financing activities alongside the relevant businesses as well as to allow our progress in a more transparent way. Also of note, and consistent with our broad commitment to transparency, we elected not to create a corporate segment. This is a different approach than many of our peers who retained costs or capital at the corporate level. We believe our process of allocating all firmwide costs and capital is a prudent management tool, and a more comprehensive way of evaluating the true performance of our businesses. Next, let me itemize several of the more significant elements of our segment changes which we listed in our recent 8-K filing. As I mentioned, the most significant change was the elimination of investing and lending. Now the results of our lending and financing activities are included within each of the four segments. For example, corporate lending activity is included in our Investment Banking segment. This encompasses relationship lending, transaction-related financing, and broader lending to our corporate clients. Secured or collateralized financing activity on behalf of institutional clients of our securities business is now reflected in FICC and equities financing within our Global Market segment. Lending related to our alternative investing businesses, including investments in debt securities and real estate credit is reflected in the Asset Management segment and lending to our individual clients across all wealth plans is in the Consumer & Wealth Management segment. Additionally, we now report the firm's on balance sheet equity, credit, and real estate investing activities in our Asset Management segment. This segment houses both GSEM and our merchant banking activities for Asset Management clients, supporting our third-party alternatives business expansion. Consolidating our on balance sheet and third party Asset Management investing activities is consistent with our forward-strategy. To that end, this segment includes management and incentive fees associated with Asset Management clients across the full spectrum of asset classes from cash to alternatives, and will also include the impact of quarterly valuation changes, the balance sheet positions held in public and private equity investments. Another significant change is additional disclosure in our new Consumer & Wealth Management segments, including wealth management fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending revenues, as well as consumer banking revenues. This segment houses our longstanding private wealth business, as well as our newer consumer offerings. Broadly speaking, and as I noted earlier, the new segments align with the client orientation of the firm Investment Banking, Global Markets and Asset Management encompass the firm's engagement with corporate, governments, and institutions, and Consumer &Wealth Management includes our engagement with individuals. With that as background, let me review the financial results of the firm on the basis of our new segments. Starting on Page 4, Investment Banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12% versus the third quarter, but down 6% versus a robust fourth quarter last year. For the full-year, Investment Banking net revenues were $7.6 billion, our second highest ever down 7% from a record 2018 reflecting lower industry deal volumes. Fourth quarter financial advisory revenues of $855 million were up 23% sequentially, but down 29% versus last year consistent with lower industry volumes. In 2019, we participated in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions and closed 375 deals for nearly $1.3 trillion of deal volume, contributing to our number one M&A league table rankings. Looking forward conditions for continued M&A activity remains solid. Client dialogues are healthy, financing markets are open, and we\u2019re seeing active interest across a variety of sectors. We also continue to see strength in our backlog coming into the New Year, notwithstanding solid revenue bookings from deal closings in the fourth quarter. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $378 million were up 3% versus the third quarter and up 23% versus last year. For the year, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by $68 billion of deal volumes across more than 375 transactions. During the quarter, where we saw particular strengths in our U.S. and European equity businesses, we participated in leadership roles on several of the largest public offerings. Turning to debt underwriting. Net revenues were $599 million, up 14% versus the third quarter and up 37% from a year-ago, reflecting higher asset-backed and leverage finance activity. Our franchise remains well-positioned, as evidenced by our number two high yield league table ranking. Revenues from corporate lending were $232 million. These revenues relate to a net $28 billion funded portfolio of corporate loans now held in investment banking, as well as our portfolio of corporate lending commitments. As background, there are three components to our corporate lending portfolio : relationship lending to our corporate clients, credit extensions for strategic activity including acquisition financing, and lending to our broadening footprint of corporate clients where we target attractive returns. Looking forward, given our active level of strategic dialogue, our expanding client footprint and strong corporate relationships, we remain optimistic about the continued level of commercial engagement by our corporate clients, aided by the current backdrop of well-functioning and constructive capital markets. Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, net revenues were $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter up 33% versus last year. Our growth was driven by a better market backdrop in FICC versus the end of last year, and strong performance in our equities businesses. For the full-year, Global Markets generated $14.8 billion of net revenues, up 2% versus 2018 driven by stronger FICC and higher equity financing performance. In the fourth quarter, FICC net revenues were $1.8 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 63% year-over-year. Our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues, where we saw better performance, as well as higher FICC financing revenues, notably in repo. Four out of five of our FICC market making businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior-year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model, and improved diversification of our business mix, our environment effectively. In commodities, our business performed well across the board, driven by significantly stronger performance in oil, natural gas and power, and investor products. In mortgages, net revenues rose aided by strong client activity and performance in agency securities. In currencies, net revenues improved versus last year amidst a better geopolitical backdrop despite lower volatility. We saw strong performance and activity around the general election in the UK, and saw a healthy corporate deal contingent hedging activity in the quarter. Lastly in credit, we saw better investment grade performance in the U.S. and EMEA offset by lower client activity. As we've discussed previously, we are working to further improve wallet share with each of our clients across both risk intermediation and financing, while investing to expand our capabilities to automate workflows, serve our clients electronically, and deliver structured solutions in efficient formats. Turning to equities on Page 6. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.7 billion down 8% versus the third quarter, but up 12% versus a year-ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $979 million rose 9% versus a year-ago on stronger cash revenues in the U.S. and Asia, and strong performance in low-touch and block trading, partially offset by lower derivatives activity. Equities financing revenues of $732 million were up 17% year-over-year, reflecting improved spreads and higher client balances. Financing activity remains a strategic priority for the business, given it has historically exhibited attractive returns and considerable adjacent benefits to our broader equities franchise, particularly for our growing systematic client base. Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. Collectively our Asset Management activities produced net revenues of $3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 52% versus last year, driven by stronger equity investment performance. For the full-year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $9 billion in line with a strong 2018 as growth in equity investment revenues offset lower incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees related to client assets under supervision totaled $666 million, up 6% versus a year-ago offset by lower incentive fees. Across the Asset Management segment, we managed AUS totaling $1.3 trillion at year-end, and we'll cover firmwide AUS trends in a few moments. Next our equity investments generated record quarterly net revenues in the fourth quarter of $1.9 billion, up significantly versus last year, driven by gains on our public and private investments. Approximately 90% of the gains were event driven, including sales or marks on public securities, as we took advantage of harvesting opportunities. The fourth quarter showed material improvement relative to the third quarter, where we experienced headwinds on certain large equity positions, including Avantor, Tradeweb, WeWork and Uber. During the fourth quarter, those positions taken together rebounded and for the full-year produced gains of approximately $400 million. In the quarter, we also exited our position in Uber and reduced our position in Tradeweb. Our public portfolio was $2.4 billion at year-end where appropriate we will continue to reduce the size of certain positions in the public portfolio. Net revenues from lending activities in Asset Management were $427 million and primarily relate to loans backed by commercial and residential real estate. Lending revenues include net interest income and mark-to-market gains on debt investments. On Page 8, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter, up 8% versus a year-ago. That's driven by our leading ultra-high net worth business, Ayco, and our newly acquired United Capital high net worth business, and our consumer banking businesses. For the full-year, Consumer & Wealth Management generated net revenues of $5.2 billion, essentially unchanged versus a year-ago, as strong consumer banking growth and higher management and other fees offset lower incentive fees. For the quarter, Wealth Management net revenues included record management and other fees of $967 million, up 17% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision rose to $561 billion at year-end. We also saw lower incentive fees, while private banking and lending revenues were relatively stable. Consumer banking revenues were $228 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 20% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and higher loan balances. Consumer deposits at year-end totaled $60 billion across the U.S. and UK, up nearly 70% versus last year. Funded consumer loan balances totaled approximately $7 billion, of which $5 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $2 billion from credit card lending. The slowing pace of growth in our Marcus unsecured loan business reflected the anticipated growth in our credit card lending from the launch of Apple Card. While still in early stages of growth, our consumer business generated a total of $864 million in revenues for the firm this year from a standing start just three-years ago. Now let's turn to Page 9 for our firmwide assets under supervision. Total client assets for which we earn a management fee including those in Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management, totaled a record $1.9 trillion in the fourth quarter, up $97 billion versus the third quarter and $317 billion versus a year-ago. Our 2019 growth was driven by $108 billion of long-term fee-based net inflows from fixed income and equity, including the acquisition of United Capital, $65 billion of liquidity net inflows, and $144 billion of market appreciation. Switching gears on Page 10, let's address net interest income in our lending portfolio. Total firmwide NII was $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, up 6% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, driven by loan growth. This NII measure is more comprehensive than the one we previously highlighted in debt I&L and most notably now includes all NII from Global Markets activities. For the full-year 2019, we reported NII of $4.4 billion, up 16% driven by deposit and loan growth in Consumer & Wealth Management, increased lending in Investment Banking, as well as more lending activity in Global Markets. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance. Our total loan portfolio was approximately $109 billion, up approximately $4 billion sequentially, and up $11 billion versus a year-ago, with the year-over-year increase encompassing corporate, commercial real estate, wealth management, and Apple Card loans. Our provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $336 million, up $45 million versus last quarter, driven primarily by idiosyncratic wholesale impairments and loan growth in our Apple Card portfolio. Provisions related to our Marcus portfolio were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter. Our firmwide net charge-off ratio increased by 20 basis points sequentially to approximately 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. Our losses remain in line with our expectations given the current point in the cycle. We continue to monitor the portfolio and broader risk factors and believe our credit exposure remains appropriately sized. We also take note that in 2020, we will experience a full-year of loan loss provisioning related to growth in the Apple Card portfolio. This growth in provisions will occur under the new CECL accounting standard, which requires reserves for the expected life of loan. Importantly, the reserve build for growing credit card portfolio does not reflect actual economic losses. Incremental reserve build will depend on loan growth but given our expectations for card growth, we expect our 2020 total firmwide loan loss provision to be higher than in 2019. With regard to CECL adoption, based on our loan portfolio as of year-end 2019, we expect to record a day one increase to our reserves of approximately $825 million in the first quarter, which will not impact our income statement or EPS. This will result in a one-time after-tax reduction to retained earnings of approximately $625 million which for regulatory capital purposes, will be phased in over the prescribed transition period. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 11. Our total operating expenses of $7.3 billion increased $2.1 billion versus the fourth quarter of last year, reflecting higher compensation and litigation expense in the quarter, as well as our continued investment for growth. On compensation, as we have said in the past, our philosophy remains to pay for performance. And we\u2019re committed to compensating top talent. Our full-year compensation ratio of 33.8% is roughly flat versus 2018 and our compensation expenses were flat year-over-year. Over the course of 2019, we reduced compensation expenses across many of our businesses to improve operating efficiency and to support incremental compensation expenses related to our growth initiatives where revenue production is beginning to materialize. As we have said in the past, longer term, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses. On non-compensation expense, our cost for the full-year 2019 rose 13% versus last year with litigation expenses and investment spend contributing to that growth. Specifically, litigation expenses accounted for 300 basis points of the percentage increase. While investments in technology and new businesses, including specifically Marcus, Apple Card, Transaction Banking, and United Capital, added another 300 basis points. We also incurred additional expenses from our consolidated investments. For the full-year, the total pretax impact of our organic business projects, including Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking is approximately $700 million resulting in a drag of roughly 70 basis points on our ROE. At Investor Day, we will talk more about our plans for these businesses to scale over the coming years, and how we expect them to be accretive to our returns. For the full-year, our efficiency ratio was 68% which includes a 340 basis point impact from litigation expense. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 17% for the fourth quarter and 20% for the year. Our tax rate this quarter reflected the impact of updated guidance from U.S. Treasury regarding the BEAT tax and incorporates an adjustment to prior quarterly accruals relating to this guidance. Given this updated guidance, we expect our tax rates over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to select balance sheet data on Slide 12, let's begin with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.3% using the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially driven by lower shareholders equity. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased by 30 basis points to 13.7% due to enhancements in loss given default severity modeling that were favorable to the ratio. Our SLR of 6.2% was flat sequentially. During the full-year 2019, we returned a total of $6.9 billion of capital to common shareholders through both share repurchases and common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 362 million shares down over 30% from our peak in 2010. Our book value per share was $219, up 5% versus a year-ago. As you will recall, our share repurchase authorization for the 2020 CCAR cycle, beginning in the third quarter of 2019 was $7 billion or $1.75 billion a quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased only $673 million carrying forward the unused authorization. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.2 billion utilizing approximately $400 million of the prior quarter\u2019s unutilized capacity. Going forward, we carry a repurchase authorization of approximately $4.2 billion over the next six months. As we make capital return decisions, we will continue to balance our priorities of prudent capital management, and the return of capital in excess of what is needed for investment that is shareholder accretive. As such, the magnitude of our forward repurchases will as always depend on our earnings, capital levels, and competing investment opportunities. Now, turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the year at $993 billion, essentially unchanged versus the third-quarter and up 7% versus last year, driven by higher plan activity and areas of growth across the firm. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $190 billion, up $32 billion versus last year, while our total unsecured long-term borrowings were $207 billion down $17 billion over the same period. Over the full-year, we refinanced approximately $20 billion of parent vanilla debt maturities with approximately $5 billion of issuance, relying more significantly on our growth in retail, and other deposits, as we continue to diversify our funding sources. This trend toward deposit growth and reduction in unsecured long-term borrowings should continue. Before taking questions, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the $5 billion organic growth initiative announced in 2017. That initiative comprised a number of important efforts on which we continue to execute, including client expansion in investment banking, wallet share growth in global markets, consumer loan and deposit growth, lending and financing deployment and asset management growth. As we go forward, we will continue to execute on these initiatives but our focus and communication will instead reflect more ambitious firmwide performance targets to be introduced on Investor Day. We will not be focused on revenue targets but rather on returns and efficiency, consistent with our broader long-term strategic plans to drive shareholder value. These targets will also reflect growth opportunities that were not included in the original $5 billion, such as transaction banking and credit cards. We look forward to discussing our new targets in detail at the end of the month. In conclusion, our fourth quarter was strong, leading to full-year performance that was in line with the evolving macro environment and reflective of our continued investment in new businesses. We aim to operate more efficiently and drive higher returns in the future and look forward to sharing our medium and long-term objectives at Investor Day in approximately two weeks\u2019 time. With that, thanks again for dialing in, and we will now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I don't know what to expect on this one. So doing more lending across the franchise and it clearly is working. And you now break out for us intermediation versus financing in trading or in markets and I think there's opportunity to do more there. Some of your peers do a lot more on the financing side. So the small question is, are we going to see more at Investor Day in terms of metrics that we can help model and build and evaluate performance on and that's question one on that. And question two on that is how quickly can you expect those to a) grow and b) enhanced returns over the next year or two? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks, Glenn. It's Stephen; I'll take your question. I guess on this small question you asked, which is should you expect more disclosure and the frequency of it, I think the answer is ultimately, yes. As it relates to lending broadly around the firm, there are a number of categories of lending that will over time become more material and as they become more material, we will both by obligation but equally by interest look to provide incremental, more information on that lending. I would say consumer is a good example of that as between unsecured consumer lending, and equally what we're doing on the credit card side. I think broadly speaking in lending, I would say mindful of the cycle; our clear plan is to grow financing revenues in both FICC and equities to answer your direct question. And I would say, the type of lending that's going on there is largely in the repo business and FICC is in prime and equities. I think from a credit risk point of view, we like and can digest and evaluate that risk, notwithstanding where we sit in the cycle more broadly, and I think metrics in Global Markets around that lending again will continue to grow out. Last thing I'll say as it relates to Investor Day, look we're going to lay out certain targets at the enterprise level, we will be more disclosive about individual businesses. But I think equally important Investor Day will be the beginning and not the end of a dialogue around this so that the numbers just don't stand alone and we give you context for rate of growth and how we're managing it. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate anything there. And then on the expanding the corporate client base, the specific question I have is, are you fully cut over on processing Goldman's cash management payments? And where are we in terms of dialogue with signing on any clients? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So in transaction banking, as we have said from its inception, we would be the first customer and then we would look to bring on clients of the firm. We are the first customer. And I think, as was mentioned during the script, we've been processing payments on behalf of the firm across five currencies and totaling about $2 trillion in terms of what's getting processed. And so, that's going well, and the firm is obviously benefiting from that as deep as a customer, lower operational deposits on deposit with commercial banks in that regard. We have all along been in dialogue with clients of the firm first in the context of getting their sense and input as to what this platform ought to look like. How would we design it so as to meet pain points that they are experiencing. That collaborative engagement has been going on and we are now engaging these clients as future customers of the firm in the context of transaction banking with certain of them already putting operational deposits on deposit with the bank. And I think as we've said in 2020, you'll see that client roster and that participation in the business grow. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. Firstly, thank you for the new disclosure. It's very helpful. My first question is on credit provisions. It looks like about a third of the credit provisions are and the vast majority of sequential quarter increase in provisions came from the Asset Management division. But when I look at sort of the NII disclosure on Page 10, it looks like only 15% of NII comes from Asset Management. So I'm not sure what the mismatch is there. But just to step back here a little bit, help us understand what exact kind of lending goes on in the Asset Management division. Maybe a bit more color on the credit quality there and the overall return profile of that portfolio. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks, Christian for the question. So let me start with kind of the geography and the segment. So in our Asset Management business sits alternative lending. So think about that as a portion of the old debt I&L, so this is mezz and lending, that's made on a principal basis. So what you see reflected in that line is both net interest income that's derived from those assets, and equally volatility in the valuation of those debt assets themselves. So that describes the geography of it. In terms of what played out over the course of the year in provisioning. So the delta in provisioning for the full-year was $390 million. About $100 million of that was found in the Consumer &Wealth management business and the vast majority of that was related to provisioning to the growth in Apple Card. I should point out it was not related to any either impairments or off-model if you will; provisioning related to the balance of the consumer business, it was related to the growth in Apple Card. The balance of the $390 million call it $300 million or so related to impairments on loans across a variety of different segments, Asset Management being one, Investment Banking being the other, and that was around corporate wholesale credit, it involved impairments across a range of different industries, most notably in energy, some in manufacturing, none of which were material in the context of the firm. And so that's the way the provisioning divided up as between impairments and loan loss provisioning for the growth largely in the Apple Card portfolio. Christian Bolu : That\u2019s okay, thank you, helpful. Maybe just stepping back on the balance sheet as a whole, you\u2019re kind of sitting close to a $1 trillion, which is more or less kind of the highest levels of financial crisis in a way. So just help us understand just broadly speaking, what's driving growth and sort of the returns you're getting for deploying incremental balance sheets and then just longer-term, how critical is balance sheet growth to driving revenue growth and how does that sort of factor your longer term thinking around capital return? Stephen Scherr : Yes, so I would say a couple of things. First, as a general matter, our balance sheet growth is itself purely a function of being in the service of client demand. So we're guided entirely by where demand lies for client petitioning of the firm in the context of the flow of our business. So over the course of 2019, we've deployed balance sheet by example against repo where there was demand for liquidity, particularly in the context of the various uncertainty that existed in the repo market, we grew balance sheet. So as to stand there is an intermediary of liquidity for our clients. So it grows as a function of client demand. I think as we think about areas of balance sheet growth, we think about it purely in the context of accretive returns for the firm. It's not a revenue driven proposition, it's really about can we deploy balance sheet on behalf of clients so as to generate accretive returns to the firm. And that's kind of the true north, if you will, that's where the compass points in terms of how our balance sheet ultimately -- ultimately fluctuates. And candidly as the CFO, I look at balance sheet much as I do liquidity or any other resource around the firm as allocating in the pursuit of accretive growth oriented opportunities and shareholder return for our stakeholders. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe first this revenue trends are strong in the quarter. I think you mentioned corporate sentiment is still a bit muted, which I think can take more time. I'm just curious if you're seeing any improvement on the corporate front. And then on the institutional side, were there any asset purchases during the quarter that had much impact on global markets? David Solomon : Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. There's no question I think that the environment during the course of the year improved as the year went on. And while I say corporate sentiment has still lagged a little particularly given some of the macro overlays like U.S., China, trade et cetera. There's no question in the fourth quarter the environment improved. Based on the data or information we can see across activity and dialogue with clients, I would say that it's improved in the fourth quarter and the trends that we're seeing early into 2020 are a little bit more positive. And so those would be the usual things that we could look at across activity set. With respect to your second question, there were no material asset purchases that impacted global markets. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just quick follow-up on the efficiency ratio, I'm sure you guys will get into that in two weeks. And there was a lot of noise this quarter, but I think in the past, you mentioned, I think 2019 kind of being the height of investments. I just want to get an update on does that still pertain and we should start to see some improvement on the efficiency ratio as the revenues in some of the newer areas start to gain traction? Stephen Scherr : Sure, thanks Michael. So on the efficiency ratio, at Investor Day in my presentation, I will go through kind of that migration and give you the elements of it. Obviously, it feeds both in the context of revenue and expense. And so we'll go through that. In terms of your question on the height of investment, I have said and would reiterate here that 2019 is the depth of investment, when you look at investment across three of our discrete products, namely Marcus, Apple Card, and Transaction Banking, and equally I've made that reference and again, reiterate here excluding the reserve calculation which I obviously spoke of in the context of the prepared remarks. So when you look at the investment ex-reserve 2019 for those three initiatives is the lower point and I think we'll start to see reduced expenditures relating to that. I would say that overall, and then again, this relates back a bit to your efficiency question, my expectation around non-complex -- non-compensation expense ex-litigation is that it would run roughly flat in 2020 relative to where we are. The whole ambition of what we're doing around expenses is trying to create operating leverage and efficiency so as to continue to fund investment around the firm. And that's not investment limited to the three products that I spoke about, but equally across technology investments around the infrastructure of the firm and the like. And so we'll start to see that play out. Obviously, in the context of flat expenses year-over-year, our hope and expectation is that we'll start to see higher revenue generation from some of these investments, which will play out positively in the context of the efficiency ratio itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start-off just taking into some of the new segment disclosures, particularly the consumer and wealth side of the business. And clearly what stood out most to us and you alluded to this earlier in the call was the pretax margin coming -- running much lower somewhere close to 10% on clearly the new business initiatives, the significant drag that that's had on the margin is quite evident. I was hoping you could speak to what inning you\u2019re in currently, just in terms of the platform build out and new investment for that strategy specifically and just through the cycle, how we could think about long-term pretax margin potential for that segment, as you continue to scale and maybe begin to run a bit closer to some of the peer comps? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So let me answer the question generally. We have disclosed, obviously, information around expenses and pretax. Our intention at Investor Day is to go to pretax margin and returns across the whole of the business. And then in the context of that will provide you in Investor Day, our intent is to continue to do that on quarterly earnings calls like this. So you should have an expectation that we will continue along that path. I'd also say and I'll reflect on this here generally but more specifically in our Investor Day, our intent is not to leave you in the dark as to the Consumer & Wealth management segment in terms of overall margins, meaning, we want to give you a sense of where the wealth business sits that is the PWM business, which obviously demonstrates a much higher margin than what the segment reveals with the segment being in effect burdened by the continued growth in investment spend in the consumer space. So, we will separate that out. My guidance to you in terms of expectation is that the wealth management segment or sub segment within that performs at a much more market level margin than the way in which the segment otherwise illustrates but again we will decompose that for you with context as we move forward. Steven Chubak : That's great to hear, Stephen, and just one follow-up for me as it relates to the provision. I appreciate the detail you provided in earlier question. The guidance calling for higher provision in 2020, I don't think that comes as a big surprise to anyone. But just given expectations for a healthy step-up in provision, simply due to CECL implementation and some loan -- consumer loan seasoning, I was hoping you could maybe just help us frame a bit better, what's a reasonable provision level or run rate expectation if there's no change in the macro, but we simply have to reflect the impact of CECL with an assumption that you'll see relatively steady growth in consumer loans? Stephen Scherr : Yes. Look I think generally speaking, our own budget is in the realm of call it $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in terms of a broader budget. I would say a lot of that reflects continued growth in the Apple Card portfolio as well as lending more generally but again as you grow from a negligible level at the inception through to what we hold both in terms of roughly $1.9 billion of where we are and what that growth will be in the ensuing year. Obviously, that provision through 2020 will be exaggerated; you'll see it that way. But that's just part of the overall growth. As an aside, the provisioning growth related to Apple Card again, more from a standing start is itself burdened by CECL relative to where provisioning would have been. So it's marginally more exaggerated in the context of the life of loan component to CECL and the like. Now what I offer you by way of budget is just that. It obviously will depend on the pace of loan growth broadly, the pace of loan growth in Apple Card, which we are going to calibrate that based purely on risk parameters and our own judgment about the tone and nature of the market in which we're operating. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, it's a little bit of a philosophical question around lending and how you're thinking about your various loan books. And the question is kind of coming from the perspective that I'm thinking you're -- you've been working with a balance sheet that\u2019s a high velocity balance sheet. And I'm wondering if you perceive your various loan books as moving more from a velocity balance sheet towards a storage balance sheet? Is there anything in there? I'm thinking about, do you hedge some of your loan books now? Are there some that you're going to continue to hedge, some that you would not consider hedging? Does it impact how we think about the capital and the capital allocation to loans? I'm wondering if that resonates at all with how you're thinking about the loan books in the various segments. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Yes, no, no, no, it's a very good question. I\u2019d say the following. First, there's nothing about what we're doing in growing our loan book particularly around consumer for example that is in effect substitution for business that we\u2019ll continue to do of a capital markets orientation around lending. So for example, and we look at the two, consistent with trends that each market shows and kind of risk parameters and levers that we hold to manage risk. I'll give you an example. If you think about corporate lending, so for example, lending we make by way of acquisition financing that we provide to our clients. When I look at in the context of our deal book has a lot to do with size, but equally with velocity turn. So right now, our deal book turns that inside of three months, that's an important metric to think about; as we manage corporate lending and capital markets related lending that's going on. That's less of a relevant consideration, if you will, in the context of growth in our consumer loan book, or what we do around Apple Card as a component of that. There we\u2019re quite careful to consider what we do about provisioning, how we think about the qualitative overlay to the size of our provisioning as we look at a maturation of that portfolio, start to look at more on-premise data as it relates to our consumer portfolio, as opposed to third-party metrics. And so we think about these two things, in some sense differently in terms of what you apply by way of the rigor and metric and overlay in managing that risk. But equally we obviously look at the totality of lending that's going on and the rate of growth as it relates to the overall balance sheet and the firm itself. So I hope that's helpful in sort of our broad philosophical approach to lending. Betsy Graseck : And does it then come back towards capital and what kind of capital ratios you need. What I'm hearing is on the consumer side maybe more capital consumptive, but obviously there's an ROA associated with that that should pay for it. Whereas on the banking side that velocity suggests that it might not be as capital consumptive as commercial whole loan in a different organization? Stephen Scherr : Yes, we know we had answered that question, again to sort of stick to sort of a broad view of it all from the firm. We are driving and growing new businesses at the firm that inevitably will carry with them more durable and recurring fee revenue. They will therefore will by definition carry with it less stress loss in the context of it. They will in some sense be less capital dense than where they\u2019ve been. And so we're going to evaluate risk return against the capital that's required against each individual business and render judgments there as to what those returns look like on a capital adjusted basis, where we want to deploy capital, where we don't. I guess what I'm suggesting to you it's a much more dynamic process than not. And but overall, it fits within the component of growing and building businesses that have less stress draw, and therefore the potential for lower density from a capital perspective. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Stephen I think you said non-comp should be flat in 2020. But in 2019, almost every non-comp category went higher. So is that simply because of jus why you said is the question? What\u2019s changing? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So Mike, maybe the best way to answer that is let me decompose a little bit of the growth year-over-year in non-comp expense. So as you know, we reported a 13% increase in non-comp expense, about 3% was related to litigation. I'm not going to -- I'm not going to sort of foreshadow where that will be. But just to understand in the component of growth, 3% of the 13% was just that. About another 3% -- 3% to 4% was related to broader investment around the firm, whether that's tech investment, consumer, transaction banking and United Capital. Now, that's going to grow but that segment of non-comp expense is going to start to sort of graduate off as those businesses start to hit a certain level of maturity. And as I said, we\u2019re looking to prune expenses all around the firm, so as to create operating leverage and fund the continued investment expense that's there. And then, finally, I would say, there is -- there are certain elements of investment entities and other components of expense growth in non-comp that equally will come off over time. So I just draw that out. What I do want to tell you is that as we get to Investor Day, we're going to give you a certain expense target that we're going to look to harvest out of the firm in very concrete terms that will help feed what I've been describing, which is an objective of creating capacity for reinvestment in the firm over time. And so that's why when I guide you that direction as being flat, it is consistent with creating that capacity. There will be growth, some of the growth will come off, others will be funded by capacity, we create in and around the firm. Mike Mayo : That's helpful. And then just one big picture question both David and you Stephen mentioned what functioning and constructive capital markets. You said the trends early 2020 are more positive. Why do you think that's the case? And do you think this time is different versus the past decade? Do you think these improvements are sustainable or not? What's your level of conviction? In other words, we haven't heard you on the earnings call Dave or Stephen for a long period of time, so we can't tell your relative constructiveness on the market? So I guess little more color on that. David Solomon : All right, well I appreciate the question, Mike. And I don't know that I can help you with my relative. I'll try to reiterate some of the things that I said. And hopefully, it'll be helpful context. So, I do think the economic environment at the moment is constructive. What I said on the call about the U.S. economy and our expectation of growth of about 2% in 2020, we have relatively high conviction on. I can give you a set of things from a macro geopolitical perspective that could change which would significantly shock confidence and therefore change that picture. But I think the chance of that happening in 2020 at this point seems low. It's not zero, but it doesn't seem likely. I think that there's been a slight improvement and that's what I said when I was asked earlier, we were talking about corporate sentiment, a slight improvement in corporate sentiment as we came to the end of the year and there was some progress in the year on some of the macro overhang that would have a tendency to affect corporate sentiment. And so I think you have a slightly more positive corporate sentiment heading into 2020. And I do see some indications around deal activities that looked a little stronger in the fourth quarter and as we stepped into the first quarter of this year. So I do think it's constructive. I make comments with respect to sluggishness in Europe, but a little bit more constructive on China. Again with a little bit of a clearing of the U.S., China as a step forward, that might remove some slight headwinds. But I don't know how to give you a relative. I think our general point of view is in the distribution of outcomes. The highly most likely outcome is we have a relatively benign economic environment in 2020. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up on the target around the non-comp and your expectations. I think Stephen, you had said that you expect to it to be flat from here. Just to clarify, is that from here non-comp for the full-year of 2019 ex-litigation, or is that the 4Q run rate ex-litigation? Stephen Scherr : No, I would say it's in the 2019 ex-litigation kind of where we stand on the full-year. Brennan Hawken : Perfect, thank you very much. And then another one on expenses. There was curious about comp, and whether or not there might have been some noise in the comp ratio this year, there was an elevated level of partners retiring. Did that have any impact on that metric here this year or less so? David Solomon : Thanks for the question, Brennan. No with respect to the comp ratio, partner retirements and the movement of partners in and out of the firm had no impact on the comp ratio. I would just comment because I've seen some commentary on this. When we look at the movement of partners through the cycle, the two-year cycle of partners and we have an election coming up this fall, there's nothing about the movement in 2019 that looks different to us than the movement we've seen over the first year of the last number of cycles. So we have movement on our partnership, it\u2019s part of the culture of the partnership that younger partners have brought up. And despite some of the dialog around it, we don't see anything significant about the movement of partners at this point in the cycle. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Maybe we can talk a little bit about your expansion of the alternatives business and just maybe talk a little bit about the efforts to accelerate that growth and if there will be any kind of balance sheet usage associated with that, or is it really going to be just sort of AUM growth? David Solomon : So what we've tried to do and at the Investor Day, we will give you more color on this and kind of walk you through a plan around it. So we went to an alternative business that has been some client capital and balance sheet capital. And in the context of that client capital and balance sheet capital, the business has been housed in multiple different businesses spread across the firm. We've now brought all those businesses together in one business. And we are -- we have put together and are moving forward with a plan to significantly increase the institutional client money that we manage with that infrastructure around the globe. Historically, we have managed some institutional money, but we've managed very significant private wealth money in addition to using our balance sheet. On a go-forward basis, we don't plan to grow the balance sheet, but we will continue to use balance sheet. But we will remix that balance sheet. So that the RWA density is different and it's less capital intensive. But the primary growth plan for the business is to over time raise a significantly increased amount of institutional capital that appreciates the fact that our consolidated alternative platform is broad, global, and deep. And that we operate in all the different categories, private equity, growth equity, credit, infrastructure, real estate, and we also do it all over the world and have resources all over the world to execute on that. And that is very attractive to the long -- the large institutional capital raisers and we have not traditionally attacked or partnered with him across this broad platform. And so at Investor Day, we will give you more color on how we plan to do that and what you could expect from that over the coming five years. Jim Mitchell : That's really helpful. Is there any challenge or do you find in competing with your more pure play competitors that are publicly traded. Do you think there's some sort of disadvantage in raising institutional money having your hands in other businesses? Or do you don't think that's an issue? David Solomon : Well, we've been in these businesses for 30 years, and we've executed well in these businesses for 30 years, we've also been a leader in providing services to those businesses that you refer to. We have an active dialogue with those companies about our activities and what we plan to do. And John, Stephen and I are extremely focused on the client orientation and the client nature in the context of the way we run the firm. The other firms that are out there has very, very ambitious institutional capital raising plans from institutions, but there's a lot of capital to allocate, and we're very comfortable that they can raise a lot of capital, we can raise a lot of capital. What's interesting about this business is this is a business that actually is growing secularly. And so we think we're very well-positioned given where we are both to participate, but also to continue to service those clients in a differentiated and value-added way. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes, actually my question is related to that last one, which is looking at the Asset Management segment and the $22 billion of mainly private equity investments. I guess the question is I mean, if you put it in the context of the publicly traded alternatives, Blackstone has a pretty big business and their GP investments is about $1.08 billion by comparison, and so what is the strategic need for and rationale for keeping that large of a balance sheet commitment? David Solomon : So we have a differentiated model, and there's no question that Blackstone operate the business with very low -- with no capital. If maybe we were starting today from scratch with a white sheet of paper, you might develop the business differently. But what's happened because of the way we run our business is we built out a very, very broad deep global network of investors all over the world. And we think that's a real asset to capital allocators. We've done that because we've built up strength, investing off our balance sheet. And historically, candidly, one of the things investors have liked is they like the fact that we partner with them, and we have skin in the game. And we're committed to investments with them. That alignment, I think is a very, very good thing. And I think that'll be a differentiated component of our strategy here. And so strategically, that's something I think that differentiates us in the context of this strategy. Also, as we grow new products and services in the space around the world and add to what we're doing, it is easier to fund the acceleration of that if you do have the capacity to use balance sheet to jumpstart some of those businesses. So again going back to what I said before, we would not expect the balance sheet to grow; we would expect to change the RWA density by shifting some out of equity into more credit or infrastructure type assets. But we think we have a competitive advantage or a different strategy that's a good advantage to partner with our clients and we plan to continue it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Hey I guess first question here. So, I saw the Marcus App was rolled out last week. And I'm just curious what took so long, I guess to get that out. And how are you thinking about integrating that with some of the other products in consumer and really integrating it with Clarity Money in that app as well? And really, the question is, I'm just trying to understand some of the branding and consumer and what you're going to be using called as digital storefront? Stephen Scherr : So on the Marcus App, when we first began Marcus three years ago, you recall that, our two products were deposits and unsecured loans. So the utility of the app early on was not quite high, meaning people who carry loan are not looking to check on it with the frequency of those that use apps for their day-to-day exchange. And so we sort of set a set of priorities for ourselves in terms of the direction we were going to build. And we would ultimately come upon the app. I would say at -- from the moment we began to think about the design of the app and in fact, bringing Clarity Money into the house, the idea was to take the best of the technology, that is what Clarity Money had developed, which was super interesting in terms of prompts and the use of intelligence to do that and kind of a two-way engagement with the user consumer app, we wanted to embed that in a broader app that we would roll out. So you're seeing the first phase of that now particularly as people will start to engage more and more with us again with greater frequency than they did at the start, and we're embedding the best of what is Clarity Money in the context of the creation of that app overall. And so it was really a question of anticipated use, slower at the start, faster now, a question of priorities and now bringing it together. On your question about branding, I think I'll defer you to Investor Day when we'll talk a lot more with much greater context than I could answer in a single question on the branding strategy around consumer and around Wealth Management more broadly. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. Looking forward to that. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Devin Ryan : And then just a follow-up here modeling in the comp ratio and cadence moving forward. So the fourth quarter comp ratio was about 600 basis points below the first quarter level, I know that's much tighter than historical relationship and I also know consistent with how you're now looking to accrue on more of a real time basis? You also had a very strong fourth quarter for equity investment performance, which I would think I have a lower comp ratio to it. So I'm just trying to get some flavor for whether the 2019 relationship is a decent proxy on a quarterly basis or it is a stronger fourth quarter in the equity performance and maybe skew that a bit lower? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So let me start from the top. As you know our comp and benefits line was flat year-over-year, and our comp to net revenue number was roughly in line slightly higher than where it was last year. So that's to look at the full-year. Embedded in your question was in fact, the right reference, which is, as I've said several times, we are accruing for compensation each quarter as the accounting standards require, which is our best estimate of the compensation we would need. And so we've done that much more on a straight line without relying or waiting on the fourth quarter so as to be a bigger adjustment. And so you're seeing more straight line because of that, you're seeing this fourth quarter variability relative to where we were in the past. That's just a function of the way in which we are now accounting, again more of a straight line than not. I would say just to step back from the particulars. You know, I think that from a compensation point of view, we had taken payroll and compensation expense down in a number of different businesses over the year in order to redeploy compensation to populations of people that are working on some of the growth businesses that we have. By definition, that compensation dollar is not producing an equal amount of revenue as it would in other areas, it will as those businesses grow and mature. And so part of this is a reallocation of compensation in that direction, while maintaining comp and benefits at a constant or flat year-over-year and reflecting in on the comp to net revenue number being roughly flat as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : I was wondering -- and you may not be able to answer this question today, which is fine. And if you can\u2019t possibly you may want to give us this detail at Investor Day. In the regulatory filings for all the banks, there's a category of loans called loans to non-depository financial institutions. And when we look at that for the top banks like your own, the growth has been pretty impressive since 2013. And when we look at it for your organization back then it was about $6.7 billion. And today, it's approximately $43 billion. So the question is what's in that portfolio? And again, if you don't have the details, I understand but maybe you could share with us on Investor Day some good details of what's in that portfolio? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So I think I don\u2019t -- I want to give you an answer with some specificity. So let me suggest that Heather Miner and her team get back in touch with you and we can itemize as is publicly disclosed, what exactly sits in that category and we can give you some progression of how that's migrated. I just don't have the particulars around that to hand. Gerard Cassidy : That's okay. And that's not unusual by the way. When we asked this question to other banks, most people don't really give us the details. But that's fine. Then a second question. Can you give us some color; obviously, the Apple Card has received a wonderful amount of publicity. And Apple is branded it of course, is a card created by them and not a bank type of logo. The question I have is Apple is obviously very respectful of their brand and their customers. And in a recession, we all know unemployment goes up, and we also know that credit card delinquencies are linked to unemployment. Had you guys -- is there anything that concerns you that as we go into a recession say unemployment goes to 6%, delinquencies for all the credit cards more than double from where we are today? Are you going to be hamstrung trying to collect those delinquencies because of the way it's been branded as an Apple Card and it's not a bank. Stephen Scherr : Yes. So thanks for the question. I want to be really clear on this, notwithstanding whoever lays claim to the creation of the card. There's only one institution that's making underwriting decisions, and that's Goldman Sachs. So Goldman Sachs is making all of the underwriting decisions as it relates to it. We have set targets and goals and objectives along with Apple as a good partner would and Apple is completely in the know as to sort of how we are going about these underwriting decisions. But the ultimate decision sits with us and so we calibrate, manage our risk and collections in the context of that. And so I think I just want to be really clear about that, it is the bank that renders underwriting decisions in that regard. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. I'll be quick here. Looks like on the consumer side, you saw deposits go up about $5 billion this quarter. So you seem to have better growth from your entry to new markets. Is there any type of geographic expansion that you're planning within the markets does anything kind of accelerate growth on deposits there? Stephen Scherr : Yes, sure, thank you. The question has come up frequently. Obviously the primary growth is in the U.S., in the UK, we have seen considerable growth in deposits, which has really pleased us even relative to the early expectations. We have looked at a variety of other jurisdictions in terms of where we could raise deposits. Germany is a name has come up several times. It's natural that it would in the context of Brexit and planning and doing more asset generation in through our European business. I think we'll wait and see how things progress around Brexit, the size, magnitude and pace of asset growth there, before we make a decision about where we next plant the flag from a deposit perspective. And so there are no immediate plans in terms of a next in terms of next jurisdiction, but we continue to evaluate it. And we have built the platform particularly in UK with embedding greater flexibility for us to open it or open a new jurisdiction without building from ground zero. And so it was planned with that in mind. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : So since there are no more questions, I would like to just take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we hope to see many of you later this month. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise enjoy the rest of your day, and we look forward to speaking with you at Investor Day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 15, 2020. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with the firm\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including our organizational resilience and business continuity and our efforts to support our communities around the world. Then he will speak to our results in the context of the recent market volatility and the broader operating environment. Stephen will then discuss our first quarter results in detail, including the firm\u2019s strong financial position and our execution priorities in the current environment. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I will now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather and thank you everyone for joining this morning. First and foremost, all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are grappling with an unprecedented global crisis that is putting extraordinary pressure on all society, on families, on small business owners, on large companies, on non-profit organizations, on governments and economies around the world, and of course on the healthcare system. There is no doubt some segments of society, particular our most vulnerable communities and small businesses are suffering more than others. Thankfully there are areas of inspiration. To all of the frontline workers, including doctors, the nurses, the individuals showing up to work everyday to keep our supermarkets, our pharmacies, and our public transportation operating through this crisis, we are extremely grateful to you and we are in awe of your courage and dedication. From where we sit today, it is too early to know the full impact or to predict the specific path to recovery. But I am confident, particularly in light of the decisive and thoughtful actions being taken around the world by the public and private sector that together we will overcome this adversity. Our people have demonstrated time and time again extraordinary resilience and the ability to grow and adapt to change. I am enormously proud of how our colleagues have risen to the occasion in recent weeks. They have been working tirelessly to help our clients navigate the challenging and volatile markets brought about by this pandemic. And as a leadership team, our first priority remains the safety and well-being of all of our Goldman Sachs teammates. To do this, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan. This has been an extraordinary effort with exemplary performance from all involved, especially our engineering and operation teams admits the significant increase in market volatility. Over the past months now, we have been operating with approximately 98% of our global employees working remotely, while handling 2x to 3x the normal trading volumes and maintaining very high levels of engagement across all our stakeholders from corporations and institutions to individuals. Across the globe, including our teams in Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City, we successfully outfitted employees with the necessary technology to work, communicate and engage without interruption. Our smooth transition is a testament to our forward planning, technology capabilities and business resiliency. At a time of reduced market liquidity, our people are working relentlessly to support our clients. This effort includes intensive engagement by our operations team who worked alongside their industry counterparts to clear the extraordinary volumes of trades, sales and margin activity. Throughout these events, the level of cooperation among financial institutions and the dedication and resiliency of our people is inspiring. We are also staying very close to our corporate clients. Over the past few weeks, I have personally spoken to almost 100 CEOs to share best practices, offer advice and often to take advice from them. They face a variety of challenges, including distribution and supply chain disruptions and cash flow uncertainty. Many are working to keep their employees on the payroll despite a significant revenue headwind. I am broadly impressed by the private sector efforts to work together to help our communities navigate this crisis. For our part to help support corporate financing needs, we are proud that in recent weeks we have reopened markets and underwritten a record amount of U.S. dollar investment grade debt for clients. In addition, we have been an active participant in programs announced by the Federal Reserve to support the economy. We are also supporting the flow of capital in international markets. This year, we have led over $15 billion of Fight COVID-19 bonds, including issuances for the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, Austria, France and Indonesia, where proceeds will be used to alleviate the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. During this period, we have also been actively engaged with our individual customers across the wealth spectrum. This is included providing advice, financing, execution and investing opportunities for our PWM and high net worth clients. In consumer banking, it has been providing uninterrupted access to our digital deposits, lending and payments products and continuous service through our call centers, which are now operating virtually. We have also taken important steps to support our consumer banking clients through this challenging time. We were early to announce the COVID-19 customer assistance program in March and we have now extended it to April giving our customers the flexibility to skip a monthly payment without penalty or interest. More broadly over the past 6 weeks, John, Stephen and I have remained in active dialog with central banks, governments and regulators. We commend the rapid, forceful and unprecedented fiscal and regulatory responses designed to ensure liquid and well-functioning capital markets and to provide emerging fee financing to small businesses and individuals that need it most. These actions will undoubtedly help mitigate the demand shocks caused by the virus and speed the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. government along with the ECB, Bank of England and other global central banks have sent a clear message that they will decisively support the broader economy with the global banking system as an active partner. Goldman Sachs, alongside many other financial institutions, is prepared to play our part to help communities and businesses, both small and large, suffering from the economic impact of this devastating health crisis. We are harnessing our resources, experience and network to help where we can. We are working with public and private sector clients to partner on new initiatives with a focus on community assistance and economic support for businesses and serving our clients and customers. For our part, we have taken a number of important steps, including making a $550 million commitment to COVID-19 relief efforts. We will help small business owners weather this challenging time to $500 million for small business loans and $25 million in grants to community development financial institutions who have a long track record of reaching underserved communities and businesses. We have worked with many of these mission-driven lenders for years through our 10,000 small business programs. In addition, we launched a COVID-19 relief fund with $30 million commitment through Goldman Sachs Gives, including a special employee matching grant program to help healthcare workers, families and the most vulnerable populations. Lastly, in response to the well-publicized shortage of equipment for health professionals, we continued to donate supplies to frontline workers who need the most. Across the U.S. and Europe, we have donated 2.5 million surgical masks and 700,000 N95 masks, which we acquired over a number of years following prior epidemics like SARS as a part of our operational risk management efforts. As the situation rapidly evolves, we will continue to adapt our response for supporting the broader financial system, our clients, our people and our communities. More broadly, these are defining times for organizations. Adversity compels us to innovate, to leverage new technologies and to find new ways of thinking and interacting. At Goldman Sachs, we have always prided ourselves of doing that to help our clients succeed and we continue to execute on this commitment as we move forward. With that context, I will turn to the quarter on Page 2 of the earnings presentation to discuss our financial results. In the first quarter, net revenues were $8.7 billion, roughly flat versus a year ago. Net earnings were $1.2 billion resulting in earnings per share of $3.11 and ROE of 5.7% and a return on tangible equity of 6%. The first quarter proved to be two very different operating periods with a solid January and February followed by a challenging and volatile backdrop in March. In both contexts, our franchise businesses performed well. From a client perspective, we maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor to our investment banking clients in period of stress. We delivered solid growth in FICC and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in March. We continue to advise our wealth management clients and accelerated deposit growth in our digital consumer banking business. In asset management, we saw direct impact from market dislocation as our on-balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material mark-to-market losses from falling asset prices. We also recognized higher credit losses and bolstered our reserves. Challenges notwithstanding we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with capital ratios above our minimum and robust levels of liquidity. Importantly, our franchise remains strong and we feel well-positioned to deliver best-in-class advice, execution and risk expertise to every client engagement. Turning to the operating environment on Page 3, the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment. Our business performed well in both January and February as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence in activity. This backdrop however deteriorated with unprecedented speed in early March as financial markets began to brisance [ph] of the severe risks from the spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the dramatic measures needed to contain it. We witnessed spikes and volatility across most financial assets and global markets. The S&P 500 declined sharply from all-time highs in February and the VIX hit new highs. We also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investment grade and high yield and de-risking from clients across all asset classes. Given our strong financial position, we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global market franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure. The very high levels of activity demonstrate the strength and scope of our franchise and our ability to serve clients as an important risk intermediary. Looking forward, our economists expect a very significant near-term decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about 50% of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters. More specifically, annualized U.S. GDP is forecasted to decline in excess of 30% in the second quarter before recovering in the third and fourth quarters resulting in an economic contraction of about 6% of the year. This compares to growth expectations of over 2% just a few months ago. There is obviously a wide range of uncertainty around forward projections given the unknown duration of the health crisis. The reality is that none of us know for sure. This is why it is critically important during this difficult period that we maintain a strong financial profile and remain agile and flexible in our service to our clients. Lastly, I\u2019ll share a few comments on our Investor Day commitments. While January seems distant under these circumstances, more distant under these circumstances than the ten or so weeks that have passed, the strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling. Strengthening our core businesses, expanding in new and adjacent businesses, and operating with greater efficiency, remain ever important to the firm. We established targets that contemplated in normal operating environment. And clearly, this is not a normal operating environment. Yet our targets represent medium and long-term goals, which we still aspire to. Interestingly, this environment has created opportunities for us to accelerate our strategic plans in certain areas. Our transaction banking rollout remains on track and our growth in corporate deposits has exceeded expectations. In our alternatives business, we have accelerated fundraising on a strategic solution fund of meaningful size to help clients take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. In our high net worth business, we completed our re-branding of United Capital, the Goldman Sachs\u2019 personal financial management on schedule in March, and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business. You should expect us to manage through the current environment dynamically with our priorities of serving clients and protecting the long-term value of our franchise. We will adjust our tactical response as appropriate, which may impact the timing, cadence of the size of certain investments. That says our strategic goals remain in place. As we execute, we look forward on updating you \u2013 to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David. Good morning to you all. Let me begin with our summary results on page 4. During the first quarter, three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of 20% versus the year ago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in March. These results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our long-term investments in equity, debt securities, and loans. We also took a material provision for credit losses in the quarter. Despite the difficult backdrop, our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago, reflecting the diversification of our businesses. Before turning specifically to our results, I want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the U.S. banking system coming into this period of volatility, in terms of capital, liquidity and risk. I also want to provide insight into where Goldman Sachs stands on those metrics as we enter the second quarter. The industry came into this market dislocation with a robust financial position, as the capital levels for large banks, more than doubled over the past decade to approximately $1 trillion. Our capital stands above our minimums, with the reduction in our CET1 ratio during the quarter, a reflection of a very purposeful deployment of balance sheet on behalf of clients. As David noted, our liquidity is very strong, averaging over $240 billion during the quarter and remains at a level higher than that now. Our risk positions remain balanced, controlled, and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. Our ability to serve as a principle intermediary of risk, the source of liquidity and a provider of balance sheet, on behalf of clients is rooted in the sound financial footing of the firm and our long history of being a firm that clients turn to in challenging moments. Across Goldman Sachs, our forward planning and risk management practices enabled us to be well prepared. The liquidity and capital buffers we hold are intended for times like these, and we prudently deploy our financial resources to serve our clients during the first quarter. As a function of the regular stress testing that we and the industry have undertaken over the past decade, our liquidity and capital metrics are sized to withstand severely adverse scenarios. During the time of increased market volatility and disruption, our ability to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people, the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization. In short, Goldman Sachs is open for business. Let\u2019s turn to our business performance on Page 5 beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 25% versus a year ago quarter. First quarter financial advisory revenues of $781 million were down 9% sequentially and down 11% versus last year amid fewer deal closings, consistent with lower industry volumes. During the quarter, we participated in nearly $250 billion of announced transactions and closed 68 deals for nearly $200 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A league table rankings. We continue to engage with clients about significant changes in the economic environment and the implications for the M&A business. Given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries, we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance, bolstering balance sheets, hedging market and financial risks, and capturing strategic opportunities. While there are clearly some industries that are more directly impacted than others, dialogs with clients are at elevated levels across all verticals, as this crisis impacts clients of all types and in all regions. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $378 million were flat versus the fourth quarter and up 44% versus a slow period for IPOs in the first quarter of last year. For the quarter, we ranked number two globally in equity underwriting, with $12 billion in volume across 80 transactions, as we executed a number of key IPOs during the first two months of the quarter. Additionally, following the market pullback, we helped a number of clients raise capital in the convertible market through public and private transactions. Notably, we led a number of high-profile-type issuances for a variety of companies, including Wayfair and Twitter. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $583 million, down 3% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% from a year ago. Activity this quarter reflected growth in asset-backed and leverage finance activity. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our Number 4 global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investment grade and below investment grade markets, even through the challenging environment in March. As David mentioned, in the last two full weeks of March, we saw record U.S. dollar investment grade issuance with over $170 billion of activity. Of that, Goldman Sachs helped raise nearly $75 billion of financing for clients, capturing over 13% share, roughly double versus last year, evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access. Helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments, as certain bridge in other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets. Our investment banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter but rose versus a year ago. Given the environment, we expect announcement timelines on several larger transactions in our backlog to be delayed. That said, we maintain active dialogs with clients across our global franchise and know that market conditions can evolve quickly. Revenues from corporate lending were $442 million, nearly double the fourth quarter and up over three-fold versus a year ago, driven by approximately $375 million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter. We maintain single-name hedges on certain larger commitments as a prudent risk management tool. The hedge gains could, of course, reverse in future quarters should credit spreads tighten. As a reminder, corporate lending includes middle-market lending, relationship lending and acquisition financing. In the quarter, gains on single-name and index hedges as well as net interest income on the portfolio more than offset fair value marks on our acquisition financing commitments. During the quarter, we saw approximately $19 billion of corporate commitment draw-downs in relationship lending as we supported our clients\u2019 liquidity needs during this difficult time. While we saw a higher percentage of draw-downs from our non-investment grade clients, given the larger size of our investment grade book, the $19 billion was roughly evenly split on a notional basis between investment grade and non-investment grade. These draws were within our expectations for a stress scenario and were below the amount pre-funded in our liquidity pool. During this period, we also saw significant inflows in commercial deposit accounts tied to our new transaction banking platform. These deposit balances totaled $9 billion and we\u2019re now serving over 80 clients, reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy. Moving to Global Markets on Page 6, net revenues were $5.2 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially and up 28% versus last year. Growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bid-ask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market. As we noted at our Investor Day, our results in global markets, like all segments, include fully allocated costs. As such, our reported quarterly results in global markets were burdened by a charge of approximately $500 million related to valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with widening of credit and funding spreads. FICC net revenues were $3 billion, up 68% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year. Growth versus last year was driven by an 18% increase in financing and 36% growth in intermediation revenues. Within FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses, with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year; again, reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified FICC franchise. In currencies, we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the Americas and Asia. We continued to on-board new clients to our Marquee and eFX platforms during the quarter, and produced record results in this business, reflecting our significant investments in recent years, changing client workflows, and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress. Our rates franchise also performed well, given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as central banks around the world cut rates and the Fed and ECB launched significant quantitative easing programs. In commodities, our business delivered strong results in oil, as we worked with our clients to manage extraordinary price volatility. We also generated solid performance in metals. These positive results were partly offset by CVA from wider counterparty credit spreads. In credit, our performance was solid across our global franchise. We benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index CDS products and notably in client portfolio trades, which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory. Like in our currencies business, our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise, capital commitment, and the efficiency of our digital platforms. In mortgages, net revenues fell, as significantly higher client activity was offset by wider spreads impacting our inventory, particularly in agencies, as we saw de-leveraging across the market. Importantly, our performance was cushioned by the capital and risk reduction measures we executed over the past several years. Lastly in FICC financing, we saw a considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets, which have begun to normalize in recent weeks. Turning to equities, on Page 7, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion, up 28% versus the fourth quarter and up 22% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 32% versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes. This was partially offset by a more difficult market making backdrop in Europe, given unexpected dividend cuts. Equities financing revenues of $666 million rose 4% year-over-year, driven by higher average quarterly, prime client balances. Moving to asset management on Page 8, collectively, our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of $96 million in the first quarter, first quarter management and other fees totaled $640 million, up 5% versus a year ago, driven by higher client assets under supervision. Incentive fees increased to $154 million driven primarily by asset harvesting, including closing a key Special Purpose Acquisition Company or SPAC transaction. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by marks on our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Losses here reflect the sharp market declines during the quarter, given the majority of our assets in this segment are accounted for at fair value. Our equity investments produced $22 million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or close sale of certain investments in January and February were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in March. More specifically on our $19 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of approximately $775 million from event driven items including agreements to sell our investment in a UK student housing portfolio and our investment in AirTrunk, a datacenter in Australia. Gains from these dispositions were offset by approximately $500 million of marks on our private equity positions, reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly $500 million of marks on our $2 billion public equity portfolio including $180 million loss on Avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were a negative $868 million attributable to mark to market losses on debt securities and fair value loans. As shown on Page 9, this segment houses a $29 billion credit portfolio including $13 billion of fair value debt securities and $16 billion of corporate and real estate loans, of which $4 billion are held at fair value. This portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multi-strategy investing teams, which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years. That said, in the first quarter, the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself. This drove significant losses across the portfolio of senior and mezzanine corporate loans and our broader portfolio of liquid corporate debt securities. As we go forward, we will continue to risk manage the credit portfolio, prudently. With respect to loans, while the majority of the portfolio is non-investment grade by design, it is well structured and over 85% is secured. We also would note that if spreads retrace, as they have in the first part of the second quarter, we could recoup a portion of the first quarter\u2019s losses. But of course, there is no assurance of that outcome. Turning to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page 10, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $959 million rose 21% versus last year, reflecting both organic growth and the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision rose 6% versus the prior year to $509 billion. We also saw higher incentive fees, while private banking and lending revenues declined. Consumer banking revenues were $282 million in the first quarter, rising nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $72 billion across the U.S. and UK reflecting a record $12 billion of quarterly growth in the consumer platform. Performance in March was solid with $4 billion of monthly growth, providing a valuable source of funding to the firm. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion of which $5 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $2 billion from credit card. Going forward, we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both Marcus unsecured loans and Apple Card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation. Now let\u2019s turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total client assets for which we earn a management fee, including those in asset management and consumer and wealth management, totaled $1.8 trillion in the first quarter, down $41 billion versus the fourth quarter, but up $219 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $114 billion of market depreciation offset by $72 billion of liquidity and $1 billion of long-term inflows. Switching gears on Page 12, let\u2019s address net interest income and our lending portfolio. Total firm-wide net interest income was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, up 23% sequentially, reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $128 billion, up $19 billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $937 million, up $600 million versus last quarter. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $131 million resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 0.5%. On the wholesale portfolio, we took impairments and bolstered our reserves, particularly for loans in the oil and gas sector given recent price declines. In our consumer portfolio, provisions related to markets were higher versus last quarter due primarily to CECL reserve rates even though realized net charge-offs declined. Additionally, we note out provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under CECL which we adopted as planned. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses stood at $3.2 billion. Our allowance for funded loans under accrual accounting was 2.5%. Overall, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations given the recent economic deterioration. That said we continued to monitor the portfolio and brought our risk factors closely and will take any and all mitigating actions as appropriate. One area of particular focus is our lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector. At the end of March, we had approximately $14 billion of total lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector, net of roughly $600 million of hedges. Approximately $4 billion were funded loans. Our total exposure is diversified, with no single counterparty over $500 million before hedges just over half is non-investment grade of which over 70% is secured. And as a proportion of our overall wholesale credit book, our oil and gas exposure remains very manageable. Now, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.5 billion increased 10% versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity. Higher provisions for litigation and an increase in expenses related to real estate consolidated investments, including impairments. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources consistent with our historical focus on expense discipline and the emphasis on cost control at Investor Day we will assess the timing, magnitude and pace of certain expenses and investments. Importantly, we continue to pursue our medium-term efficiency target. To that end, we expect to realize the effect of planned reductions in non-compensation expenses more significantly through the back half of the year. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 10% for the first quarter. Our lower rate reflected the impact of share-based compensation awards and the lower impact or \u2013 and the impact of lower pre-tax earnings on permanent benefits. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to select balance sheet data, on Slide 14, let me begin with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 80 basis points sequentially driven by balance sheet and RWA growth in light of our meaningful client engagement during the quarter. Our ratio under the advanced approach decreased by 140 basis points to 12.3%, with the incremental decline versus standardized due to higher credit spread volatility. Our SLR was 5.9%, down 30 basis points sequentially also on balance sheet deployment to clients. This quarter, we returned a total of $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases notably at the beginning of the quarter and common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 356 million shares. As you will recall, Goldman Sachs and members of the Financial Services Forum voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend buybacks through the second quarter of 2020. This pause allows us to continue to deploy our resources to support our clients in the context of the current operating environment. We remain committed to allocating capital to accretive high return opportunities and when not deployed returning excess to shareholders. As it relates to our dividend, given our continued earnings generation and solid capital position, we feel comfortable maintaining our dividend. Further to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, up 10% versus last quarter. We maintained strong liquidity levels. As referenced earlier, our global core liquid assets averaged a record $243 billion, up $6 billion versus the fourth quarter. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $220 billion, up $30 billion versus last quarter with strong flows through our Marcus and transaction banking channels. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy to remix our liabilities to our deposits. Our total unsecured long-term borrowings were $226 billion driven by $15.7 billion of vanilla debt issuance during the quarter as we accelerated issuance into the first quarter from what was intended for the back part of this year to better position ourselves to be in the service of our clients. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise. As we look toward the balance of the year, we take strength from our robust financial position, including capital and liquidity. Our client franchise remains strong and with the ongoing dedication of the talented professionals of Goldman Sachs, we will marshal the full resources of the firm to serve our clients during this unprecedented time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we will now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Appreciate it. I guess the tough one on getting you to talk about the linearity of reserves as possible, meaning you laid out the macro backdrop that you have taken reserves under if we roll forward a quarter, the world is a little worse or just delayed. Could you talk about how reserves shift as we shift out a quarter meaning if you \u2013 if we start thinking that the economic recovery is more like a 2021 event instead of second half event? Could you talk about the $937 million provision taken relative to how that changes with the pushing out of a recovery? I know that\u2019s a hard one. Stephen Scherr : Sure, Glenn. Thank you. So as you know, the provision for credit loss we took was $937 million, about $686 million of that were in provisions and about $200 million of that related to the relationship loan book with the balance really guided by the crisis relating to COVID and growth in the overall portfolio. In answering your question, I will point out what we did in this quarter, because I think it will reflect a process that we will continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios, one that\u2019s optimistic, a base case and one that\u2019s downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesn\u2019t rely exclusively on our economist, but takes a broad look. And obviously, we don\u2019t know what the forward holds in the quarter. And so I think we will hone to the very same process we did, which is looking at a variety of scenarios, putting enough weight on a downside or a base case, or for that matter, one that\u2019s marginally more optimistic. It\u2019s worth pointing out that in these scenarios we take a look at what the contraction of GDP is. We look at unemployment, but we don\u2019t ignore the fact that there are a number of programs in place across a range of countries notably the U.S. where central banks and treasuries have put in place monitoring fiscal stimulus that has the potential to serve as some counterbalance, if you will, to what may play to the extent that holds and that accelerates a recovery. I have every expectation that reserves would reflect it if this continued on and that didn\u2019t have the efficacy that is otherwise intended one could imagine a scenario that plays more to the downside and I would expect provisions and losses to reflect the same. And so again hard to predict what the next quarter or subsequent quarters hold, but I think will rely and you should know that will rely on a pretty robust modeling exercise that will reflect to circumstances that we see in front of us. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Maybe one follow-up on the investment portfolios within asset management and I appreciate the detail you gave. Maybe you could help one on Part A and Part B one on equity, one on debt, on the equity side public are the publics and were down about in line with what the markets were. The private side is only a few percent so if you could talk to what differentiated about the portfolio and cash flow and composition and the diversity of it and why would warrant a lesser mark. And the different question on the debt side, debt lending side, the marks were pretty robust there given the spread widening, just curious if all of that was mark-to-market and nothing sold because spreads have obviously improved so far in April? Thank you. Stephen Scherr : No, not a problem. So, let me give you kind of quick decomposition and I will start with equity. So we have a $21 billion equity portfolio, $19 billion of that is in private, $2 billion of that is in the public space. When you look at the P&L around it, I would say that on the positive side we realized about $775 million of gain principally generated around the harvesting of assets one as I mentioned being the UK housing platform and the other being the AirTrunk asset in Australia. So that generated positive revenues of $775 million. Also embedded in this was a $200 million revenue pickup in the context of CIEs that we keep independent of the equity portfolio. So think of that portfolio generating positive $1 billion or so. That was offset by both public and private mark. So in the public realm, we took down about $500 million of loss most notable within that was a $180 million of Avantor. On the $500 million of losses in the balance of the private portfolio that was spread across about 280 names. And so it\u2019s important just to understand that dispersion. I would also say that when you look at the private portfolio, you don\u2019t hone exclusively to kind of public market comparables, you look at the underlying performance of those businesses. And just to give you a little bit of insight into that, of that private portfolio, I would say 65% of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business, about 20% of that portfolio was impacted by COVID and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then 15% of portfolio was what\u2019s on positive gains in the harvesting that was there. Just to give you a breakdown and the reliance on underlying performance and/or events and not the exclusive reliance on a public sort of analog in terms of looking at that private portfolio. Let me turn now to answer your question on the debt side. So there it\u2019s a $29 billion portfolio, about $17 billion of that is fair value. So debt securities about $13 billion, loans about $4 billion, the balance of $12 billion are loans on an accrual basis. And so as you can imagine, the mark-to-market on the fair value was largely influenced by dramatic spread widening that was experienced in the quarter. We saw high yield spreads in the U.S. gap out by about 375 basis points, the same in Europe gapped out by about 435 basis points. Now as I noted, we have seen some retrenchment of that in the beginning part of the second quarter that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good as it related to marks taken in the first quarter, but just to give you a sense of the markets retrenchment as we began early. Now we will see what the rest of the quarter holds, but that just gives you a sense of balance in the context of both the acuity and the credit portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead sir. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe first on sustainability of FICC strength, I think a sequential quarter performance of up 68% is probably the best of all banks that reported so far. So are you finally seeing payoff from your growth initiatives and feel actual share gains in this business? And then just given the strength of performance and more importantly the countercyclical nature of the business, does it change how you think about allocating capital to FICC over time? David Solomon : Sure. Thanks, Christian. I will start and Stephen might jump in. We have been \u2013 two parts of your question in my mind, the first is we have been very committed, this management team over the last 18 months, to running the diversified fixed income business at a point in time where the ability to differentiate in the intermediation part of that business was harder. We were in a very low volatility environment for a long period of time. You have seen us stay committed to a diverse business, where in some years some businesses do well, some businesses do poorly, but we really as we have reoriented the client focus of the organization, we believe that a full service platform would, through cycles, payoff for us. We have spent a lot of time really thinking about the way we connect with clients and the way we are servicing clients and trying to make that business over the last year less transaction-oriented and more client-oriented. Those investments based on the feedback we have and data we have having nothing to do with COVID have borne progress over the course of the last year, from a market share perspective both on an objective basis and also from a subjective feedback we are getting from our clients. In this quarter, you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity. I am watching all the reporting of the other banks as you are. We think we benefited meaningfully from that because of the way we have invested in that business and we are well-positioned. How it continues going forward will depend on the environment and what the environment brings. In an environment that continues to have more elevated volatility and more changes in risk patterns for our clients, I think our franchise will continue to benefit. In terms of capital allocation, I think we have got the right amount of capital in that business, but look, you saw the operating leverage in that business when you look at the returns in that business based on how we are operating now. So again, we have always thought about through the cycle. I think our team performed very, very well in this business. I am glad we have stayed in the broad array of businesses given the environment that we are now in, but you will only be able to judge whether we have got the capital right and we stay zealously focused on this as we continue to run through the cycle. But we have no plans to change the capital allocation at the moment, other than to try to accommodate clients we grew risk weighted assets in the business which obviously attracts capital. We will continue to do that if it\u2019s attractive and it supports our clients. Stephen Scherr : Christian, good morning. Couple of things I would add to David\u2019s answer, first to his point on capital allocation, it\u2019s bearing note as we report now in ways we hadn\u2019t before that FICC produced an ROE of 19.7%. And the reflection of the nimbleness and agility of capital, which was a topic discussed at our Investor Day is the ability to deploy capital where it\u2019s required and needed by our clients. And that\u2019s the way balance sheet flows in and around the firm and within the firm in terms of capital allocation. I\u2019d also point out that I think this business benefited and you heard us talk about this over the preceding one or two earnings calls where we took risk down generally speaking within this business. And so as a consequence, we came into this crisis with a more manageable risk profile and we are able to manage flows and be in the service of intermediating clients more thoroughly. I should point out as I may have misspoken, but growth markets producing ROE as a segment of 19.7%, but obviously FICC a big contributor to it in the context of our overall performance. David Solomon : The only other thing Christian I would add is that we have also been making significant investments in technology platforms to better serve our clients in this business and we saw a real benefit especially with everybody working remote on our technology connectivity and our platforms. And we think that\u2019s an investment that has paid off. Christian Bolu : Great. Thank you for the color. Maybe switching to the loan book I think the loan book has more than doubled over the last 3 years and has been a real source of revenue growth for the firm. I am just looking forward how are you thinking about loan growth both in terms of customer demand and your risk appetite to lend into global recession? Stephen Scherr : So Christian, I will take that question. Look the abiding proposition for us obviously is to maintain appropriate risk management and equally be mindful of capital and liquidity and so taking those three as kind of the abiding governors. I have every expectation that the firm will continue both aggressively and offensively to extend credit in the interest of clients across a range of our businesses and equally to meet our client needs in the context of corporate draw-downs or other liquidity needs of the client itself. The book obviously stands at $128 billion. There was meaningful growth in the quarter occasioned by the relationship loan book being drawn by about $19 billion. But I think risk is obviously an important governor. And so I would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book wherever committed to that business, but at this moment, in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and will return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First question just a follow-up on the asset management business and thanks for all the color so far. On the private equity portfolio versus the public equity portfolio, historically, how much of the valuations tend to be fairly close to the public markets versus what could we expect on a lag basis if the challenging backdrop ends up continuing? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So the philosophy that we brought and the accounting rigor we brought to marking our private portfolio frankly has not at all changed this quarter relative to what it has been historically. Meaning, we always look at events that play out as a reference point against which names or companies in which there has been an event either a sale or another investment into that name we market in that context, where there is in an event, we look at the underlying performance in the business in just the way I described we did it this way. And so underlying \u2013 the underlying performance of those businesses is having the true north in the way in which we look to mark that portfolio. Now as we look forward to the extent that we come into a quarter or multiple quarters, which ultimately weigh on the underlying performance and the underlying profitability of that portfolio company or set of companies, you are obviously then could be further marks and loss occasion by that and that would therefore be a lag. But I just want to layout the methodology we use in the context of how we market and equally point out that this quarter is no different than any other in the way in which we mark that book. Michael Carrier : Okay, that makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, results in trading and banking held up well and I realized it\u2019s impossible to predict or to have too much clarity, but can you help us out or provide some context or color on where you are continuing to see elevated activity versus the areas where we could expect some normalization or falloff just given some of the pockets that we have seen over the past 9 months? David Solomon : Sure, Michael. I mean, I will take a stab at talking a little bit about that. First in the investment banking business, the advisory business is always a lag. So we have a backlog of M&A deals that were struck earlier. Many of them will continue to close. That will bring some revenue into the second quarter. But as we go longer and we continue to be in an environment where there is very, very low confidence obviously as you witnessed over the last few weeks, there has been very little new M&A activity that\u2019s been initiated. During the time of low confidence, I would expect that to continue. So over time, the velocity of revenue accrual on the M&A side will slow until we get to a period of higher confidence. With respect to the financing side of the investment banking business, you have obviously seen in the last few weeks record levels of investment grade issuance, one record week after another and so debt financing has been very strong. You have seen some equity issuance and certainly with more stability in equity markets or companies are trying to bolster their balance sheet, bolster their liquidity and position themselves to ride out what maybe a longer period of economic contraction. That actually should accrue to our benefit in that business, because I think we are well positioned to capture our fair share of providing that liquidity and financing support. In the trading businesses in the early part of the quarter, we have seen heightened level of activity in the early part of the quarter. There is no guarantee obviously that continues as we go through the quarter, but in the early part of the quarter, we have seen our investing clients continue to be very, very active. I think we are going through a period \u2013 we were going through March period of significant de-risking. We have now been going through a period of repositioning. So our clients have been active. As you point out, it\u2019s very hard to say what that\u2019s going to look like 2, 3 months from now, but that\u2019s the view I give you at the moment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off with a question on funding, one of the biggest drivers of the ROTCE build you laid out at Investor Day was the $1 billion benefit from funding optimization and retracted deposit costs pretty closely. We have seen a lot of your competitors aggressively match the Fed rate cuts, but you maintained very competitive deposit payouts, certainly help contribute to strong deposit growth this quarter. I was just hoping if you could update us on how your deposit strategy is evolving in the low rate environment and whether the flat yield curve and still elevated deposit payouts could impact that $1 billion funding benefit you cited out yesterday? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thank you, Steve. So let me start with sort of strategy around rate. We took our rate down actually yesterday in the U.S. relative to where it had been. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard, which is we aim to be certainly not the top rate payer, but somewhere in the 3 or 4 category and we will continue to do that with an eye towards building out greater product attributes and a more formidable relationship with depositors such that we rely less on rate in the context of both drawing and maintaining deposits, but it\u2019s against that strategy that we saw at least for us record inflows on the deposit side. In terms of the medium-term target which we set out in Investor Day of achieving $1 billion of savings occasioned by the migration of our funding mix, that\u2019s no less an imperative for us now than it was then. And I would simply point out that the market will pull some volatility into the measurement. So again, this is a medium-term target that we will achieve. We will move closer and closer to 50% of our funding in deposits, the amount or the delta of savings, if you will, will be both a function of where we take deposit rates and as much as where wholesale funding obviously takes itself. And I think particularly in this market and most notably in March, this was a really good very stable source of funding for us, but I think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we have talked about over the medium term is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that. And just for my follow-up relating to expense management, I wanted to unpack some of your comments a bit more, you talked about savings initiatives helping reduce non-comps in the back half of this year, but just in terms of the near-term outlook, are you still comfortable with maintaining I believe the guidance was calling for flat non-comps, ex-litigation in 2020? And just given some of the recent disruption from COVID, whether that has informed or changed your strategy around executing on the long-term savings target of $1.3 billion? Stephen Scherr : So there is no change relating to our medium-term target of achieving $1.3 billion. Now the early pace of that during this period of pandemic will obviously be slower, but this is a medium term or 3-year target and I think we will come out of this experience leaving clearer view as to sort of where changes can be made and where we can harvest expense reduction. In the near-term I am very much minded to achieve flat non-comp expense relative to where we were, but let me just be open and point to the variables. One is obviously, BC&E this is a variable expense that obviously plays in the context of market activity. We have seen more of it. And so as a consequence, we have seen more expense in that regard. On consolidated investments, it would have been my preference in a common market for us to have exited more of those consolidated investments and shed ourselves of some of those expenses whether the market permits that to happen over the balance of the year we will have to see. Obviously honing to flat non-comp was ex-litigation so I am just leaving that aside, but the two variables really just to be candid about it are BC&E relative to volumes and CIEs to the extent we can harvest it. Otherwise, we are quite focused on trying to sort of live to a flat non-comp expense year-over-year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, I just wanted to test your conviction on how much of a counterbalance, the economy should have for the monetary and fiscal actions and your conviction seems to be important, because it goes to your provisioning level which you said we had considered as part of that provision and the pace of additional financing for your clients and frankly for the advice that you give to your clients, I mean you are the biggest advisor to your corporations out there, I mean, what are you telling them as far as how they should proceed? David Solomon : So, thanks, Mike. I will start, Stephen might join in, but you are asking a multi-layered question. So on the first part of the question, there is no question that the response, the fiscal and monetary response is going to have a simulative effect, there is no question. When we come out of this and I am not making a prediction of when we will come out of it, but when we come out of it, it will have a stimulative effect versus a scenario where it didn\u2019t exist. The question that\u2019s so hard to answer and in my conversations with clients on having it constantly, we have to rebuild confidence in people\u2019s security and safety around the virus. We can all have economic forecast and we can all talk about the economic consequence of this, but unless people feel safe and secured and confident around the virus, the economic impact will continue in some way, shape or form. That is a very, very hard thing to predict. So I tried to encourage companies that we have talked to and individuals for that matter to hope for the better, but plan for the worst. And so certainly I think if you are trying to prepare for an economic environment, you have to view something that is a slower economic recovery as you come out of this. And look even if you look at the Goldman Sachs scenario was a very steep decline with a sharp increase in the second and third quarter they are still only predicting a 50% recovery of the output that was lost. So, I think for anybody operating a business you have to be planning on an assumption that we are going to be operating in a recession through 2020 into 2021 and you have to plan accordingly. Will the monetary policy and fiscal policy be a benefit to the positive of what that trajectory looks like in the third, fourth quarter and into the first half of next year? Yes, but it\u2019s very hard to quantify what that will be, because the uncertainty around the course that the virus will take and how it will affect human behavior is still very uncertain and anyone who is telling you they are sure that it will look like this or they are sure that it will look that, I don\u2019t think anybody is sure. And so I think this will be a gradual path. And as we have more information we will be able to better evaluate. What we are trying to do is ensure that in our organization where risk managing and provisioning appropriately as we can based on the information we can looking forward with that kind of a mindset. Mike Mayo : Well, the other part of the question is given that how aggressively are you pursuing financing at this time to gain share by stepping in when others might not? David Solomon : Look, we are actively \u2013 we are focused on helping our clients across the organization. If you look at investment grade, you take an investment grade which has been very, very obvious and transparent. We picked up significant share over the course of the last four weeks. And so we think we are well-positioned to capture share. We are going to do it with prudent and a long-term view of our client franchise. And so we are long-term investors on our client franchise we always have been. There isn\u2019t an institution that does not have to make certain choices around how it allocates its capital at a time like this. We think we are good at that. We think we are nimble. But of course, we are going to lean into our client relationships and take a long-term view. Stephen Scherr : Mike, I also would say that as a by-product of advice, if you look at the roster of corporations that have issued into both the investment grade and below investment grade markets what you will find are companies that are in certain industries that have been meaningfully impacted by the virus yet saw the utility of taking access in the market so that they can better weather the storm and the uncertainty that\u2019s in the market itself. You also saw issuers who are not impacted to the same extent, but they too saw the utility of tapping the market and looking to take themselves to the other side of this moment of volatility and sort of comport themselves and carry their business that way. And I think that\u2019s a reflection of advice we and certainly others have been giving to issuing clients. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kian Abouhossein : Thanks for taking my question. The first question is related to your comments on your global market equities, you mentioned the dislocation in dividends and I was wondering if you could give quantify the impact that it had on your results? And in that context on equities also we clearly hear that a lot of investment banks have been having gamma positions. In that context, I was hoping if its material if you could indicate if that was a positive or negative impact on your results as well? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So what we experienced in equities over the quarter was the negative consequence of the suspension by certain companies of dividends, mostly in Europe and so it had a European tilt to it relative to other geographies. I wouldn\u2019t call this out as being material. I am not in a position to callout the precision of its impact, but I would say that there were certain industries that were subject to kind of an outright suspension of dividends, there were others in the context of the circumstances of the virus that we are unable to convene AGMs and as a consequence could not declare dividend. Obviously, we facilitate client flows that trade and dividends, it\u2019s a bigger business in Europe than elsewhere and the consequence of those suspensions was a negative impact to overall revenue in that business, but nothing that I would call out as being material. Kian Abouhossein : And in respect to looking at the trends through the quarter basically we are trying to understand a little bit, how is the sales and trading franchise impacted and you clearly mentioned at the beginning that the first half was excellent, the second half was dislocated, but clearly the trading revenues and volumes when you look at the volumes were holding up extremely well. And generally, in a downturn what we see is dry up of volumes which we haven\u2019t really seen. So just from your experience how should we think first of all about the trend line that we saw through the quarter if you can comment on that both on fixed income sales and trading equities? And secondly, how should we think about the trends generally for the industry when we compare to historic levels, where we really see a dry up post a material dislocation or decline in markets? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Go ahead. David Solomon : You go ahead. Stephen Scherr : No, no, I was just going to comment that, I can speak to the trend that we saw in the quarter and David can offer some further comment of what we are seeing in the beginning of the second to the extent that sustains itself. But while David rightly pointed out that the quarter was on one hand January and February and then on the other hand March. In March, we saw very high volumes through our sales and trading businesses and took advantage of that at wider bid offer spreads. I would also point out that and particularly using marquee and some of our electronic platforms we were engaging in very large portfolio trades on behalf of clients. And I think those electronic platforms were busy and were useful, particularly because it\u2019s not just we who are at a work from home posture, but equally clients were. And so these digital platforms across geographies proved to be quite useful and it proved to be a positive consequence to the overall P&L and certainly to the business of sales and trading. To the extent that continues to play forward one could assume you would see the very same phenomenon, but that\u2019s difficult obviously to project. David Solomon : I don\u2019t have anything really to add. I think we have kind of covered this. The first part of the quarter, things were going well on the trading business as the customer activity of the trading business has accelerated in March and it\u2019s continued to remain just in the first 2 weeks higher than what we would have seen as an average level of activity before the crisis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I am sorry I wanted to circle back on the provision assumptions, I know you have spoken about it a couple of times, but it\u2019s just so little confusing to me because I am not \u2013 you have referenced sort of what the Goldman Sachs economists think, but it seemed as though you suggested that\u2019s not what was necessarily an input into your own provision assumptions? And then I think David you referenced a recession when advising clients that a recession might go into 2021, but I am not sure whether or not that was the advice to clients or whether that was the input into provisioning? And I think Steven you referenced three scenarios, could you maybe give a little bit more clarity on what those assumptions are? And given that you have both debt securities and loans when we look at the debt securities, should we like add in the mark you took which looks like about a 7% mark on the $17 billion that you laid out as almost like a quasi provision and how we think about it holistically? Thank you. David Solomon : Okay. So, Brennan, I am going to start and then I will pass to Steven to talk about the provision stuff, but first, we are mixing certain things. I was asked a question about advice to clients and I am going to be a little bit more specific in my words. We all understand that a recession is two quarters in a row of economic decline. Okay, and if we looked at the Goldman Sachs scenario that would say there would be a recession in the first and second quarter, but we would then have economic growth in the third and fourth quarter that wouldn\u2019t technically be a recession. However, if you are advising clients and you took the Goldman Sachs economic model that said that you only recovered 50% of the output that you lost and the decline in output during the first and second quarter. And so if you are giving someone an advice about how to position the business even though technically we wouldn\u2019t be in a recession as you got to the end of the year in early 2021, we would not have recovered the output that had decline. And so certainly if you are operating a lot of these businesses, it\u2019s still going to feel like you are operating in recession. And so the advice to clients is to think about when you get your business back to where it was and that obviously takes a longer time. That\u2019s client advice. That has nothing to do at all with how we model or think about our provisioning. And I will let Stephen go talk about that a little bit more. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So Brennan, let me just \u2013 let me directly address your question on kind of process and what we go through. So we obviously have an independent risk group that assigns and works with controllers to an economic scenario that serves as a backdrop that influences the direction they take as they look name by name through both the equity and the credit portfolio. And so it is an input it is not a formula if you will that sort of bleeds out a percentage that\u2019s applied to the whole. Each name is reviewed in the portfolio. It\u2019s done by an independent risk group and that independent risk group uses as an input a macroeconomic backdrop that they assemble. There is no question that the Goldman Sachs Research Group is an input to that, but what puts out is not the sole determination. The independent risk group goes about establishing their perspective, their backdrop with that as an input, but not exclusive. And so that gives rise obviously to an environment against which our controllers approach every position in the book and ascribe an appropriate mark or reserve against it. And that\u2019s the process that we take. And the question you asked about the mark on our fair value debt and lending portfolio, I would just draw very big distinction between marks taken on that versus provisions, obviously, very different accounting regime depending upon the nature of the portfolio itself. I would also be very reluctant to try to ascribe a single percentage to the entire book because the duration on that book is very different meaning it runs a gamut. And so you need to be quite careful in the context of how you market. And so I just offer you that detail just to be super clear about the process we run. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you for all that color and clarification. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Quick \u2013 my follow-up being I think can you guys in your discussion with the equities business you flagged growth and balances of equity financing, but I believe Stephen, it was average balance and so given what happened in the quarter, the number might have been skewed. Are you seeing sustained strength in that average balance on the PB side just given some of the de-grossing we hear from some large hedge funds, it seemed to run counter, now you guys might be picking up share in that business. So just hoping to understand how it\u2019s proceeding here in 2Q? Thank you. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, your observation was the right one, which is average balances were up, end of period was lower and so just to avoid any confusion than that. I would say that there is nothing when we look out over the client base in prime that\u2019s to be called out as any particular category of client was challenged anymore than the other, meaning I think all of them whether it was quants, hedge funds and the like, all kind of were performing without any particular issue to be called out as against one or the other. I would say, it\u2019s a general observation that de-leveraging among that client base was less significant than perhaps one might imagine from the outside looking in, but again no particular issue and this is a business that remains strategically important to us as we continue to go forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Thank you. Good morning, David and Stephen. David Solomon : Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Devin Ryan : I guess first question here on just some of the puts and takes of the move in interest rates and obviously Goldman is going to be less levered to interest rate movements in some of the large banks, but just with the dramatic shift across the curve in the back half of the quarter, just if you can maybe help us think about some of the implications of the move on the model going forward whether it be on funding or revenues and then any other second derivatives, sounds like debt issuance might be one area of the benefits, but anything else we should be thinking about? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So as I\u2019ve said in the past and I sense from your own question, net interest income is roughly 15% of the firm\u2019s overall revenues and so it\u2019s not near the driver that it is for some of the larger big commercial banks. I think that if you look at where rate moves are and where interest rates have come, it probably plays more favorably to us in the context of funding. And I would point out that again apropos the answer I gave to the question on deposits as we continue to shift our funding mix with greater proportionality given to retail deposits and a bigger broader consumer business that will build, it will become less rate reliance. Rates will come down in that regard. And so our expectation is that this will play favorably to us more from a funding point of view than anything else, but it is not a big driver in the overall composition of firm-wide revenue. Devin Ryan : Sure. I appreciate that. And then just one on the investment banking outlook, obviously you heard the commentary on the backlog and debt issuance does not have the same lead time as M&A or IPOs for that matter. I am just curious if the expectation is that M&A and equity issuance are going to track the economic recovery, which obviously could be slower here or you are seeing signs of engagement with clients that could suggest maybe a more material snapback recovery as the economy opens back up? David Solomon : Yes. So, Devin I would say a couple of things on that first the engagement level with clients is extremely high, extremely high across the organization. And this is a different kind of recession. We were operating in economy that was really operating quite well with functionally fine and we turned it off with a sudden demand shock and that\u2019s kind of unprecedented and it\u2019s also unprecedented in that or it\u2019s uncertain in exactly how it turns back on and what the path of that is. And so I can see a lot of scenarios as there is a clear understanding of the trajectory of the virus and how the virus is going to affect kind of the reengagement economically of businesses across the economy that there will be an opportunity for more consolidation or some activity in a whole variety of industries that probably wouldn\u2019t have been anticipated had the economy just kept chugging along. So I am not going to predict that. But I would say engagement is high and I could certainly see that if we got to a place where the virus seemed under control and confidence was building, I think that level of engagement could potentially pickup quite quickly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on the impairment coming back to that, I think you guys told us that we really shouldn\u2019t look from -- on the private equity side, the direction of the public markets they don\u2019t necessarily reflect what\u2019s going on fundamentally with those private equity companies that we will have investment in, can you share with us some metrics we can look to from the outside to take a look at how those marks may move going forward? Stephen Scherr : Well, it would be hard to get, I mean shy of handing you a sheet which had every company and every industry. It would be hard to do that. I will just come back to the commentary I made before, which is $19 billion of private equity positions, two-thirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well. Now that doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to the conclusion that they will continue or that number doesn\u2019t come down, but in the quarter, they performed well. About 20% of them were directly impacted by the virus. We saw it in the operations of that business and then the balance obviously has been harvested roughly 15% producing the gains that we saw. And so it\u2019s the EBITDA performance of individual portfolio companies that really lays on and guides the direction that price action is allocated to those names. And so we think that we have invested in companies that have the capability as the going in investment thesis to sort of whether a variety of different economic environments. And I think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way, but it\u2019s not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sigee : Good morning. Thank you. You talked about your willingness to deploy more balance sheets when you see opportunities. I just wondered if you could talk more about what your expectations are for total balance sheet assets expanding further in the next couple of quarters and also risk weighted assets. So I wondered if you could talk about both aspects of that, the volume trends that you expect to see in terms of overall assets, but also the risk weighting inflation that we have seen and whether we need to be ready for more of that looking forward? Stephen Scherr : No, this is an excellent question. I appreciate you asking it. On one hand as David and I have said now many times on this call, part of the purposeful inflation of balance sheet and by extension risk weighted assets was in the utility of serving our clients and the history of this firm strategically has been for that to happen meaning balance sheet moves, because client demand is there. The counter to that is that from a prudent risk management prospective we set boundaries for ourselves as to sort of what the consequence and tolerable consequence of that should be on capital. And so we are obviously well north of where we would otherwise be invading buffers and so we have got flexibility in that regard and we equally need to be mindful of what the forward calendar maybe with respect to CCAR and SCB on the forward, but it\u2019s in the context of that, that we will be prudent in the expansion of balance sheet and risk-weighted assets mindful of where we think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be from a capital point of view again given the fluid and attending guidepost that the regulatory issues will have for us. And so that push and pull continues, but we feel quite comfortable with where we are and with our ability to continue to put balance sheet in deployment at the service of our clients. Stephen Scherr : Okay. Since we \u2013 there are no further questions, I would like to take a moment just to thank everybody for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. We obviously wish you all well in the context of this environment. If there are any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today July 15, 2020. Thank you, Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Thanks, Dennis. Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr. David will start by reviewing the second quarter and first half performance. He will then provide an update on several key strategic growth initiatives and the macro economic backdrop. David will also address the firm's commitment to diversity and discuss our return to office strategy. Stephen will then discuss the recent stress test and our second quarter results in greater detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon Thanks, Heather, and thank you, everyone for joining this call this morning. I would like to start by saying that all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and your family remain safe and healthy during this unprecedented global health crisis. Let me begin on Page one of the presentation to review our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $13.3 billion up 41% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise was evident this quarter as we delivered solid net earnings of $2.4 billion, earnings per share of $6.26, and a return on equity of 11.1% and return on tangible equity of 11.8%. Our results in the quarter were strong, even while incurring higher credit provisions and litigation expenses, both of which impacted our returns. Our second quarter results contributed to solid first half 2020 revenues of $22 billion net earnings of $3.6 billion, and an ROE of 8.4% and ROTE of 9%. Litigation cost burdened our first half returns by approximately 280 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and was driven by significant new issue volumes and the counter cyclical performance of our market making activities. We maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor of choice for investment banking clients and our strong lead table positions across underwriting markets, with extraordinary volumes and both debt and equity enabling us to pick up market share. We delivered exceptional performance in FICC and equities on high levels of client activity, to point our risk intermediation expertise in our balance sheet on behalf of clients in a volatile market. We continue to provide high-quality advice to our wealth management clients and generated another quarter of solid consumer deposit growth. In asset management we recognize gains from market appreciation and our public investments; continue to harvest private equity positions and experience the partial recovery in our credit portfolio from the first quarter. Importantly, we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with an improving capital position and then high levels of market volatility and economic stress. Turning to the operating environment on Page two. We are navigating uncertain macroeconomic backdrop brought on by an extraordinary global health crisis. During the second quarter, we experienced both positive and negative forces, reflecting the near term economic challenges related to recent business shutdowns, counterbalanced by continued support from central banks and governments and market optimism as certain economies began to reopen. However, as we speak today, the past three opening in many U.S. states and corresponding economic consequences remain unclear. Since our April earnings call, our economists estimates for 2020 U.S. GDP improved from expected contraction in 2020 of 6.2% to 4.6% today, driven by expectations of a faster rebound from a deeper trough. That says on a global basis, growth expectations for 2020 deteriorated from an expected 2.5% decline in April to a 3.4% contraction expected today with the second quarter, reflecting a deeper decline in activity than expected three months ago. The prospect for a steeper recovery in the second half is in no small part due to the forceful and rapid action by governments central banks and governments by global central banks and governments, which are providing exceptional levels of liquidity and ongoing fiscal stimulus. These actions have been key to market resilience, tempering the economic impact of the virus. In the United States, we are seeing early indications of economic improvement, including the better than expected 18% rebound in retail sales and notable improvement in unemployment June to approximately 11% for more elevated numbers in May. As markets assess the impact of the virus in the second quarter and its potential economic consequence, we experienced the rise in the valuation of risk assets. During the second quarter the S&P 500 rallied by 20%, marking its best quarter since 1998. While broader global equity markets rose a similar amount, investment credit spreads tightened by over 80 basis points and high yield spreads tightened by roughly 140 basis points this quarter. In the context of these moves in financial assets, strong levels of client engagement during the second quarter demonstrate the breadth and the strength of our franchise. As we go forward as risk managers, we continue to prepare for the prolonged economic challenges and look beyond market valuations in our overall assessment of risk. We maintain a strong financial profile and we remain agile with our balance sheet as we continue to serve our clients. Pivoting for a moment, I am pleased to note that volatility in the first half of 2020 did not hinder our progress on most of our key growth initiatives. On June 16, we officially launched our transaction banking service to U.S. clients on-time and below budget despite the unexpected challenges of shifting our global team to work from home and launching the platform remotely. As of quarter end, we have over 175 clients on the platform and $25 billion in deposits, many of which we expect will become operational as clients begin to utilize -- begin their utilization of the platform over time. Second, in alternatives, we accelerated the marketing of a new credit fund called West Street Strategic Solutions as a part of our transition to fund driven investing. Client receptivity has been very strong. We believe the strategy is well-timed to capture opportunities in the market today and provide critical private financing to companies in need. Our approaches highly differentiated, leveraging the broad global sourcing capabilities of Goldman Sachs. Just this week, we have closed over $6 billion of commitments. Ultimately, we expect to raise an excess of $10 billion in the coming months. What is most impressive is that our first close occurred in less than 90 days entirely via virtual meetings. We're broadening our client base to include leading institutions and pension fund investors that have not partnered with Goldman Sachs before. These expanding relationships will be helpful to our efforts as additional strategies when funds are launched. You will recall that this initiative was part of our strategy discussed in Investor Day in January and promises to be significant in our move toward a less capital intensive, more fee driven model for our investing platforms. Third, in wealth management, we continued to integrate our new high net worth business, which we recently rebranded personal financial management. Year-to-date, we've generated over 400 client referrals between personal financial management and our flagship ultra high net worth private wealth business, representing $1.5 billion in assets under supervision opportunity, as we now have a credible offering to serve high net worth clients. That said establishing new health management relationships in the current environment with only virtual communication is challenging, we would expect our progress to accelerate under more normal circumstances. Fourth, we continued to expand our digital consumer business. We were pleased to announce our new small business lending partnership with Amazon, which will allow us to leverage our proprietary digital underwriting decision platform using data shared by Amazon third-party sellers to provide inventory and operational financing to support their growth. This partnership, which is being launched on a smaller scale at this moment is another example of our innovation and our ability to partner with leading corporations to deliver differentiated value to our customers. Our consumer partnership also included a recent point of sale financing engagement with JetBlue, and of course, our credit card with Apple. Before turning to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on diversity and inclusion which is a critical priority for the firm and a personal focus of mine for many years. Like so many others over the past six weeks, I've spent a lot of time listening and learning about the challenges we face as a nation on racial equity. While Goldman Sachs has long sought to advance diversity and inclusion, we're still not where we need to be. There's both a moral and economic imperative that we make progress. We must be a diverse and inclusive organization to unlock our full potential, as we serve a global marketplace that is diverse in all aspects including race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Lastly, let me review our business resiliency and return to office strategy, which has begun in our major offices globally. The firm continues to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely, demonstrating the dedication of our people, the strength of our technology and our business resiliency. Our firm has always had a team oriented apprenticeship culture and we benefit from being and working together, so as each of the communities where we operate reopens, we are taking the necessary steps to gradually return to office in a safe manner. We are following the lead of our Asia colleagues. We're in Hong Kong using a split team approach with up to 50% working from the office. We're also making progress in Europe, we're on the continent 35% returned and in the U.K., where approximately 15% of our employees are back in office. Recently in New York, a small group of employees have returned to office. Going forward, our progress will be dictated by circumstances in each region and we will adjust as needed. We are taking many new precautions to ensure safety including through masks and social distancing. And it's certainly not business as usual, but we're making tangible forward progress. As we take these steps, we will continue to keep the health and safety of our people as our top priority. In closing, I would just like to say how proud I am of the people of Goldman Sachs. They have worked tirelessly during this time to engage and serve our clients, leverage technology to insert our resiliency and prudently manage our risk and financial resources. With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page three. During the second quarter, we saw a very strong performance from our investment banking and global market segments, as clients were exceptionally active in raising capital in the equity and debt markets, managing balance sheets, repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes. We also saw a year-over-year revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we continue to expand our private wealth, high net worth and consumer businesses. Gains across these three segments were partly offset by a decline in our asset management segment, given smaller gains on equity investments versus a year ago. Before turning to segment results, I want to spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. On June 29, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.7%, which implies a common equity Tier-1 requirement of 13.7% for the firm, effective October 1. While higher than anticipated, this requirement is just slightly higher than our reported standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% as of June 30. In fact, our currency CET1 ratio improved by 110 basis points this quarter and is now 30 basis points higher than where we started this year, demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our capital while deploying balance sheet for our clients. Consistent with the Federal Reserve's requirements for all large banks, we will extend the suspension of purchases into the third quarter. But it is our intention to maintain our dividends both common and preferred, while complying with the SCB rule upon implementation. Furthermore, we will continue to pursue our longstanding practice of deploying capital to our business will return to accretive and otherwise returning it to our shareholders as permissible and ever mindful of the environment. As we consider the results of the stress test, it is important to bear in mind that the firm like the industry experienced an actual stress test over the past few months. The global economy contracted sharply and unemployment in the U.S. hit levels higher than contemplated in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. During this period, we maintained robust levels of liquidity and capital. And despite the stress, the firm emerged from the second quarter stronger and continues to serve clients from a position of financial and competitive strength and with the objective of producing attractive returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis, but we recognize our near term capital requirement is higher in light of the stress test results. We do not control the Federal Reserve's scenarios and models. But the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing the strategy outlined at Investor Day with a focus on diversifying our business mix and reducing the stress capital intensity of our balance sheet. As David highlighted, our execution of this strategy is advancing. We have sold or announced the sale of nearly $4 billion in equity investments year-to-date, including or agreed sell of Global Atlantic just last week, which will have positive implications for capital and balance sheet. We remain committed to capital efficiency as we diversify our business and grow more durable revenues. With that, let's now turn to our business performance on Page four, beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $2.7 billion up 36% versus a year ago, financial advisory revenues of $686 million remained healthy, but down 11% versus last year, amid fewer transaction closings consistent with the industry. Year-to-date, we participated in nearly $290 billion of announced transactions and closed over 140 deals for $600 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A, league table rankings by a considerable margin. While recent M&A announcements have slowed, our Investment Banking client dialogues remained very active with client interactions up over 30% versus last year, notwithstanding the continuing work from home dynamic. In the second half, we are watching for a potential pickup in M&A activity, both from companies coming from a position of strength, as well as those challenged by the environment. Dislocated asset prices will help drive those opportunities as will the significant amount of private capital available for deployment. That said macro and political uncertainty remain relevant and will influence outcomes. As M&A announcements declined in the quarter, the headline for investment banking was in underwriting. In these turbulent markets, we have seen our underwriting market shares increase as clients have turned to Goldman Sachs, particularly for more complex and innovative financings where execution matters. In equity underwriting, we delivered record quarterly net revenues of $1.1 billion, year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting, as our volumes jumped to over $50 billion across more than 270 deals. We saw strong activity this quarter across IPOs, follow-ons and private issuances. Convertibles also had record activity, where we ranked number one. In debt underwriting net revenues were $990 million up 93% from a year ago, as we help finance record U.S. investment grade volumes and supported a broader reopening of the high yield market. Since the crisis hit, our market shares in investment grade and high yield have increased globally, driving our number four ranking in global debt underwriting. This performance amidst the volatility of the last several months is the product of many years of strategic focus and investment in our client franchise. Given the pace of activity, our investment banking backlog decreased significantly versus the first quarter. This is a function of both the volume of our recent deal execution and slower replenishment. It is also important to point out that the timeline from discussion to execution, notably in financing has shortened in this period, and therefore, backlog may for the moment be an incomplete indicator of forward activity. Revenues from corporate lending were negative $76 million reflecting $200 million of hedge losses. For risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger relationship lending commitments. As credit spreads tightened during the quarter, we reverse much of the $375 million hedge gain we saw last quarter. With respect to relationship lending, we also saw a meaningful reversal of corporate commitment draws in the quarter totaling $9 billion in net pay downs as financing conditions improved and we help clients access the capital markets. The strong issuance market also enabled us to reduce our underwriting commitments in the deals book. For example, we successfully syndicated acquisition financings, including \u20ac10 billion for [indiscernible] and $27 billion for T-Mobile, thereby reducing exposure to the firm. Moving to global markets on Page five, where we experience considerable strength and performance. Net revenues were $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity, continued wider bid ask spreads and strong risk management amid continued market volatility. The business benefited from expanded market share as investment in the client franchise and our continued strategic commitment to a global business model with scale across asset classes bolstered performance. Turning to FICC on Page six. Net revenues were $4.2 billion, growth versus last year was driven by 163% increase in intermediation and 71% increase in financing revenues. In FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows with all five of our businesses increasing versus last year. In credit, our performance benefited from broad based client engagement and strength across investment grade, high yield and distressed as well as bank loans amid wider bid ask margins, tighter credit spreads and high new issue volume. We also saw continued success in systematic and electronic market making including high utilization rates for a bond pricing engine and automated trading, all leading to higher market share for the business. In currencies, we had another very active quarter with solid activity among corporates, banks and hedge fund clients. Revenues improved as higher volatility through a significantly higher client volume in the Americas and Europe. Our rates franchise also performed well on strong trading and high levels of client activity is elevated volatility, normalized amid coordinated global central bank stimulus. In commodities, strong trading performance was aided by high volumes and volatility across all of our businesses, including oil, natural gas and metals. In mortgages, net revenues improved significantly on strength in agency and non-agency trading, partly offset by lower loan trading volumes. Lastly, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength across repo and structured credit. Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.9 billion up 46% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $2.2 billion rose 91% aided by robust performance in cash and derivatives amid elevated client volumes. We saw strength across the board in commissions, market making, electronic trading and ETFs, as we executed for a broad base of active, passive hedge fund and systematic clients. This reflects our multi-year efforts to leverage our scale and expand wallet share. Equity financing revenues of $742 million declined 14% year-over-year, driven by tighter spreads, lower average client balances and weakness in Europe given recent dividend cancellations. Finally, across global markets, we continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance user experience and straight through processing. We also saw continued high levels of client activity on our marquee platform through the second quarter with our highest ever external engagement in April. Moving to Asset Management now on Page seven, in the second quarter, we generated segment revenues of $2.1 billion down 18% versus a year ago. As a reminder, this segment includes our platform that serves clients across a full spectrum of asset classes, from liquidity to alternatives, as well as our own on balance sheet investing activities. As David mentioned, we expect third-party investing in this segment to grow over time as part of our broader strategic initiatives. Management and other fees related to Asset Management clients totaled $684 million up 3% versus a year ago, driven by higher assets under supervision, offset by mix given growth in liquidity products. Equity investments produced $924 million of net gains in the second quarter, aided by asset sales and a significant rebound in the value of public equity positions. More specifically on our $2.6 billion public equity portfolio, we recognize $635 million of gains, including approximately 200 million in gains on Avantor and Sprout and significantly better performance across the broader portfolio. Despite recent gains, we reduced the size of our public portfolio by roughly 35% over the past five years. On our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated event driven gains of approximately $500 million from various positions, including the sale of our U.K. student housing investment and AirTrunk an Australian data center, both of which we announced last quarter. These gains were offset by $415 million of negative marks relating to certain COVID impacted and other investments. This quarter approximate 20% of companies in our private equity portfolio saw their performance impacted by COVID-19. Lastly, we also had positive revenues of $200 million related to our consolidated investment entities in the private equity portfolio. Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $459 million, which include approximately $200 million from net interest income, with the remainder from gains on fair value debt securities and loans, reflecting tighter credit spreads, retracing nearly 25% of the losses taken last quarter. Let me now turn to Page eight, where we provide further transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet. On the left of this slide, we show our equity investment portfolio broken out by sector, geography and vintage. We also provide new detail on our $20 billion portfolio of CIEs. These are primarily comprised of real estate investments of which $11 billion are finance predominantly by non-recourse debt. At the bottom of the slide, we show the diversification of the portfolio with only 7% related to the retail sector and 4% to hospitality. On the right side of the slide, we reflect our $30 billion lending and debt investment portfolio, which includes $17 billion of loans that are predominantly secured and 13 billion of debt investments. We further break down these amounts by accounting classification, sector and geography. This portfolio comprises corporate and real estate loans and corporate debt securities. We will continue to refine this disclosure to be responsive to questions from the investor community. I will now turn to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page nine. In this segment, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the second quarter, up 9% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management assets and higher consumer banking revenues. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $938 million rose 13% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition, assets under supervision rose 14% versus the prior year to $558 billion. Consumer banking revenues were $258 million in the second quarter, rising 19% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from credit card lending. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $92 billion across the U.S. and U.K., reflecting $20 billion of growth in the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at roughly $7 billion, of which approximately $5 billion were from Marcus loans and $2 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. Now let's turn to Page 10, for our firm wide assets under supervision. Total client assets increased to $2.1 trillion, approximately $240 billion versus the first quarter and up nearly $400 billion versus a year ago. This marks the first quarter in which we exceeded $2 trillion in assets under supervision. Our sequential improvement was driven by $100 billion of market appreciation $133 billion of liquidity inflows and $6 billion of long-term inflows. On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm wide net interest income was $944 million for the second quarter, down sequentially and versus a year ago, amid lower rates and an increase in our liquidity pool. Importantly, and as I have noted previously, as a firm, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. While our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive, given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets, and hedge floating rate liabilities, if interest rates remain stable, we expect NII to gradually expand over time as our consumer deposits reprice. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $117 billion, down $11 billion sequentially, as we saw significant pay downs on corporate revolvers as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, up $650 million versus last quarter. Let me break this provision number down for you. On the wholesale portfolio, we took pool reserves of $700 million, as modeled losses under CECL were higher relative to the first quarter, principally as a function of macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, worsening in the second quarter relative to similar inputs during the first quarter. The $700 million included both higher loss expectations and lower recovery rates. We also took impairments on wholesale loans of $540 million primarily related to credits in the industrials, TMT and natural resource sectors. Included in the $540 million of impairments, was $155 million related to Hertz as the company declared bankruptcy. This impairment was the largest in the quarter and was offset by gains on hedges which served as a risk mitigant. With hedged gains reported in the lending sub-segment of investment banking. In our consumer portfolio, provisions of $305 million increased versus last quarter, reflecting $220 million of reserve build an $85 million of net charge offs. During the quarter we recognized firm wide net charge offs of $260 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans increased 120 basis points to 3.7% for our $105 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 17%. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $8.4 billion increased versus last year. This includes higher compensation expense in line with revenue growth. Our non-comp expense growth was driven by $120 million increase in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees from higher client activity, $130 million of investments related to technology and new businesses including Apple Card and PFM and $100 million in CIE expense, which should decline as we harvest these investments, and roughly $900 million increase in litigation. Our reported year-to-date efficiency ratio was 67%, which was burdened by over 5 percentage points due to litigation. We continue to make progress on our medium term, expense savings initiatives set forth at Investor Day and expect to realize additional planned reductions in non-compensation expenses through the back half of the year. Finally, our reported tax rate was 22% for the year-to-date, reflecting the impact of higher earnings on permanent tax benefits and non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, as I mentioned common Tier-1 equity ratio for the firm was 13.6% at the end of the second quarter, under the standardized approach, up 110 basis points sequentially more than recouping the decline seen in the first quarter. The improvement was driven largely by earnings and RWA management. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 10 basis points to 12.4% as higher capital was partially offset by higher RWAs due to a full quarter impact of increased market volatility. On the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion up 5% versus last quarter. We maintain strong liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging a record $290 billion, with growth largely commensurate with balance sheet expansion amid strong deposit growth. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $268 billion, up $48 billion versus last quarter, which should enable us to maintain low levels of wholesale financing activity for the balance of the year has had been our intention. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise and our ability to provide differentiated [advice] [ph] and market access in a volatile environment. We maintain a prudent risk orientation, mindful of continued uncertainty in the markets and the ongoing health crisis. Our core businesses are performing well and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which set the foundation for our ability to serve our clients through this challenging time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : So my question on trading is, towards the beginning you said at Investor Day we were talking about little more focused on the financing side and felt like clients would pay for that and the intermediation has been more commoditized and volatility was low. So what do you know intermediation hikes because the world goes crazy? So I'm curious of two things on this front is, one is the pickup in intermediation just a function of volatility and that'll subside as the world calms down, has anything changed there in terms of pricing market share and the client's needs for you that's Part A. And Part B is on the financing front, he did show progress it is growing but is there anything in the way the [indiscernible] stress testing goes that would frown upon that or would change your intention on continuing to grow the financing side? David Solomon : Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. David. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start at a high level on trading activity and I'll have Stephen answer the second point around financing and addressing your question as to potential impact from CCAR. There's no question that when we step back and we think strategically about our franchise, we want to be in a position to serve our clients. We've always had great confidence in the broad global footprint that we bring to global markets, that we're an all products all over the world. And as our clients look to intermediate markets, we have a full service capability to serve them. There's no question that over the last decade, in a period of very low interest rates and low volatility that has been a more commoditized service, as you say, in a period where there's enormous change and enormous volatility in markets, we became super busy because our clients are super busy. And the reason you see this pick up in activity is because there was a lot of activity from our clients. I don't necessarily view that as permanent. But at the same point, it shows you that whether it's in a more low muted environment where we're well positioned to grow our financing business to serve our clients needs, or in a period where our clients be more access to liquidity, our franchise is very well positioned to serve them. And I think we got a benefit in this quarter from that positioning. It's obviously very hard to predict, given the uncertain nature of the environment, how this would continue, I'd say up front, because I know it'll be a question from a number of you that the activity levels that we saw at the end of March and in April, we're really extraordinary. We've not seen the same level of activity over the course of the last five or six weeks, since the beginning of June, but I would say the activity levels over the last five or six weeks when looked at compared to activity levels in 2019, or 2018 still look pretty active. And so we continue to see clients very, very engaged in our markets business. I think Stephen should comment on financing CCAR and how we're thinking about that. So I'll pass to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thanks, David, and thanks, Glenn, for the question. Just to sort of pivot off of David's comments, I would say the important thing to think about in the context of activity is that we were experiencing, as David put it, very elevated volumes at wider bid offer. And Goldman Sachs sort of went through the market and didn't pull back and away from the market. And in doing that, we picked up market share, which I think will have lasting effect, notwithstanding where the market goes in terms of its dynamic. And the other thing I would point out is that in working through those flows, we managed risk really well, meaning we were not with elevated inventory, we saw high velocity turn in our risk in serving the intermediation needs of the clients and I think that's an important point to make. On the financing side of the business overall, it's important to bear in mind financing and FICC was up about 71%. We saw considerable strength both in repo and in structured credit. We saw similar activity on the equity financing side as well. As it relates to SCB and CCAR, I think that the ability of the firm to be agile and take our capital ratio up to 13.6% kind of takes SCB off the table and capital off the table in terms of our ability to present ourselves into the third quarter and beyond is ready and open to play the role we did in the second quarter, which is stand ready to meet the intermediation and trading needs of our clients. And I think the final comment, I'd make just on capital is that, we said during Investor Day that we would be agile, meaning we would be agile with the deployment of capital in and around the businesses of the firm. Now, at the time, the questions that came to us were more about the ability to pull capital from the securities business not put to it, in this quarter, we moved capital to it, returns were extraordinary, super attractive and we were able to move that around, you know, as the kind of flexible organization that we'd like to think of ourselves as and we'll continue to do that based on what the market opportunity shows us. Glenn Schorr : Very helpful and thank you for that one. One other question is, you mentioned the sale of Global Atlantic. I think that closes in a few quarters. I think you guys should get a lot of respect for growing that from scratch basically. Just curious how much of that, what percentage you own, Goldman Sachs own, not the private client, Goldman Sachs own sizing of the game, how much RWA that frees up anything you could help on that? Because it is a good business, it's just really dense RWA I guess? Stephen Scherr : No, I mean, Glenn, I think you characterized it exactly well, and you hit the point, which was our motivation for the sale itself, which is, this was a business that began in 2004. It was spun-off in the second quarter of '13. And over time, because of its intensity as a financial institution, it becomes more capital intensive. So, obviously, our motivation is to free up that capital and deploy it elsewhere around. We were about 25% of the ownership we're selling out, if not all, then, the preponderance of our position on that sale will release about $2.2 billion of risk weighted assets and about $400 million of attributed equity. I'd also point out that this is part and parcel of kind of a larger move that will take place over the course of the entire year, which is this will be part of about $4 billion of sales, off the balance sheet, all part of our broader strategy of looking at lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet, intense investments and moving more towards third-party funds. And so we will by the end of the year, reduce that down by about $4 billion. That will relieve us of about $2 billion of capital and about $13 billion of risk weighted assets, again, Global Atlantic being part of that. I would say roughly speaking, almost half of that is done, with the other half announced and spoken for and expected through the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Christian, please go ahead and check your phone to see if it's on mute. Christian Bolu : Maybe just following up on the capital question just asked. I guess I think about your CET1, potential for another 50 basis points of GCP surcharge. Maybe you might want in as a management buffer on top of what will be a minimum SCB number, your actual capital requirements could be approaching 15% on the standardized side. So maybe just help us think about how you think about getting that number back down to -- more like 13%, 13.5%, which is a long-term target. And then sort of, what are the strategic or what are the implications for sort of your strategic growth initiatives potentially you have to bring down capital by that much? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Thanks, Christian. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we remain committed over the medium term to the range of 13% to 13.5%. I think we're executing at the moment in the moment, meaning we're in the midst of a pandemic. Obviously, the results around CCAR and the SCB fixing was higher than what we had expected and perhaps reflects a view about where we are at a moment in the market. But I think our strategy as articulated and Investor Day and frankly speaking what I described in the path toward reducing down capital intensity of our balance sheet investing are all part and parcel of our ability to take down, what is otherwise meant to be represented in the peak to trough in the SCB. And so we're executing now, we are in a position having grown back our capital ratio to be within narrow distance of what's required. But again, that's a moment, I wouldn't fix a permanent capital buffer, nor look to amend what I view is our medium to long-term objective for a profile of the business, which will benefit from key strategic initiatives, which will lower the capital intensity of where we're going. And I think that's the forward path. And so, we'll remain quick on our feet as it relates to this. But I just want to give you a sense of what the forward direction is for the firm itself. Christian Bolu : Great, thank you. And then on cost, a very strong core cost control ex-litigation in the quarter, I believe you mentioned, you'd expect more non-comp benefit in the back half. So maybe help quantify that for us? And then, maybe look longer term, you've had a bit of a chance now to get a sense of the post COVID world. So how do you think about sort of structural expense trajectory, particularly in light of that sort of 1.3 billion target, can how much upside could that be in that number? Thank you. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Sure. So a non-comp expense is, as you suggest ex-litigation, our non-comp expenses are up about 9%. And a good portion of that increase is attributable to variable expense like BC&A. So this is expense, obviously related to the nature and level of activity that we experienced in the business. And the other portion of that increase is largely related to new businesses or larger size businesses than where we were a year ago. So think, the acquisition of United Capital expenses associated with it, or Apple Card. And so expense control has been on the front of our mind. What I expect to play out in the back half of the year, we'll be as we've said previously, the benefits from a reduction in double occupancy expense relating to real estate, two buildings, both in London and in Bangalore that roll off and so as we've long planned and expected, that will benefit us in terms of the reduction in non-comp expense overall. On a more structural plane and thinking back to the $1.3 billion of expense reduction that we articulated, frankly, I think we come at that number now, with greater confidence in the in that number and frankly the ability to exceed it over the medium to long-term. And part of that is informed by judgments that we are making and analysis that we're undergoing, not just simply about the size of the firm, but where the physical location of the firm can be. That is our ability to take aggregation of people or whole businesses and look to move them to different locations either around the world or around the country. And I think the flexibility and the agility that we can take from what we've witnessed in the context of the last several months, only feeds our confidence in the ability to do that and therefore our ability to hit the $1.3 billion target or better over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Wanted to ask just a follow-up on the funding optimization efforts that you guys have talked about before. Certainly the deposit growth continues to surprise positively both on the consumer side as well as within transaction banking. Now given that some of the growth appears to be tracking ahead of plan, or it sounds like you're quite confident on your expense savings targets from Investor Day. I was hoping you can give us an update on the funding side as well whether you're still quite confident in that billion savings goal, recognizing that a lot is going to be dependent on term structure shape of the curve, what have you. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So on deposits, your observation is right. I mean total deposits for the firm now is $268 billion that's up $48 billion quarter-on-quarter. Marcus deposits now, again, through the retail channel are at $92 billion that was up $20 billion in the second quarter. And we're also seeing deposits commence or not yet operational in the transaction banking deposit side. So the growth in the deposit channels overall has been really, really positive. The question of whether we can harvest the precise level of savings of $1 billion that we forecast, rests largely on market sort of developments. What I mean by that is, the deposits in retail currently are from a financial point of view, less valuable in the moment than where they were in the January Investor Day, meaning we've seen Fed funds come down by about 150 basis points but we haven't experienced corresponding beta on the downside in the retail deposit channel. That will come over time as we develop a more sort of substantive and profound level of engagement with retail customers, the reliance on rate will become less so and we'll be able to sort of capture back where we were. But I'd say that much of what we premised our Investor Day presentation on was an assumption about normal markets were not normal markets, the precipitous decline in rates but not a corresponding decline in deposits will lessen some of the savings but I wouldn't sort of put too much of a permanent conclusion to that, let's wait until we get to a more permanent state of a normal market to sort of judge that. By the way, by contrast, we do see positive beta in other channels which play that way, particularly in the high net worth channel. But I think we'll need to sort of assess just the magnitude. By the way, none of that is to take away from the strategic value of this consumer and the overall deposit channel, which is enabling us, frankly, faster than we thought to take out the wholesale funding channel. And just by way of reference, we've got about $10 billion of wholesale debt through the balance of this year, either maturing or subject to call and we'll be able to sort of act on that reducing down the liquidity that we hold all as a consequence of the growth that we've seen in the deposit channel overall. Steven Chubak : Great. Thanks for that helpful color Stephen. Maybe this is a question for you, David on the M&A outlook. And one of the concerns we heard from folks is the challenging M&A backdrop could very well persist just given low levels of CEO confidence and just uncertainty around the election and future tax policy. And I was hoping you can give some color as to what you're hearing from the C-suite, regarding appetite for M&A and willingness to do deals and maybe what ingredients needs to be in place to help reinvigorate deal activity here. David Solomon : Thanks for that question. And of course, you're right at a high level. And we've always said this, the number one thing that drives M&A activity is CEO confidence. And there's no question in this environment given the high level of uncertainty, it's much harder to see those same levels of confidence as a result of that as we highlighted in our opening commentary that M&A volume -- M&A announced M&A transactions in the second quarter were down 75%. And so as you would expect, we saw withdrawal of activity. We obviously saw closings on previous activity. But we did not see replenishment in advisory transactions that we would normally see. And I'd say that in March and April, in particular and into the first half of May, dialogue with CEOs around forward strategic decision-making was very, very limited. People were in crisis mode and we're very focused on dealing with the immediacy of the healthcare crisis and the crisis as it was affecting their businesses. We have seen over the course of the last six weeks or so as economies around the world have started to reopen, or reengagement by clients and CEOs in their forward strategic view. I would say that the dialogue levels right now are particularly robust. I don't believe that we'll see short-term activity but I would expect over the course of the next 2 to 4 quarters, those activity levels will build, as we have a clear understanding as to the overall direction of the healthcare issue that we all face, and the overall economic impact that comes out of this. And as people have more confidence, they'll be able to move forward, you did see one or two significant M&A transactions during the course of the last week. I want to be clear, it's not shut down, but I think you need a more certain environment with better insight into the healthcare situation and the economic situation to see that replenishment normalized. My guess is, we'll get that but it'll take a couple of quarters for sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : First one, just on the private equity sales this year, I think you mentioned freeing up about 2 billion of capital. And if I'm not mistaken, I think during the Investor Day, you guys mentioned I think it was about 4 billion over a period of three years. So just curious, is this more accelerated has that opportunity set, expanded? Just trying to get an understanding of maybe the pace of that kind of strategic shift? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, you have the facts, right. I mean by the end of the year, as I said, will free up about $2 billion, which is 50% of the way toward the objective of four. I would say that, I don't view that four as being in any way, the limit of what we can get done, the more we can advance and increase the cadence on the migration to low our capital density investing, the better will be and we'll continue to pursue that. Obviously, there's two sides to this that are both progressing. I mean, on one hand, we're effectuating sales that will relieve us of capital, but we're doing that not leaving ourselves in kind of a canyon of activity in that as we said during the prepared remarks, we've really advanced on the raise of our first fund inside of 30 days, having a first close in excess of 6 billion with a target of greater than 10. And while we set out the objective of doing about $100 billion of raise in and across a range of different funds, I think we all have an expectation that will exceed the $20 billion target we thought we would get to this year and look to revise targets across all of this as in when we think it appropriate. But, this is good forward progress and we're very determined to see it happen. Mike Carrier : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up just on the trading activity. David, I think you mentioned just higher activity year-over-year even in the past couple of weeks. Just when you think about it across that products client side, obviously, we have ongoing volatility and uncertainty that kind of benefits the industry. But are you seeing any point it's a structural shifts in terms of Goldman share gains, more use of the electronic platforms, additional client relationships that can maybe be more sustainable once some of this volatility surfaces. David Solomon : I appreciate the question, Michael. There number of things going on that we've highlighted, but to summarize or maybe put it in a different context of frames to your question. One of the things we've done over the last two years is we've thought very, very carefully about our global markets franchise, the way we wanted to center that franchise, which was really around our clients. And we invested in a one GF approach that we've talked about, that really tries to improve the client experience for our clients across that franchise. And we started making an investment in those relationships, improving wallet gaps, improving shares. That's an investment we started two years ago, that was paying dividends. But I think what you saw, given the increased volatility and the heightened activity on the part of our clients, we saw an acceleration of the benefits of some of that investment during the course of the end of the first quarter and the second quarter. I think the real share gains there. I'm getting a lot of feedback from clients directly, that they really appreciate the way we've invested in the client centricity of that business, the way we've kept a strong investment and really meeting their needs. And I think we've reaped some dividends from that investment. Now, as that continues, we'll work to protect those share gains. But I'd also highlight, I still think there's upside for us when I look across the hundred largest players in that business and I look at our share across the hundred largest players and we're top three with 100 largest players. While we've made progress, I think we still have upside in the medium term if we continue to execute on our strategy to take more wallet share, given the strength and the breadth of our franchise and we're going to continue to remain focused on that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy, please go ahead and check to see if you're on mute. Betsy Graseck : So, just a couple of questions. One, I know that earlier, there was a question around capital and how to utilize capital most efficiently. And I wanted to raise it how I'm seeing the VAR trajectory over this past quarter. And I'm wondering, is there an opportunity here given the capital generation that you've been unable to do and also the RWA, compression that we lean into the VAR and keep VAR relatively high. I know in the quarter it was up significantly q-on-q. But how much of that is market related? And how much do you anticipate running it maybe a higher VAR than you have had in the past given, your capital flexibility that you have. Stephen Scherr : So, I think the premise of your question Betsy sort of strikes at the answer, which is, we do have capital flexibility to elevate our VAR using VAR as a basis or as a metric if you will, for extending into client needs. So, both responding to the need for intermediation and positions deploying capital against it, and equally being responsive to the possibility of the market inflating, such that VAR increases in the context of inflated notional positions with particular credits. And so I think we feel very comfortable and part of the reason to take up our capital to sort of adequate levels relative to where we will be required to be, I mean, gives us greater confidence to see VAR inflate to the extent that we are in a position to serve our clients in periods of continued uncertainty as David's been speaking about in the markets more broadly. Betsy Graseck : Was there anything this quarter in particular, that's [row] [ph] VAR, I guess last quarter was A1 average VAR and this quarter was 122 and I know that total one, but it was up across the board in the various categories. May speak to what you saw in this quarter that drove that VAR up and what you think could be sustained into the second half of the year and what that means for trading revenues. Jamie [indiscernible] I should cut in half your trading revenues, for 3Q but where do you stand on that kind of question? Stephen Scherr : Well, I don't think any of us are in a position to make such a declarative judgment about the exact direction of trading revenues in through the second half of the year. I think that, what we need to do is set ourselves up to be in the service of clients and avail ourselves of the benefit of our shareholders of the opportunities as they present. And I think David characterized it well, which is, the second half will be more characterized by uncertainty than any ability to forecast up or down in the market itself. And I think we're well positioned from a liquidity from a capital and from a risk point of view to be able to avail ourselves. The one thing I would say, as we think about risk in markets like this is drawing the distinction between, what's liquid and what's not. So when I look at the firm, I think that inventory was managed in the pursuit of intermediation in the trading business exceptionally well. We saw very high velocity as we've long been looking to work with our securities leadership to do, in terms of seeing quicker turnover in inventory in support of trading activity. When I look at illiquid, this is an area where from a risk point of view, we use market opportunities to lower for example, commitments made in the deals book and took that book down and took risk down and position ourselves now to take on more risk in through the second half of the year, to the extent that those opportunities present themselves. And so, I feel quite good and confident about where we stand from a risk position, not limited to what we do in trading activity, which will present itself but equally around other areas of the firm, with more structural and kind of less liquid risks to take on board. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, my short question is as, look, you're the number one advisor. So what are you advising clients to do? And how are you allocating the firm's resources to back that up? And the color behind that is, it seems like the elephant in the room is, look COVID cases are going up. I think death rates followed by about four weeks per -- expert that we had on a call and then you have shutdowns, you're seeing the shutdowns like in California and elsewhere. So there's two scenarios here. One is maybe Goldman is needed less that investors and your clients go home and sit on the sidelines, too much risk, or maybe Goldman Sachs needed more, as you said, more complex deals, wider bid offer spreads, elevated volumes, more of a freak out market where you guys stay open for business. So what are you advising clients? How are you reallocating your resources for that and what are your thoughts on my question? David Solomon : Well, it's a very uncertain environment, Mike. It's a very uncertain environment. And so one of the things we're advising clients is that it's a very uncertain environment and they have to bring caution and planning to everything they do. I watch TV and read the news like everyone else and sometimes quite surprised by how certain people are. I continue to be relatively uncertain as to the trajectory of all this. As I've said before, we need to understand the healthcare risks associated with the virus and get to a point where people feel safe and comfortable. Obviously, a vaccine would be a meaningful step forward with respect to that. While there is no question that there's progress with respect to a whole bunch of companies that are making significant investments in a vaccine. And there was positive news again this morning, the exact trajectory of that and how we deploy it and whether the work and the effectiveness of all that is still unclear and uncertain. I'm confident we will get through this but the timing and the impact is relatively uncertain. We've also because of the shutdowns economically all around the world have slowed economic activity. There's no question as reopening occurred, we've seen a pickup in that activity. But with an increase in viruses and this uncertainty persisting, I think you'll see a flattening on that economic pickup and that will slow the progress we make economically from here. So we continue to advise clients to be thoughtful and cautious about that, With respect to Goldman Sachs being open and ready and willing to serve our clients, there's no question in the second quarter that our clients were extremely active and we were there to support them. It's unclear how active we'll be in the third quarter, but there will be activity, we'll be open and at the end of the third quarter, we can kind of look back and say how that unfolded. But I think we've proven and will continue to prove with great humility, that we can be flexible, we can work remotely, we can adapt. And we can also help clients adapt. And so this is a very challenging time for everyone. The human toll of this crisis is really very significant. Everyone is focused on their employees, everyone's focused on their businesses and their stakeholders and the shareholders. And I think that people need to be cautious, because the economic repercussions of this will play out over the medium term. And this is not going to be in my opinion, a quick resolution. And we'll continue to try to be nimble and flexible and help our clients navigate what I think will continue to be a very uncertain period. Mike Mayo : As a follow up, just as it relates to capital markets, we're all trying to fill in our models for the next several quarters. What could be the next step in capital markets, in terms of repositioning of portfolios due to the election and another government stimulus or [indiscernible] continuing or you mentioned mergers, or you said volumes are still above the level last year even if coming down. People tend to give you a [PE of one] [ph] on your earnings, like a quarter such as this, whereas you talk about the annuity with your clients. So I'm just trying to figure out kind of what's the next step with capital markets at Goldman Sachs? David Solomon : Well, I think our capital markets, businesses have long been a leader. And we've been positioned as a very, very strong leader in M&A advisory activity and equity underwriting activity for decades we've made a significant investment over the last decade in our debt capital markets business. And I think over the last few years, you've seen the benefits of that investment. And I think we're very well positioned to help our clients meet their capital markets needs. Capital Markets is a volatile business yet through the cycle our capital markets, businesses produce significant activity and significant profitability. I don't have a crystal ball as to what's going to happen in the next six months. I've had some time discussions with people where people talk about some capital markets activity being pulled forward. And there's no question that some refinancing has been pulled forward. At the same point, there's been a whole bunch of activity that we could have never imagined would have occurred because of the virus and the economic consequences of the shutdown. So when you look at industries like airlines and cruise and travel and leisure, there's been an enormous amount of capital at markets activity that was completely unanticipated. And so as we look forward over the next six months, I think there'll be other things based on the macro environment that will either lead to a pickup in some places or a decrease. The one thing I know for sure is our franchise on a global basis is very well positioned to meet our clients' needs as that activity occurs. Stephen Scherr : Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that and this goes back to the initial question you asked which is what are we doing with our clients? I mean, you can look in the capital markets at, the need to apply more creativity to structured solutions for clients than perhaps what we've seen in kind of straightway issuance in more normalized markets. Look at the deal that was completed for United Airlines, which I think brings some interesting ingenuity and structure to what otherwise in the normal course, would have been a fairly straightway financing. And I think that's the nature and level of engagement with the clients that we're experiencing. And I think, it responds a bit to the question of where the capital markets going. There may be more of a need of that right in the uncertainty that David's been addressing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : This quarter, you guys made a purchase of Folio an RIA platform and just kind of curious if you can maybe give a little color on that, was that purely used by United Capital, or is there interest in providing third-party custody services in the RIA space, which is a market where we're seeing some consolidation and there's a lot there -- if they are going from three to two strong providers of pure custody. So just curious if that's part of the plan there? Stephen Scherr : Yes. I think the way to think about it is that, in the end we're looking to continue to build out kind of three components of that business, there's obviously our ultra high net worth business, there's a high net worth business PFM, which was the United Capital, I think Folio serves to clearly provide added heft to that component of what we're trying to build. The third leg in that stool would obviously be a more mass affluent consumer piece. But the acquisition of Folio was clearly aligned with the strategy begun under United Capital and the provision of third-party custody more broadly. So I think it fits both a generalized strategy, but equally it is entirely consistent with what we were trying to build out in the high net worth or PFM space, which was the United Capital asset itself. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you for that Steve. And then, when we were thinking about your comments on the M&A market, interesting and very helpful about the pickup and dialogue in the last six weeks and clearly there's a lot of uncertainty, as you flagged with healthcare and the economic trajectory, but we also hear about the election uncertainty holding back some component of activity in the U.S. Are you seeing a difference or a significant divergence in the level of dialogue in the United States versus other geographies? And is it the other geographies that's leading to the greater engagement or are you seeing it pick up in the U.S. as well just a nuance on that? David Solomon : Sure, Bren. And what I would say is I don't see a difference in engagement levels in the U.S. versus let's say the rest of the world. Engagement levels were way down, engagement levels are picking up everywhere. While the election is certainly something that I think will get a lot of attention over the next five months. It's still five months away and I think that the healthcare crisis and the economic crisis as a result of the healthcare crisis is at a much bigger impact on engagement levels than the election, as to how the election starts to impact decision-making. I can see it in some ways being an accelerant and in some ways, potentially creating uncertainty and slowing things down. But I don't think the election cycle is yet playing a big role in client engagement. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : So, just want to drill a little bit more into the progress in transaction banking. And really just trying to think about do the scaling in that business, 175 clients today and making some progress on deposits. I guess, where do you feel like you are in terms of market share with those clients? So are they kind of test driving the platform today, but they're still kind of a huge opportunity of maybe more penetration? And then, as you think about kind of scaling that platform, kind of what are they using today, why are they using Goldman Sachs and what's the opportunity to do more with him? David Solomon : Sure. I appreciate the question. And I know there's been a lot of interest in this. There's also been a lot of questions about our ability to execute on this. If you go back strategically, one of the reasons that we were very confident of building this platform is we were a big customer of other institutions. And we saw a need based through our own experience. And we've really put together what we think is a very, very friction free digital platform that advances the connectivity that clients have to their financial institution and ease of use in very, very meaningful ways. The rollout has gone very, very well. I think we've been very cautious and conservative, as we talked about it, particularly at Investor Day around client take up. I think one of the reasons we felt comfortable that we could build a platform and attract clients to it, if we build a good platform, is that we have relationships with all these clients whose relationships are real. They rely on us we lend to these clients. And if we had an offering that was competitive, we felt that was a reasonable ask of our clients to consider our offering. I think what you've seen in this initial rollout is a lot of clients have considered our offering and the first and easiest way to consider it is to leave deposits with us to onboard, get an account, see the ease of use and doing that and leave deposits with us. And so, I think that's accelerated at a much faster pace than we expected. We have had a handful of significant clients turn operational, which is obviously where the business becomes much more attractive to us. And I would expect over the course of the medium term, we will grow a very substantial business where these clients become operational on our platform. And that will lead to significant fee-based revenue streams that will help that business grow. But we're in the very early stages, our market share is tiny, we don't have enormous market share aspirations, but we will grow this business we believe nicely over the medium term and it will make a meaningful -- it will make a reasonable contribution to the overall diversification of Goldman Sachs. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. Appreciate that. And then just a follow up question just around the comp ratio, so year-to-date, accruals 35% versus 36% last year in the first half. So I'm trying to just kind of parse through how much of that is actually some of those expense savings coming through versus maybe leverage on mix or the fact that revenues are up 20%, or trying to think about the accrual and how you guys are thinking about that relative to where you were last year. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So the way we think about it is that each and every quarter, we've taken accrual as at that quarter as to what we forecast, we need to pay the organization and compensate the organization on a pay for performance basis. And it's not more than that there's no signaling that's embedded in it or otherwise. I think a good deal of the savings is not anticipated in the context of lowering our comp ratio. It's really looking at the balance of expenses that I was addressing to an earlier question in terms of what we can do to bring down some of the non-comp expense and overall bring our operating expenses down. But fixing this at 35%, as you may remember, we were at 33.8% last year, and so this is an ongoing quarter-by-quarter assessment of what we need to do taking a look at the overall performance of the business itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a question on the SCB and DFAST, just trying to, if we look at trading, as you pointed out and I agree, you've seen almost a counter cyclicality in trading revenues holding up very well in this kind of stress test we just had from COVID. Yet count, losses in trading through DFAST are still pretty high. So when we think about your SCB going forward, do you think there is any opportunities that have sort of the Fed sort of recalculating how they think about trading losses, which could be a benefit to you or is, simply the view to get the SCB sort of down is to just continue to do what you're doing over time and remix assets. Just trying to see if you think there's a potential for a little benefit from the performance over the last six months? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So I would say that for us pursuing both passive petition and action is right meaning there's a do it yourself proposition here, which is to drive what we've been talking about that is lower capital intensity, balance sheet investing, third-party funds and the like. All of that is subject to self help. And we are minded to aggressively address that, so as to bring the intensity down. As a related matter, I think as you would imagine, we have been very active in our engagement and discussions with the Fed about the very observation you're making, which is when we look back historically, at our own performance, volatility carries a positive correlation for trading revenue and it's not uncorrelated and we have a view about what that means in the context of what the downdraft would be and have been engaged in a very active dialogue with the Fed on that topic. How to handicap the outcome of that is an impossibility and so it is why not withstanding that petition we continue to engage in self-help and look to remedy this on our own terms. Jim Mitchell : Well, it's good to hear you're [least] [ph] asking. And just maybe one quick follow-up on the advanced CET1. Given the SCB is based on standardized, I mean is there any constraints, does it matter the advanced CET1, I hate to say it that way, but does it? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think the rating agencies appropriately take a look at the advanced and remember, this has the CVA component in it that's not represented in standardized. And so you've got to be mindful in managing all of these capital ratios that there's not one but many constituencies to bear in mind. And so we do that and obviously pay attention to all of these ratios in the context of how we carry ourselves. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KVW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just one real quick one on credit, is there anyway you guys give an update on kind of where you're at with regards to the frozen delinquencies? And then, also how you're thinking about reserve builds from here and I mean you build reserve a decent amount this quarter, is this the peak, or I guess, sufficiently reserved for go forward losses? Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So why don't I start on deferrals or forbearance, so, it's quite light across our whole portfolio, there's only about 3% of our total credit that is itself subject to forbearance. It's higher in the consumer portfolio, it's been about 10% of the total portfolio that has taken up forbearance, interestingly of those that do about 50% are current on their payments. But bear in mind, that's a very small component of the overall risk profile of the firm at $7 billion total. So overall, across the whole of it, it's about 3%. It's not significant in the context of how we operate and how we think about the risk overall, given how low it is. I would say as it relates to the consumer, it is one reason why the coverage ratio that we have through our reserve on a consumer portfolio is as high as it is at 17%. That's not at all a reflection of our current experience in terms of losses. Losses actually are trending lower, notwithstanding the moment in the market, but out of prudence and caution and given how young that portfolio is and given the fact that forbearance can match risk. We've taken up our provision there. More generally on your question about provisioning, as you know, we've took a provision of $1.6 billion in the quarter, the methodology we use is the same, we did in the first and we'll hold ourselves going forward, which is we look at macro economic indicators, including unemployment, that sort of correlate well to expectations around default rates, and then pull that through to avail ourselves of pool reserves. And we broke that down in the prepared remarks, which amounted to about $700 million of the 1.6 that's there, with the balance being impairments and the consumer component of provisions that I spoke about. It leaves us with a coverage ratio of about 3.7%, which I think is roughly in line with where the market is and accurately reflecting risk that's there. So what happens in the forward, it'll purely be a function of what plays out in the market and whether certain of these macro economic indicators worsen or improve from here and that obviously, will flow through our model and dictate the level of provisioning, we take. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. David Solomon : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does include the Goldman Sachs' second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded today, October 14, 2020.  Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.  Today I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start by reviewing third quarter and year-to-date performance. He will also provide an update on our client franchise, the macroeconomic backdrop, and our progress on returning to office. Stephen will then discuss our third quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks Heather, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019d like to start by saying that all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and family remain healthy amid the continuing challenges with COVID-19. Let me begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results.  In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.8 billion, up 30% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $3.6 billion, record quarterly earnings of $9.68 per share, and a return on equity of 17.5% and return on tangible equity of 18.6%. Our third quarter results contributed to strong year-to-date revenues of $33 billion and an ROE of 8%. Litigation costs burdened our year-to-date returns by over 500 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses in the first half.  The third quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We benefited from an improving market backdrop, high levels of client engagement, continued countercyclical performance in market making, and positive momentum across our strategic initiatives. We maintained our leading global position in M&A as announcements increased in the quarter from a relatively dormant period earlier in the year. We maintained strong lead [ph] table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity underwriting and a top three ranking in high yield, with both markets very active during the quarter. We again delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities on solid client activity across our global platform, reinforced by recent market share gains across asset classes in the first half of 2020. In asset management, we recognized strong gains from our public and private equity positions. We also generated strong investment performance and positive net interest income in our credit portfolio, and we continued to have success with our West Street Strategic Solutions Fund, where we\u2019re on track for $14 billion of total commitments. We are delivering our full spectrum of alternatives capabilities and have launched marketing on new funds in private equity, growth equity, and real estate. In wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra high net worth PWM clients. We also made progress integrating our new personal financial management business to provide our high net worth clients with a broader set of capabilities, and we\u2019ve been pleased to see synergies between both groups, which have resulted in 700 referrals this year, representing over $2.5 billion of an asset opportunity. In consumer, we continue to have success expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both directly and through partnerships. During the quarter, we launched Marcus Insights integrating Clarity Money\u2019s capabilities into the Marcus app to give consumers a more comprehensive view of their finances, and we continued to make progress building checking and investment capabilities, which will launch next year. On the partnership side, we launched seller financing with Wal-Mart and expanded on our June platform launch with Amazon. Additionally, our partnership with Apple continues to grow, and we look forward to leveraging our credit card platform for additional partnerships over time. Turning to the operating environment on Page 2, we continue to navigate an uncertain backdrop brought on by COVID-19, which has an unclear trajectory. From a macroeconomic perspective, the markets continue to benefit from the unprecedented monetary and fiscal support by central banks and governments globally. In the third quarter, the Federal Reserve announced its new approach to average inflation targeting and forecasted that short-term rates would remain locked near zero for the next several years. In that same vein, in the U.K. where the economy is expected to contract by over 9% this year, the Bank of England opened the door to negative rates as a potential policy tool.  Meanwhile, U.S. labor markets continue to show headline improvement with the unemployment rate declining to 7.9% in September, down nearly 50% from peak levels in April, reflecting approximately 13 million people out of work. That said, according to the latest job reports, those improvements were largely driven by reversals of temporary layoffs, while permanent job losses have risen to nearly 4 million people, reflecting some of the deeper challenges in our economy. Additionally, there continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the trajectory of the virus, which may impact the pace of the economic recovery as we head into the fall and winter. In particular, we see continued challenges in a number of impacted industries, including restaurants, hospitality, and oil and gas.  Despite these uncertainties, since our July earnings call our economists\u2019 expectations for 2020 U.S. GDP improved by 120 basis points to an expected contraction of 3.4%, while global growth estimates slipped 50 basis points to an expected 3.9% contraction. Looking into next year, estimates have strengthened with expected growth of nearly 6% in the U.S. and 7% globally.  In spite of the ongoing challenges, we are seeing higher global equity markets and tighter credit spreads, perhaps as a reflection of the speed of economic recovery. During the third quarter, the S&P 500 rallied by 8%, touching new highs in September and leaving the index up 4% for the year. This yearly gain, however, was concentrated in the top five tech companies, which rose 42%, while the remaining 495 names in the index declined by 2%.  Equity market volatility also remains elevated with the average VIX this quarter more than 60% higher than the third quarter a year ago, though well below levels seen in March and April. On the credit front, U.S. investment grade spreads tightened by roughly 20 basis points and high yield spreads tightened by almost 90 basis points during this quarter. As we go forward, we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weakness in the broader economy. Given the uncertain macro environment, we are focused on serving our clients to help them navigate this evolving backdrop. Before turning to Stephen, I\u2019d like to spend a moment on our approach to return to office. We have employed a number of new protocols to operate as safely as possible around the world. We do this as public and private healthcare organizations work tirelessly to develop therapies and vaccines, which I fully believe in time will allow all of us to return to a more normalized environment. We are focused on helping our people come back safely as being together enables greater collaboration, which is key to our culture. We continue to employ an adaptable approach which considers individual circumstances and local health recommendations to give our people the flexibility and the tools they need to return to the office safely.  We continue to make measured progress. In Hong Kong and Tokyo, we have around 60% of our people working from the office. In most of Europe, we\u2019re at around 50%, and in the U.K. we\u2019re at nearly 30%. In New York, we\u2019ve seen a gradual uptick since Labor Day with roughly 2,000 people working in office as of last week, and we currently have 30% of our people rotating through the New York office on a weekly basis. That said, we will continue to be nimble and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities in cities where we operate and are ready to shift gears if the evolving situation with COVID-19 warrants. Under all circumstances, we continue to keep the health and safety of our people as a top priority. In closing, I would like to thank the people of Goldman Sachs who have remained dedicated to serving our clients while managing the firm\u2019s risk, liquidity and capital to ensure our ongoing financial strength and operational resiliency. While 2020 has been a difficult year in many ways, I\u2019m incredibly pleased with the state of our client franchise and progress we\u2019ve made in executing on our strategic priorities, and I look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on our investor day goals at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the third quarter, the firm performed well across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, our corporate clients remained very active in raising debt and equity capital. We also saw an increase in strategic dialog following a more dormant period for M&A activity earlier in the year. In global markets, client engagement remained high as we gained share during the year and enabled clients to manage risks across asset classes. In asset management, strong growth was driven by higher management and other fees as well as gains from our long-term equity and credit investments following a more challenged first half of the year. We also saw double-digit revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we expand our service offering to individuals across the wealth spectrum. With those headlines, let me now turn to our specific business performance on Page 4, beginning with investment banking. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of nearly $2 billion, up 7% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $507 million declined 27% versus last year on fewer transaction closings in the quarter, reflecting the lower level of client activity in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, year to date we participated in over $630 billion of announced transactions and closed approximately 225 deals for $810 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A lead tables by a meaningful margin. Importantly, the pace of M&A announcements has picked up considerably in recent months. Our announced deal volume in the third quarter was up more than fivefold versus the second quarter and our investment banking client dialogs remain active. The bigger headline in investment banking, again in the third quarter, was equity underwriting where we generated $856 million in revenues, more than double the levels seen a year ago, marking our second highest quarter ever. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our year-to-date volumes climbed to $80 billion across 436 deals, including 77 initial public offerings. In global IPOs, we ranked number one and picked up approximately 180 basis points of market share versus last year. We also saw strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in 21 private transactions, a high profile direct listing, and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in various forms.  In debt underwriting, net revenues were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago. Though volumes normalized from the record pace seen in the second quarter, the high yield market in particular saw healthy levels of new issue activity. Our activity also included a number of novel structure transactions, particularly among industries most impacted by COVID-19 such as airlines, where we uniquely enabled clients to leverage a broader collateral base to access capital. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to support our clients and grow our market share, generating a solid number four ranking in global debt underwriting year to date. This performance reflects our long-term strategic focus on this business as well as the velocity of underwriting commitments on our balance sheet. Looking forward, our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the second quarter. Growth was supported by a ramp in M&A activity, as I noted earlier, as well as replenishment from equity and debt underwriting transactions. In particular, new M&A announcements are creating a pipeline for acquisition financing in the coming quarters. We are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FIG, consumer, healthcare, and industrials. Revenues from corporate lending were $35 million, reflecting lower results in relationship lending which includes the impact of tighter credit spreads on hedges. As I have noted before, for risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger lending commitments. Given the significant credit spread tightening over the last two quarters, we have now reversed the vast majority of the $375 million in hedge gains we saw in the first quarter. Also of note in relationship lending, we have seen material pay downs versus the first half. Total notional drawn on revolvers is now down 60% from the peak and nearing normalized levels. Moving to global markets on Page 5, where our businesses continued their strong performance, net revenues were $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up 29% versus a year ago amid attractive bid-offer spreads, a supportive market making backdrop, and continued elevated client activity.  We expanded our market share this year as our focus and commitment to serve clients during this volatile period drove results across asset classes and geographies. During the first half, McKinsey reported that Goldman Sachs Global Markets delivered the best institutional client performance among our global peers. Our strength was aided by number one rankings in both G10 rates and credit and the number one global ranking in equities, which included the number one position in EMEA and ties for number one in Asia and Japan. Turning to FIC on Page 6, third quarter net revenues were $2.5 billion, up 49% versus the third quarter of \u201919. Growth versus last year was driven by a 65% increase in intermediation, which more than offset a 9% decrease in financing revenues. In FIC intermediation, we had solid client flows and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year, leveraging our balance sheet to intermediate risk in a disciplined way.  In credit, performance was supported by strong client activity in the U.S. and tighter investment grade and high yield credit spreads. We also saw sustained volumes across our automated bond pricing engine.  In rates, revenues rose amid stronger risk management while client activity was solid, particularly around global central bank actions during the quarter. In commodities, strong performance was driven by our metals business and oil products amid persistent global supply imbalances. In mortgages, revenues rose amid higher levels of client activity in agency products, bolstered by solid risk management and tighter spreads. In currencies, revenues were stable as we continued to serve our global client franchise with contributions across both G10 and emerging markets. Lastly in FIC financing, we saw lower revenues in repo and structured finance. Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $2.1 billion, up 10% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36%, aided by higher client volumes across derivatives and cash, reflecting the scale and breadth of our client franchise. In derivatives, we saw solid activity in flow, structured, and corporate transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. In cash, we helped clients execute across both high and low touch channels. Equities financing revenues of $585 million declined 25% year over year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, average client balances rose to near record levels. Across global markets, we continued to invest in technology platforms to enhance client experience, build on our strength in risk management, and drive resource efficiencies. Like digital trends across many industries, COVID-19 has accelerated client adoption and on-boarding across our automated platforms. While it remains difficult to predict client activity and we do not have insight into the forward opportunity, we take confidence in the market share gains experienced by the business through a deepening set of client relationships, which has been a priority for the global markets leadership team. This progress should support revenue sustainability as we go forward. We also believe the upcoming U.S. election, the variability of economic growth outlook, and the 2021 global LIBOR transition may bolster client activity across markets. Additionally, to the extent that sustained low interest rates have their intended effect of stimulating economic growth and recovery, client activity may be further invigorated. Moving to asset management on Page 7, in the third quarter we generated segment revenues of $2.8 billion, up over 70% versus a year ago. Our third quarter revenues were driven by the continued market rebound, event-driven activity, and positive corporate performance of our portfolio companies. Management and other fees totaled $728 million, up 10% versus a year ago driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower fee rate due to mix shift given growth in liquidity and fixed income products.  Equity investments produced $1.4 billion of net gains, aided by appreciation in our public investments and valuation marks related to event-driven activity across our private equity portfolio. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated nearly $800 million in gains from investments, including BigCommerce, Avantor, Sprout, and HeadHunter. On our $16 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of more than $400 million from various positions, with the majority driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital markets activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $230 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $589 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected mostly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments which continued to rebound from the broader market sell-off in the first quarter. Let me now turn to Page 8, where we continue to provide transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet.  On the left side of this slide is our equity investment portfolio by sector, geography and vintage. Our private portfolio remains highly diversified with over 800 positions where excluding Global Atlantic, given its announced sale, none are larger than $425 million. We also provide insight into our $21 billion portfolio of CIEs primarily comprised of real estate investments, of which $12 billion are financed predominantly by non-recourse debt. The portfolio remains diversified by geography and real estate sector. On the right side of the slide, we show our $31 billion in lending and debt investments in the portfolio within the asset management segment, which includes $14 billion of debt investments and $17 billion of loans that are largely secured.  I\u2019ll now turn to consumer and wealth management on Page 9. In this segment, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the third quarter, up 13% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management AUS and higher consumer banking revenues. Wealth management and other fees of $957 million rose 9% versus last year, reflecting increased client transaction activity and higher assets under supervision, which rose 8% to $575 billion, including $24 billion of positive net inflows over the past 12 months.  Consumer banking revenues were a record $326 million in the third quarter, jumping 50% versus last year, reflecting net interest income from credit card lending, strong year over year deposit growth, and lower deposit rates. Consumer deposit totaled $96 billion, reflecting $4 billion of growth in the quarter. The slower pace was expected as we continued to limit U.K. new account growth in light of regulatory caps and reduced the rate on our U.S. market savings accounts given the lower interest rate environment. While we exhibited improving beta in our deposit book, we saw very limited outflows of deposits consistent with our expectations, despite two rate cuts during the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion, of which approximately $4 billion were from Marcus loans and $3 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. While we remain attentive to the embedded risk, we continue to be pleased with the credit performance of these portfolios.  Next, let\u2019s turn to Page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS decreased slightly to $2 trillion during the quarter, but are up approximately $275 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $90 billion of liquidity outflows following strong inflows in the first half, that offset by $51 billion of market appreciation and $18 billion of long term inflows.  On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.1 billion for the third quarter, up versus a year ago primarily reflecting growth in the firm\u2019s balance sheet particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from deposit growth and re-pricing in consumer and wealth management. Importantly, as I have noted in the past, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. Our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and predominantly hedged or floating rate liabilities. Nevertheless, even if interest rates remain low, we expect NII to gradually expand over time given our ability to prudently grow loans and further re-price consumer deposits. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $112 billion, down $5 billion sequentially driven by a $7 billion decrease in corporate loans from pay downs in relationship lending and a $1 billion reduction in Marcus installment loans, offset by modest growth in wealth management and credit card loans.  Our provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $278 million, meaningfully lower than the $1.59 billion taken last quarter and down 4% versus a year ago. This lower provision versus the second quarter reflects relative stability in our portfolio and improvements in the broader economic backdrop, which is the dominant driver of inputs to our modeling of pool reserves. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loan and commitments stood at $4.3 billion, including $3.7 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was stable versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $100 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 16.1%. The provision of $278 million includes wholesale impairments of approximately $230 million primarily relating to select credits in the TMT, industrials, and natural resources sectors. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $340 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 1.3%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter.  Next, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6 billion increased 6% versus last year, with compensation expenses up 14% year-over-year amidst higher revenue growth net of provisions, and non-compensation expenses down 2%. Higher compensation expenses reflected year-over-year growth in revenue net of credit provisions. Our non-comp expenses were slightly lower versus last year as we continued to invest in new businesses, including transaction banking and credit card as well as the United Capital acquisition, now rebranded Personal Financial Management.  While we benefited from lower expenses of approximately $100 million from the temporary reduction in travel, entertainment and advertising expenses due to COVID-19, we also saw an approximately $90 million reduction in litigation and professional fees and a roughly $50 million reduction in double occupancy-related costs from our new facilities in London and Bangalore. These were offset by a roughly $60 million increase in activity related expense from brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees, as well as a roughly $85 million increase related to technology investments across the firm. Our reported year to date efficiency ratio was 69.6%, which was burdened by nearly 10 percentage points of litigation expense. We continue to make progress on our expense savings initiatives as set forth at investor day and will continue to assess our ability to go further than what we outlined in January. Finally, our reported tax rate was 28% for the year to date, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% over the next few years. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 14.5% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 120 basis points sequentially. The improvement was driven primarily by earnings as well as lower market RWAs, reflecting reduced market volatility, and lower credit RWAs. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 110 basis points to 13%, also on earnings and RWA reductions from lower market volatility.  We are confident in our capital position, now 90 basis points above our 13.6% stress capital buffer requirement. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis as we execute our strategic initiatives, build more durable fee-based revenues, and reduce the stress loss intensity of our business. To that end, we will continue asset harvesting, including our announced sale of Global Atlantic. While our capital ratio will likely remain elevated near term given continued regulatory restrictions on share repurchases, we would expect our management buffer to decline over time, particularly as markets express less volatility. Importantly, we stand ready to commit capital and balance sheet to support our clients, and we expect to resume share repurchases once permitted consistent with our longstanding capital management policy. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, roughly flat versus last quarter. We maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $302 billion, up modestly versus last quarter, reflecting the current backdrop. We expect our GCLA will evolve in the context of client demand for our balance sheet and overall market conditions. On the liability side, our total deposits decreased to $261 billion, down $8 billion versus last quarter driven by planned roll-off of higher cost brokered deposits and more modest growth in retail deposits. Our long term debt declined by $9 billion during the quarter, driven by maturities. We expect issuance to remain relatively low for the remainder of the year, although we may consider pre-funding some planned first quarter 2021 issuances. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, and flexibility in our highly liquid balance sheet. Despite the continued overhang from COVID-19 and challenges from the work-from-home environment, we continue to leverage our technology platforms and intellectual capital to support our clients. During this difficult time, we remain dedicated to executing our strategy in our core business and driving forward the new initiatives and operating efficiency programs we laid out in January. Importantly, we have been proud to see our dedicated client engagement efforts continue to pay off, resulting in gains in mind share and market share as we help clients navigate this volatile environment. On the forward, our risk managers will remain in a conservative posture given the uncertain trajectory of the virus and early stages of the recovery to ensure we are well positioned to proactively support our clients.  While our path to our medium term targets will inevitably not be a straight line, we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues, and higher returns for shareholders over time. With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we\u2019ll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Obviously, great trading results. I\u2019m curious if you could characterize any--how you think about any incremental risk you take to execute all that, and if there\u2019s any impact on future stress tests. I\u2019m just looking to balance client franchise with any risks associated with it. Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure Glenn, thanks. I would say the performance of the trading businesses in the third quarter, frankly like it was in throughout most of the first part of the year was really done with an eye toward high velocity turn on balance sheet; that is, we were very well prepared to commit capital to facilitate intermediation but saw our mission equally as moving and trading on that risk very efficiently, and so we could see the kind of turnover that we needed. We didn\u2019t see dramatic pick-up in risk occasioned by that pattern and that strategy, and I think that leaves us in a good position with respect to what we will submit as part of the second version of CCAR, and I don\u2019t see our risk as being unusually elevated in the context of producing these kinds of results. Glenn Schorr : That\u2019s great. Then I missed it - I don\u2019t know if you gave us the realized versus unrealized split. I think I wrote down everything you said on the equity -- I\u2019m talking the equity investment line, I couldn\u2019t tell how much of it was actually realized. The lead or the follow-on to that is, have you considered monetizing more with markets at all-time highs? You have a pretty seasoned portfolio with two-thirds in the four to eight years old-plus range, so I\u2019m looking to see how you balance the capital intensity of those investments with the earnings power and what your capital deployment options are right now. Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure, no problem. Let me just go through the breakdown in equities. Of the $1.4 billion in revenue, our public portfolio generated $781 million in revenue, and the private part of the equity portfolio generated $642 million. Now importantly, when you look at the private portfolio, $284 million of that $642 million was generated on events, so that\u2019s sales, monetizations, IPOs, and the like, and $52 million - only $52 million - was non-event driven, that is looking at the baseline performance of the underlying company and making a judgement about where value is appropriately pegged, and so event being the dominant component of the private portfolio. The balance, I should point out, of $306 million relates to CIEs. As it relates to the public portfolio, we observe the market no differently than you do. Obviously, there\u2019s a certain component of that public portfolio that remains restricted. A decent amount of it remains unrestricted, and we will look for opportunities as we have been to monetize those stakes. By the way, I say that not just simply in the context of an attractive market valuation in which to sell but equally in the context of the kind of broader strategic mission we\u2019ve been on, which is to lower the balance sheet intensity and capital intensity of that as we shift to more third party investing itself, and so that you a bit of the lay of the land as to the two components to your question. Glenn Schorr : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning David and Stephen. Maybe sticking with the trading question, Stephen, you gave some pretty interesting color on why you think trading revenues should be sustainable into 2021. Can you expand on those a bit? I\u2019m particularly interested in your point around LIBOR transition? Just give us more detail there and sort of why you think Goldman is well placed to capitalize. Stephen Scherr : Sure, so why don\u2019t I start with trading. I think at the core, our view on sustainability is not with a crystal ball and a forward forecast as to what the opportunity set will be. It is more rooted in the fact that over the course of the year and looking at data through the first half, we have picked up meaningful market share in and among various client sets across all of the businesses in our trading business. This was a very concerted effort on the part of the leadership of that business to go at finding ourselves moving up the ladder in the top 1,000 clients that matter to the trading division. The sustainability of our performance for me is rooted more in the fact that we\u2019ve picked up share gains. We were there for clients particularly during the most volatile moments of the second quarter across all asset classes without withdrawing, and I think it sets us up to capture whatever the opportunity set is on the forward.  My comments in the prepared remarks is that as I look forward to the fourth quarter, we can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether that\u2019s U.S. election, LIBOR transition, the trajectory of COVID - any one of those, and part of the reason that we are at capital levels we are, part of the reason we have maintained higher liquidity than we ordinarily would, is such that we can serve clients should that volatility occur without putting ourselves offside on any one of those metrics. I think that\u2019s part of the color I\u2019d give you both in terms of what\u2019s sustainable, and equally why we feel confident that we\u2019ve put our financial resources in a proper frame to play on the volatility itself. Just lastly on your question about LIBOR transition, we\u2019ve had a dedicated team - I mean, people who are 100% dedicated to this effort from the beginning. We\u2019ve put ourselves in a position where we\u2019ve done issuance, we have prepared ourselves in terms of counterparty contracts and the like, and I think we\u2019re very well prepared. Obviously, we don\u2019t skew in ways in which commercial banks do with LIBOR based elements in mortgages and the like, but in the scope of what is our business, we feel quite well prepared for that onset. Christian Bolu : Great, thank you. Maybe switching to acquisitions, again maybe David this one is for you, given the frenzy at Morgan Stanley on deals, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about M&A, maybe what businesses or initiatives would benefit from an acquisition, and then if you can just touch on how you think your relative currency and capital position places you to do a transformative deal. David Solomon : Christian, I appreciate the question, and of course we laid out a medium-term plan with a set of goals, and you and others continue to ask us about this. We\u2019re on a journey to continue to strengthen our returns and broaden our business to create a more diverse business with more sustainable revenues over time. We now have the business, we think, fully set up and organized after we re-segmented last year and made some changes internally so that the platforms that we think we can really operate from are well positioned to grow, and this includes our two more traditional platforms that everybody is always focused on, investment banking and global markets, which really for lack of a better term is a corporate investment bank. We have a big asset management platform which is global, broad, deep, multi-product all over the world, and we think there are opportunities to continue to grow that organically for sure, but certainly we\u2019d consider inorganic opportunities to grow that if we thought that they were enhancing. And then, we obviously are building a broader consumer wealth platform to serve individuals and we certainly think there can be opportunities to accelerate the growth of that. In fact, last year we made an acquisition in United Capital that we think accelerated our expansion into high net worth wealth in a meaningful way, and we\u2019ve now been integrating that quite successfully. So we continue to look broadly at things that can extend our strategy and accelerate the pace. It\u2019s clear if you look at the actions of others that the market has been tolerant of tangible book value dilution in the context of something they think is on strategy and advances the trajectory of the business, so we\u2019ll continue to look and see if there are opportunities; but other than that, it would be hard for me to say anything more at this point. Christian Bolu : That\u2019s helpful, thank you, David. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mike Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First one, just on your efficiency ratio, you guys beat the 60% this quarter and year to date, ex the legal, you\u2019re at the 60%. I guess the big takeaway is the operating leverage clearly works in the model, but can you provide some color of maybe where you\u2019re at in the investment and efficiency three-year timeline? Most of it is just to help with the expense trend line - you know, the efficiency ratio outlook, depending on how the revenue backdrop plays out. David Solomon : I\u2019ll start and Stephen might give some more granular detail, but I\u2019d say that at a high level, Michael, and appreciate the question, there\u2019s no question that our efficiency has benefited from an environment which has allowed us an opportunity in some of our businesses to capture more revenues, and some of that, as Stephen highlighted, is really due to market share gains and we think that will be more sticky. Some of it is due to the environment. There is no question as we looked at our three-year trajectory and thinking about our desire to run the firm more efficiently that this environment and the crisis slowed down some of the actions we might have taken during this year. We\u2019ve now begun to deal with some things from an efficiency perspective that we might have dealt with earlier in the year, and we then have two more years to go through and execute that plan.  We continue to be very committed to that plan. We continue to be very comfortable with that plan. We actually think there might be things that we\u2019ve seen or we\u2019re learned that may create more opportunities for us to advance from that plan, but at this point our intention is to give you a more detailed granular update when we review our plan in January at the next earnings call. Stephen, is there anything you\u2019d want to add to that? Stephen Scherr : You know, Mike, the only thing I would add to David\u2019s comment is that I think that on the forward, we\u2019re going to continue to look at strategic value locations as areas where we can grow and develop a number of different businesses, particularly the newer ones. I would say automation continues to be a priority for us across the whole of the firm - you know, automating what goes on in risk and the various control functions, and equally automating platforms that have captured the attention of client sets. I\u2019d also say that--look, it\u2019s hard to look at one quarter as a spot for efficiency. Obviously it\u2019s important to look out the whole year, but equally this is a medium term journey that we\u2019re on, and I think some of those will--some of the items that I mentioned, that David mentioned will bear fruit in terms of creating greater operating leverage.  The last thing I\u2019d say is that we have said on prior earnings calls that it\u2019s important to look at operating expenses in totality because as we continue to build businesses like transaction banking, like the consumer business, they will be less human intensive, they will be more automate, and therefore we move away from the compensation intensity associated with those businesses as a general matter. I think there are a number of levers to pull over the medium term. Mike Carrier : All right, that\u2019s helpful. Just a follow-up on Glenn\u2019s asset management question, one of the things we\u2019ve seen in some of the private companies is they\u2019ve been slower to rebound, given the economic backdrop, so any insight you can provide on the private portfolio companies, either those facing more COVID-related pressure or those that aren\u2019t, and if that will have an impact beyond the pace of monetization. Stephen Scherr : Sure, so as we looked across the portfolio and we did it in the first quarter, did it in the second and again did it in the third, we look at those that are most acutely impacted by COVID. Their circumstance in some sense hasn\u2019t changed, and they remain untouched from the downward mark pressure and valuation that we saw in the first and second quarter. There are others that have turned the corner as being affected by COVID, and that is as much a function of where the market is moving, where consumers are moving and the like. Then there are others that historically have been untouched by this, and so I would say we continue to look at it through the frame of COVID impact and equally we look obviously at the underlying performance of the business, and not exclusively as against public market comparables and the like. By the way, this is of course for that part of the private portfolio not otherwise marked, given other events that are going on, so that frame remains the same in terms of how we look at that portfolio itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Manan Gosalia : Hi, good morning. This is Manan Gosalia on for Betsy Graseck. I wanted to ask on your capital levels, I know you said you expect to manage to about a 13% to 13.5% CET1 ratio over time, but can you speak to where you expect to maintain capital in the near term, at least until the 2021 stress test? Do you expect to maintain the same buffer over your required minimum as you did this quarter, or--you know, I know you mentioned that you could see strong activity in the markets in 4Q with the election and the market rebound. Is there more room to be a little bit more nimble and maybe increase exposure and market RWAs in the fourth quarter? Stephen Scherr : Sure. I think we\u2019ve brought our CET1 ratio to 14.5% really to sort of fix ourselves in a competitive position in anticipation, as I said, of the potential for volatility and higher trading over the course of the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again that we run roughly with a 50 to 100 basis point buffer. Where within that range we stand, obviously at the higher end now, is equally a function of volatility from a risk management point of view - that is, we\u2019re in a market that is more likely to express higher, not lower. As and to the extent that that volatility subsides, we will see the buffer come down and will adjust, again consistent with where we are. On the longer term trend, over the medium to longer term, the reinforcement of 13% to 13.5% is more a reflection, I think as I\u2019ve said in the comments, of a forward direction to create, and as David noted, lower stress loss impact in the overall composition of the business, meaning as we continue to pursue certain of our strategic initiatives which create more durable fee-based revenue, lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet intensity, we\u2019ll be in a position where I think the requirement of us will come down and therefore over the medium term, we\u2019ll move more in that direction. Manan Gosalia : Great, thank you. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the M&A advisory front? We\u2019re seeing the announcement come through, both your own and the industry, M&A announcements have been pretty strong in the third quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you\u2019re hearing from corporates and sponsors, and how long do you think this increase in announcements can persist into next year? David Solomon : There\u2019s no question that earlier in the year, given the dramatic nature of the start of the pandemic and the uncertainty that persisted, M&A activity came to a screeching halt, and really through the second quarter, new announcements and activity levels were quite low. Stephen made comments with respect to the pick-up in our backlog. We\u2019ve seen an increase in activity. I think we see an increase in activity and announcements but also an increased dialog, and I would say that CEO confidence has improved meaningfully in the quarter. It\u2019s still not at the high elevated levels that might have been at the beginning of the year, but CEO confidence and the dialog we\u2019re having is certainly improved.  Against that backdrop, I would expect to see numerous companies trying to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen position. I think one of the things that\u2019s going on in the crisis is people are seeing that there continues to be efficiency in scale. As the world continues to digitize, it requires greater investment, and that obviously advantages companies with scale.  Our base case, based on what we\u2019re seeing, is that his increase in activity will continue through the rest of the year into 2021, but I would say that you\u2019ve got to be flexible and understand that if for some reason, the course of the pandemic or the economic trajectory changes some of that confidence that\u2019s currently building, that could slow down, but at the moment activity levels appear quite good. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawkin with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawkin : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. David, you referenced that you\u2019ll be providing an update to the strategic goals and targets that you laid out on the fourth quarter call, and you said you are committed--you remain committed to those goals, so that\u2019s encouraging, certainly in light of some of the stories we\u2019ve seen in the press which were a little confusing. But I wanted to, number one, confirm that the--a refute of the press reports that you are considering backing away from those targets and also hear how loan and deposit growth experience through 2020 has compare to your pre-pandemic expectations, and how long should we think about a headwind from the liquidity, the excess liquidity that you guys are holding as a hindrance to NII. How temporary is that likely to be? Thanks. David Solomon : Okay, so a couple things. First, and I just want to be very clear about it, it\u2019s one article. I saw the article. The article was wrong, it was incorrect. We\u2019ve never considered changing our targets. There\u2019s been no discussion about it, so we\u2019re committed to our targets and we\u2019re making progress on our targets. I don\u2019t have anything really else to say about the article, other than it was incorrect. With respect to the second part of your question, and I\u2019m sorry - I\u2019m now on the third part of your question, where you\u2019re asking about deposits. There was something in the middle, right? Stephen Scherr : Loans. David Solomon : Oh, about-- Brennan Hawkin : Lending. Stephen Scherr : Lending versus our expectations before the pandemic. David Solomon : Sure, so when you look at deposits--that\u2019s right, deposit growth and loan growth. When you look at deposit growth, what I\u2019d say, and we talked about this in last quarter\u2019s call, deposit growth and the acceleration of our ability to attract digital deposits definitely accelerated during this year because of the pandemic, faster than we had expected. We\u2019ve obviously been managing that flow, and you saw in this quarter based on actions we took that we slowed down the growth in that deposit rate because we had well exceeded what we expected to do for the year.  At the same point in time, when you look at the consumer business which still remains very, very small, as we entered the pandemic we had the ability to be more controlled on the growth of that portfolio. We remain committed to the targets we set out in our investor day in January, but it didn\u2019t seem as we entering the pandemic and there was such uncertainty during the bulk of this year, that we should be leaning in toward driving those targets. My expectation would be if the economic environment continues to improve, you\u2019ll see an improvement in that loan growth as we head into 2021, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor that appropriately and cautiously. Brennan Hawkin : That\u2019s clear, thanks. Then when we think about the expense side, comp clearly had a big benefit here this quarter. Is the best way to look at that year to date? I know the fourth quarter is an important one for when you guys true up the pool and consider competitive dynamics and the like, but any additional color you can provide there? When we think about comp ratio, should we think about it net of provision or gross? You referred--I think, Stephen, you referred to it net of provision in your prepared remarks, but in prior times it was referred to as gross, so just wanted to try to square that a bit. Thank you. David Solomon : Brennan, at a high level, and Stephen made comments on this too, but at a high level as we develop different businesses, and Stephen pointed to this, we\u2019re developing businesses that have a different component of people cost than some of our businesses had had historically. When we set a comp ratio, we are always thinking based on the information we have at the time what do we think is necessary to pay our people competitively and protect our franchise. PCLs are a cost of doing business. It\u2019s a reflection of the capital that\u2019s embedded in the businesses, and it obviously affects that judgement. In a year where there were very, very low PCLs, the difference between those two ratios is very little. In a year where there are very significant PCLs, given the nature of the time we\u2019re on in the cycle, obviously there\u2019s a big difference and that will weigh more heavily in those years. But we continue to see real operating leverage in our business as we execute on our strategy, as things continue to digitize and we continue to automate, but in addition we have excellent people in a number of businesses that need to be paid when people perform, and we\u2019ll stay very, very focused on making sure that we\u2019re competitively and well positioned, but you\u2019re seeing some of the operating leverage come through on the business. Stephen Scherr : Brennan, I would just point out that through three quarters, when you look at comp as a percentage of revenue net of provisions, we are spot on to where we were last year, and so there\u2019s obviously no change in philosophy. I think David gave you all the reasons why it\u2019s important that we take stock of provisions in the context of looking at that. I would say, though, more generally it\u2019s important to focus on the efficiency ratio of the firm over an extended period of time, because as I said earlier, comp will be inevitably but one component of a set of operating expenses by which the firm is carrying itself, so I think efficiency ratio will be a better indicator of the firm\u2019s ability to manage.  But that\u2019s not to ignore the focus and the view into comp as an expense, and so I think part of what David and I have told you gives you a sense of how we\u2019re looking at it relative to provisions and where it sits on a year-to-date basis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  First question, just want to touch on the stock for a moment. Looking at the stock, the price is down $20 year to date, book value is up about $10, you\u2019ve put one MDB behind you, you had a record EPS quarter today. Just want to think a little bit about you guys talk about the stock price internally. You essentially have laid out a transparent plan for the business, you\u2019ve set long term initiatives that imply a business shift towards higher multiple areas, so I\u2019m just curious if the mentality is that as you execute on the plan over time, the price will just take care of itself, or are we maybe getting to a point where it makes sense to take more of a stand around stock, just given that it has implications for how you run the business. David Solomon : Well you know, Devin, I think you\u2019ve laid this out very well. We\u2019ve put out a plan, we believe we\u2019re executing. We\u2019ve got a lot more work to do. If we execute, I assume the stock will follow, and we\u2019re focused on shareholder value. We\u2019re focused on the medium to longer term, and I feel good--we feel good as a leadership team as to how we\u2019re progressing. But there\u2019s more work to do and our assumption is if we continue to deliver consistently over the medium and longer term, shareholders will benefit and the stock price will perform. Devin Ryan : Okay, thanks David. Just a follow-up here on the consumer business. There was several changes to leadership in consumer and wealth during the quarter. I\u2019m just curious if that implies any focus in shift in the business, or just any color around implications there to strategy or how the business is run. David Solomon : There\u2019s no focus in strategy or how the business should be run. One of the things that I believe very strongly and that we\u2019ve been driving toward as a management team since we took over as a management team two years ago was getting the way we talk about the business to be set up in a way where we could transparently talk about our different big business platforms, and to have those businesses aligned with the way we were running the business internally. That is not something that traditionally we had. We had external segments, we had different divisions internally.  We made segment shifts at the end of last year to set up the platforms the way we expected to run them, and the announcements we made now get people who are driving the strategy and moving those platforms forward aligned with the way we talk about the businesses to you, to the investing community, to our shareholders, and we feel that\u2019s an important step forward. So there\u2019s no change, but rather just a continuation of the journey we\u2019ve been on to get the firm aligned up and set up now with these four big platforms that we really think we can drive growth over time. Stephen Scherr : Devin, the only thing I would add, just to touch on the specifics of performance within the consumer business, so overall the Marcus unsecured loans closed the quarter at a lower balance than where it began the year, and Apple Card balances were higher than where we ended the year. Both of those were very purposeful in the context of managing through a young portfolio in an uncertain moment with respect to the consumer. I would also say that the loss behavior, if you will, or the credit behavior of that portfolio is outperforming our modeled expectations; that is, losses have been coming down relative to that which was otherwise budgeted or forecasted, which is as much a function of how we\u2019ve managed underwriting on the entry, how we\u2019ve managed customers under customer assistance plans and the like, so that just gives you a sense of where performance lies in the context of David\u2019s comments. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I think my question is rooted in my business school class, when I read In Search of Excellence, and it said stick to your knitting. I\u2019m not sure if you recall that old book, and maybe it\u2019s just too ancient, but when I look at your business, the capital market side - I mean, you\u2019re clearly gaining wallet share. It reminds of 2009 when you were successful in supporting your customers through the last recession. On the other hand, the expansion businesses - you know, buying into credit cards, one concern I hear is you\u2019re just buying into a lower PE activity. You certainly seem committed on that strategy, but it seems like there\u2019s still questions there. Specific questions on the side where there\u2019s a lot more confidence, the legacy businesses of capital markets, your M&A backlog, how does that compare to the all-time high, and trading, by how much has the wallet share gain been to the environment because VIX is so high, versus new business, so that\u2019s on the positive side? And on the less confident side, the growth, what do you bring when you buy a credit card that the seller wasn\u2019t providing before? Thanks. David Solomon : There was a lot there, Mike, and so if I--I appreciate all the questions, if I don\u2019t get them all. I just want to highlight, I don\u2019t remember the book because I didn\u2019t go to business school.  But as I try to pick through and answer, first on M&A backlog, I think Stephen said this, while M&A backlog strengthened during the quarter, it\u2019s not back to where it was at the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s certainly not at its all-time high.  With respect to market share gains, in global markets I think the market share gains, we believe as a management team that the market share gains are rooted in an evolution back of our strategy to really being very, very client centric, our One GS approach, and really trying to think about how we as an organization deliver for our clients in a very central way. This is core to the way we\u2019re running the whole firm. It\u2019s been a big initiative over the last two years, and we think it\u2019s having a real impact on the way our clients interact with us and our ability to serve our clients, and we think that\u2019s helping our market share. Certainly the volume levels, I think at this moment in time, are elevated, the overall activity levels are elevated to some degree based on the pandemic and the volatility in markets. But I think the market share is coming from the way we\u2019re executing a strategy, and we began that focus well before COVID. We began that focus two years ago, and I think we\u2019re really getting results from that investment. The third thing with respect to the credit card business, it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019re in any business that has a lower PE than the current PE that we trade at, but when you look at our vision for what we\u2019re trying to do in building a digital consumer platform that marries our strong expertise in wealth while also providing a digital experience for general banking services for consumers, we\u2019re committed to it, we believe in it, but we want to be perfectly clear - this is something that\u2019s going to be built over a long period of time, just like we announced today with an extraordinary franchise where we have over $2 trillion of assets under supervision. That\u2019s been built over a very long period of time, and we believe it\u2019s really accreted to the value of Goldman Sachs and our shareholders over a very long period of time. We\u2019re going to continue to work at this cautiously. I know there\u2019s skepticism out there. We\u2019re going to prove over time as to why we think it\u2019s right, and we\u2019ll continue to advance it. Mike Mayo : I\u2019m going to ask you a question that\u2019s not really your responsibility, but it goes back to an earlier question. On a day like today and last quarter, the market seems to be giving you a PE of one or even less one-year earnings. I think there\u2019s a disconnect between the lumpiness of your capital markets revenues with the annuity-like nature of your customer relationships, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any way that you could put in context the recurring nature of the bulk of the capital markets activity, even while parts are lumpy. I think some shareholders are very frustrated, as was reflected by the earlier question.  I know your view is, look, stock prices follow earnings. You\u2019ve had a focus on growing book value. Let\u2019s grow book value and everything else will take care of itself. Is that still the way you think about that? David Solomon : Well, I think your last statement is true, but I\u2019ll make a couple of other comments at a high level and it would offer a perspective. I know, Mike, you\u2019d have a perspective on this too. For sure we\u2019re going to continue to focus on performing, and I think over time it will take care of itself. At a high level, the banking sector and financials broadly are well out of favor, so it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re sitting in a unique position. If you look at the people that you would benchmark us against and you look at how they trade on a relative basis, people are pretty clustered in the neighborhood. Is that something that I think is permanent? No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permanent. Can you and I both speculate as to reasons why people feel that way at this point in the cycle, and with some of the uncertainty? Absolutely. I do think, to your point, the client franchise and the capital markets revenues that we have are, if you\u2019re looking at it not quarter to quarter but over periods of time as a franchise business, there is volatility in it compared to some businesses, but over any meaningful period of time, they generate lots of revenues, lots of earnings very consistently, so part of it depends on the frame through which you look. We can certainly go back over long periods of time and see how the client franchise and the strength of the client franchise continues to do well. We really believe when we focus on clients, that revenue will be sustained in the context of the market opportunity. As a business, we operate in a business that might have more short term volatility than some other businesses that are out there, that people benchmark in some way. I think it\u2019s an interesting time because of the pandemic and the uncertainty, so I think that hurts the overall neighborhood; but I continue to believe that we have big platforms, we have scale, we have leadership positions, those things are sticky. The things that we do are not going to go away, and if we focus on our clients and delivering for shareholders over time, I believe the stock price will follow. Stephen Scherr : You know, Mike, an interesting development, just to amplify on David\u2019s comment, which is that even in the trading businesses, which one could argue are volatile in the context of the market, on certain of the electronic platforms that we\u2019re seeing, and I would speak specifically about the credit platform, we are seeing an increasing number of our clients come to those platforms, transact on those platforms. Now, that may be a function of work-from-home and the disposition of those clients, but we\u2019re seeing a growing presence. Their attachment to those platforms, whether it\u2019s marquee or otherwise, is sticky and tends to stay there, perhaps even more than what you might see in a high touch versus low touch. Getting into that in a business that you would not otherwise expect to be as predictable, if you will, I think is just something to take note in the context of your question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. A quick question on the CET1 ratio. I noticed there was a meaningful reduction in the RWAs quarter on quarter, and I heard you talk about some of the environment, just being probably seasonality, impacting that. But can you kind of tease out the change in the RWA between what was more seasonality activity versus where you actively managed those RWAs lower to ensure you got over your SCB minimums? Stephen Scherr : Yes, so I think on one hand, if you look on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s a question of volatility, so we\u2019d see it higher than not by virtue of volatility; otherwise, on a quarter on quarter basis, you see the positional set change, reduce exposure, certain diversification effect which plays to the positive, so there was no meaningful uptick in risk in the context of where RWA deployment otherwise was. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, and then when you think about the CET1 ratio target that you\u2019re running to, obviously that assumes the SCB would improve for you from here. What are some of the actions that you\u2019re taking to get the SCB lower so that you can run at a 13% to 13.5% with the management buffer over the near term? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Well, I think over the medium term, I think if you look at the various initiatives that we articulated at investor day and are executing on now, whether it is transaction banking, the consumer business, what we\u2019re doing with respect to our alts business, all of those will reduce the stress loss intensity of our business overall. Transaction banking will be a fee generating proposition. The alternatives business equally will give us a more durable thread of fees, and at the same time take down the capital and balance sheet intensity that otherwise weighs on the capital calculation. I think all of those are geared with an eye toward reducing down, as I said, stress loss intensity and ultimately leading to a lower SCB itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary around M&A and maybe the spillover impact on acquisition advance, but if think about what\u2019s been going on this year in terms of significant capital raising, both equity, DCM, how do we think about that going forward? It sounds like you\u2019ve replenished some of the coffer in terms of the pipeline. How much demand is there to shore up balance sheets and for capital markets activity, or is it a yin and yang where M&A picks up and capital raising comes down, and we don\u2019t really grow banking much? Just trying to think through that level of activity. David Solomon : Jim, I think it\u2019s a hard thing. I think it\u2019s a hard thing to look at and predict with granularity. There\u2019s no question that the environment pulled forward--both pulled forward some financing for companies and also created a whole bunch of financings that, if we didn\u2019t have this environment, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. There\u2019s no question that financing levels have been elevated during this year. At the same point in time, if again--and this goes back to my point as people think about this, if we get out of the mode of kind of thinking quarter to quarter to quarter, and we look at these as huge franchises where we have leading share and we\u2019re well positioned, I believe over any period of time - three years, five years, seven years, 10 year - there\u2019s going to be enormous corporate financing activity and we will have leading share in participating in that, and that will be a big profitable business that will enhance our franchise and help drive earnings growth and book value growth. So in the short term, it\u2019s hard for me to speculate. I mean, I would speculate that if things normalize, which I expect them to, we will not see the same velocity of financing in 2021 that we saw in 2020 as people tried to adapt and finance themselves out to create more runway, given the uncertainty in the environment. Again, big franchise, big opportunity, and whatever the market puts forward, I think we\u2019re well positioned to serve our clients and capture it. Jim Mitchell : Maybe as a follow-up on that, maybe you could update us on your efforts to expand market share. You\u2019ve talked about going down market into the middle market. How has the progress been on that? David Solomon : I appreciate that question, Jim. The progress is going quite well, and I think one of the things that I know is self evident to everybody on the call, as market cap grows, there are more and more companies that grow into being worth $500 million, a billion, $2 billion that have never been on our radar screen, so that footprint has expanded meaningfully and there\u2019s been hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue accretion based on the opportunity set that\u2019s come from that, and I think that will continue.  I feel good about the way that platform expansion is going, and I think there continues to be more opportunity for us over time to continue to add to that footprint. Operator : You have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. What is your appetite for asset management acquisitions, and along with that, I know you\u2019ve mentioned ROE and ROTCE, you\u2019ve always been very cognizant of having a lot of goodwill, and you don\u2019t have so much. So what\u2019s your appetite for asset management deals and what\u2019s your appetite for goodwill, and do you still have the same focus on ROE as much as ever? David Solomon : I think, Mike, that I\u2019m not going to say anything in response to this that\u2019s different to what I said just a few minutes ago. We are making investments to grow our business, our asset management business organically. Certainly the strategy we\u2019ve laid out in alternatives and the mix shift and the way we\u2019re approaching that is an organic effort. We certainly are aware of the continued consolidation that\u2019s going on in the asset management industry. We feel very well positioned as a very, very large global, broad and deep active asset manager. As opportunities come up, we\u2019ll consider them if we think they can enhance our franchise and allow us to expand the strength of our franchise and our ability to serve our institutional clients, and also individual clients through our wealth business. To the degree that we thought something would really enhance our ability to drive that platform, we would take on the goodwill that was necessary to do it. We\u2019re not afraid of that. We haven\u2019t seen the right opportunity for us at the moment, and so we\u2019ll continue to grow the business organically. If the right thing came along inorganically, we\u2019d take a very hard look at it. Stephen Scherr : Okay, since there are no more questions in the queue, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather; otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 19, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. Heather Kennedy Miner : Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference both our strategic update and the earnings presentations, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in both presentations. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. This morning we are pleased to review the firm's fourth quarter and full year performance in addition to providing an update on the strategic plan we outlined at last year's Investor Day. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks Heather, and thank you to everybody for joining us this morning. Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs, as we successfully navigated unexpected operating backdrop characterized by near record volatility and correspondingly high client activity. This year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by COVID-19 and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course. This volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes, which was met by profound physical and monetary action taken across the globe. Goldman Sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firm's liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk and remediation, financing solutions, advice, and innovative thought leadership. Momentum remains strong into year-end as we produce record revenues for the fourth quarter of $11.7 billion resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. For the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $44.6 billion, our highest revenue production in more than a decade, which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage. We delivered a full year ROE of 11.1%, notwithstanding nearly 4 percentage point impact of litigation expense. This revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout 2020. While industry wallet grew, we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We maintained our leading global position and completed M&A as we have for 19 of the past 20 years, and strong lead table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity and equity linked offerings and a top-three ranking in high-yield. We delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities and solid client activity across our global platform, and grew market share across businesses and client groups. Our next-generation trading talent, now in positions of leadership, demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set. In asset management we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision. We also generated solid revenues from our balance sheet investments driven by public marks and event driven gains on our portfolio. We continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transition to more third-party investing. We continue to provide high quality advice to our wealth management clients producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints. While we are cautiously optimistic, given improving macro trends, we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve. Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., UK and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. Let me underscore the progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally. I urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan. In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed. Economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for near-term growth. The expectation is it will take until at least the second quarter to return to pre-pandemic levels of output. Our economists expect GDP growth this year of roughly 6.5% both globally and in the U.S., which would suggest a more rapid recovery. Though circumstances around COVID-19 remained fluid and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy, looking ahead the extreme volatility of 2020 is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year. Nevertheless, I am confident that Goldman Sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in 2020 across an expanding client set, particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management. With that, let me turn to Page 2. In the 12 months since our Investor Day, we have made steady progress towards our medium-term goals and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer-term goal of mid teens or higher returns. Our 2020 ROE when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation comfortably exceeds our 13% medium-term target. We are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by $70 billion in 2020. While the Fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates, we have since adjusted our pricing, which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by 2022. We are making headway and realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the $1.3 billion initial target we presented at our Investor Day. We will continue to make progress from here and we will evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings. Finally, with respect to capital, our CET1 ratio stands at 14.7%. This positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter. We continue to believe that a 13% to 13.5% ratio is appropriate for the firm over the medium-term. We are encouraged by the results of the recent mid-cycle stress test. That said, we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses, including through continued sales of our on balance sheet private equity investments. As John, Stephen and I have emphasized many times, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress. We are tracking roughly 30 firm-wide KPIs and many additional business level metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy. Let me now turn to Page 3. While last January's Investor Day seems distant given the events of the past year, the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged. Our strategy is simple; first, to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set; second, to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream, and third to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization. We are seeing early success in each category. Moving to Page 4, the strength of our firm's culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals in the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in 2020. Delivering the entire firm to our clients through our One Goldman Sachs approach is crucial to our mission and clients remain the center of everything we do. The investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward. Equally, core to our mission is delivering on our firm's purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose is fundamental to our 10-year, $750 billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across two broad pillars; climate transition and inclusive growth. During the year we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise, develop capabilities, and accelerate commercial activity. We are delivering integrated ESG solutions across our client base, and I'm proud of the firm's leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients. As we pursue these ambitious goals, we will also continue to focus on our people. Diversity is an imperative for our organization. For Goldman Sachs it is about bringing diverse people, perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders and fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive sustainable growth that is core to our long-term business strategy. While our recent progress is encouraging, including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner and managing director classes, the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm. This remains a personal priority for me and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements, including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm. Let me now take you through each of our four operating segments. I will start with investment banking, where we remain the advisor of choice for corporations around the world and 2020 is measured against the goals set out at our Investor Day, we maintained our number one ranking and announced and completed M&A and equity and equity linked offerings. We also ranked in the top-four for wallet share in global debt underwriting through the third quarter. We spoke last January about our aim to grow share in our core business. We began to execute on this goal in 2020 as announced M&A deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share. On our footprint expansion efforts we have met our Investor Day target for client coverage. We generated in excess of $800 million of revenue in 2020 from this client set and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward. Across the business we have added approximately 2700 net new clients since 2017 and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this space. We are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for investment banking given the robust activity levels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving CO [ph] confidence reflected in our near record backlog at the end of the year. We are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform with which since its launch last June has attracted roughly 225 corporate clients and nearly $30 billion of deposits and is well-positioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm. A combination of our [indiscernible] product offering, strong client receptivity, and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment, drove deposit growth ahead of expectations. As we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their on-boarding, we will convert more of these deposits to operation providing increased funding utility to the firm. We also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with Stripe which embeds our transaction banking payment and deposit solutions directly into Stripes' platform, making these products available to its millions of small business customers. Let me now turn to Page 6. In 2020 our global markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade, exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at Investor Day. Global markets is a business that many believe should have been downsized when John, Stephen, and I took our seats. While it's only a single year, the performance of the business in 2020 is an early validation of our decision to stay the course. Our teams worked diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of 2020 providing liquidity across asset classes in a mediating risk and engaging instruction solutions, while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms. We also advanced on our Investor Day objective of moving into a top-three position with more of the top-100 institutional clients. We are now in the top-three across 64 of these firms, up from 51 a year ago. We gained 120 basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of 2020, which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships, superior risk intermediation, and ongoing investment in technology platforms. We set a goal in January to increase our client financing activity. A record six financing revenues were 2020 demonstrate our ability to meet this target. Additionally, we continue to strengthen our prime business where we closed the year with record balances, the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other client oriented initiatives particularly in the Quant space. Finally, while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets, we remain focused on operating efficiencies. We achieved roughly $400 million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated $1.25 billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities, both ahead of schedule. Across any level of industry wallet, the progress that we have made in global markets has improved. The business is structural return profile. Let me now turn to Page 7. Our asset management business experienced solid performance in 2020 marked by continued growth in assets under supervision driving record management and other fees. Our status as one of the world's leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period. Our Asset management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum, from liquidity to alternatives and we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients' needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice, investment solutions, and portfolio implementation. We are progressing well towards our longer term objectives of $250 billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and $100 billion of net inflows to alternatives. To that end we spoke at Investor Day about growing our third-party alternatives business and we are pleased with our early achievements. We have raised approximately $40 billion in commitments to date across asset classes, including private equity, private credit, and real estate. This is good progress toward our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising over five years. Additionally, we are encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with Goldman Sachs. Many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent funding offering are new investing clients to the firm. As we shift towards a greater emphasis on third-party funds, we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our asset management business. To that end, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of growth equity investments in 2020, with a related $2 billion of expected lower capital. We will continue to advance this sell down process in 2021 and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out at our Investor Day. Importantly, as we highlighted at Investor Day, incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at $1.8 billion. Turning to Page 8, we made meaningful advancements this year in growing our consumer and wealth management segment, particularly in expanding our customer base, improving [ph] our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise. We remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum and our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities. Our wealth management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.8 billion, as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions. And our private wealth management business this success has long been built on the strength, depth and trust of client relationships, which became even more relevant as COVID-19 limited face-to-face interaction. Throughout this period our private wealth advisors have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and deliver trusted advice. While the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area, we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise. We also continue to expand our high net worth platform through Ayco and personal financial management, our rebranded United Capital business. Our Ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than 30 new corporate clients onto the platform in 2020, as corporates of all types increasingly looked to Ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions. We remain well-positioned to meet this ongoing need given Ayco's broad spectrum of offerings as well as connectivity with our investment banking franchise and our new personal financial management capabilities. We have already begun to see significant synergy as a result of these advantages with over 4000 referrals in 2020 representing over $7 billion of AUS opportunity across these channels. Moving to Page 9, I want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business, which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth. The pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today and The Goldman Sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap. We\u2019ve had early success launching online savings, lending and credit card and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering. We are particularly excited about the launch of Marcus invest platform in the U.S. this quarter, which for the first time brings the investing expertise of Goldman Sachs directly to mass affluent customers. Following our U.S. launch we plan to expand to the UK in the second half of the year. Marcus invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as $1000 in our proprietary asset allocation strategies with options ranging from index funds to ESG focused ETF. Digital investing features will be integrated into the Marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility, simplicity and transparency of Marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities. In addition, our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler, and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered, providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives. As we grow, we will not only serve customers directly through the Marcus platform, but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels. In 2020 we launched four new partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, JetBlue and AARP, while following our first partnership with Apple. We also recently announced a second cobranded credit card with General Motors. Now this is a sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries. Our partners value our scale, innovation, engineering prowess, robust infrastructure, regulatory status, and importantly the power of the Goldman Sachs brand. The opportunities set here is very large, with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases. With that as background, let me also comment on 2020 consumer performance, which exceeded our expectations, but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward. We proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in March as the impact of COVID-19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape. We timed underwriting standards to reduce risk deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and Apple card. Given the economic outlook, we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses. At the same time, we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected, as clients remained attractive to the value of our products and the strength of our brand. Taken together, our pretax loss in consumer, excluding reserve build was reduced versus 2019 levels and lower than our expectations for 2020. Looking forward, we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven excluding reserves for our existing products set, including checking and investing in 2022. That achievement would be one year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by COVID. The 2021 pretax loss for our consumer business, excluding the impact of reserves is likely going to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for 2020. This is driven by lower value on deposits, tighter credit standards, and additionally the investment in our new General Motors credit card. Beyond 2021, we will continue to invest where appropriate, and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank, as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel. In terms of broader functionality, we may look to develop additional products, driving more comprehensive customer experience over time. These investments if pursued may delay our planned breakeven for the business. I want to emphasize, however that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities, it will not affect our ability to meet our enterprise level targets. With respect to partnerships, these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population, and are designed to build on the platform based architecture that we have built for our proprietary markets business. Just as we did with Apple card, our intent is to develop differentiated products and service offerings that are embedded in our partners' ecosystems and tailored for the spending, borrowing and investing needs of their customers. From an economic perspective, these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems. Furthermore, partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for mid-teens returns at scale. Each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms. Goldman Sachs has a history of building businesses with a long-term orientation. Our investment and our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and in the interim, it will not prevent us from reaching our medium term firm wide goals. Before I close, let me share that I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made in 2020, which was a transformative year for Goldman Sachs. Our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do. I am humbled by the level of commitment I see across our organization every day, knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating. As we look forward, I know there will be further challenges, but I am optimistic about the potential for Goldman Sachs in the coming years. I believe in our strategic plan, and our leadership team, and our culture, and in the raw talent of our people. Taken together, these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn it over to Stephen to review funding, expenses and capital as a part of the Investor Day update. Stephen Scherr : Thank you David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made-to-date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium term funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm. As you will recall, our ambition is to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue uplift over the medium term from growth in deposits, enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool. Along with the broader industry, we experienced material shift in the rate environment in 2020. With Fed funds declining over 150 basis points, the relative value of our deposits remained positive, but lower than projected at Investor Day. What's more, since we are modestly asset sensitive as a firm, our assets re-priced more quickly than our liabilities. As 2020 progressed, we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates. While we did not achieve savings in 2020 with greater volume, and now updated pricing in the consumer channel, we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion run rate savings target. We also remain well positioned to capture further savings, as we expand our offerings in markets, deepen our client relationships, and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition. While the focus has been on consumer deposits, our total deposits grew by $70 billion in 2020 across multiple strategic channels, including particularly strong flows in transaction banking. Importantly, deposits comprised approximately 50% of our total unsecured funding base at year end, in line with our medium term target. As the recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts, growth will likely be more moderate in the near term, in light of our entity funding needs. We continue to grow assets within our bank entities, where we have traditionally lagged our peers. We now have approximately one quarter of the firm wide balance sheet, held in the firm's bank entities, versus roughly 15% in 2017. We have also made improvements in our asset liability management that we continue to employ a conservative funding approach focused on term and diversification. Let me now move to Page 11, and expenses. We remain on track to achieve the target laid out at Investor Day of $1.3 billion in expense savings over the medium term, accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year. The achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. Our experience over the past 12 months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan. In particular, we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms, including increased straight-through-processing rates and reduced cost per trade. In addition, we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front-to-back realignment, location strategy and evaluation of pyramid [ph] structure. On the non-compensation front, consolidation of offices in London and Bengaluru [ph] focused on transaction based expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success. The remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy. Last January, we expected that 40% of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations, and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time. We will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe, as well as consolidate our footprint, where appropriate in keeping with our evolving business mix. Now turning to Page 12, and capital. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We seek to deploy capital on accretive terms, both in our incumbent businesses, and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders. While our ratios initially declined in early 2020, as we committed capital to support clients, navigating the pandemic and we received an SCB result in the 2020 CCAR process that was higher than anticipated. Our standardized CET1 ratio at year end was 14.7% accomplished through strong earnings, lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management. Importantly, we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter. As in the past, and as permitted, we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business. We will be dynamic in our approach, both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim CCAR examination. As such, we continue to target the CET1 ratio of 13% to 13.5% over the medium term, which will inform our capital deployment decisions. As we look ahead, we remain engaged with the Federal Reserve to improve stress modeling in CCAR. As David mentioned earlier, we have already sold or announced the sale of $4 billion in assets with $2 billion of related capital reduction. That said, in the first quarter, we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firm's higher SCB based on the results of CCAR 2020. Given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions, the capital attributed to asset management will be larger, and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended sell down of assets. This change will not impact our stated medium term targets, and in fact we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at Investor Day, so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition. Speaking more broadly, there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall. First, our stress capital buffer which we expect to improve as I have noted. Second, our G-SIB surcharge, where we ended the year at 3% to meet client demands, the impact of which will take effect in 2023. And lastly, our management buffer, which we plan to run between 50 and 100 basis points, accounting for volatility and client activity. Before turning to our earnings report, let me finish on Page 13 with a slide that David first presented at Investor Day one year ago. Our strategic direction is guided by these objectives. We are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses, growing our new businesses, and operating the firm more efficiently. Early success in 2020, however, does not diminish our focus on forward execution. We have worked to do from here, and will continue to drive more durable earnings and enhanced returns for our shareholders. In all cases, we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead. With that, let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter, and full year results. First to quickly recap our financial results on Page 1. Fourth quarter net revenues were $11.7 billion, resulting in $44.6 billion for the full year, a growth rate of 22%. In the fourth quarter we delivered net earnings of $4.5 billion and record quarterly earnings per share of $12.8. As David mentioned, the firm delivered full year ROE of 11.1%. Litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly 400 basis points. Turning to Page two and our individual segments. As we noted earlier, Investment Banking delivered outstanding performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter net revenues were $2.6 billion. Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, more than double third quarter levels, reflecting growth in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on over 350 transactions that closed during the quarter, representing over $1 trillion of deal volume, roughly $150 billion ahead of our closest peer. Equity underwriting produced a record $1.1 billion of revenue in the quarter, as industry volumes remained elevated, and we continue to gain market share. This just drove record full year revenues in equity underwriting of $3.4 billion, supported by $115 billion of deal volume across nearly 600 transactions. In an extraordinary year for equity issuance we participated in 120 traditional IPOs, 70 private transactions, and a number of SPAC [ph] IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $526 million down 8% sequentially, reflecting lower investment grade transactions partially offset by strength in leverage finance. Full year revenues of $2.7 billion were a near record and up 26% versus 2019. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number three high yield lead table ranking for the year. Looking forward as David mentioned, our investment banking backlog is at near record levels, significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago. Client dialogues remain robust and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FICC and Healthcare. Fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative $119 million, reflecting roughly $250 million of hedged losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tightened. Recall that for risk management purposes, we maintain single name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments. Of note, in relationship lending, the total notional drawn were funded on revolvers is now back down to pre-COVID levels. Moving to global markets, on Page 3, net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus last year. For the full year global markets generated $21.2 billion of net revenues, up 43% versus 2019, driven by stronger FICC and equities intermediation performance. This represents the highest yearly revenues for this segment in a decade. Turning to FICC on Page 4, fourth quarter FICC net revenues were $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues, where we saw increased client activity, while FICC financing revenues were roughly flat. Three out of five FICC intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business. In credit, we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity, and market share gains, driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading, notably across our digital platforms. In commodities, net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets, including metals and agricultural products. In currencies, net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets, as volatility rose across most currency pairs. In mortgages and rates, net revenues were lower year-on-year, so client activity remained solid, particularly in mortgages around CMBS and mortgage intermediation and in rates activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events, including the U.S. election and COVID and the overall reflationary theme. Moving over to equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up 40% versus a year ago. Full year revenues of $9.6 billion were the highest since 2009. Fourth quarter equities intermediation net revenues of $1.8 billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions, as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading. Equities financing revenues of $591 million were down 19% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, as David mentioned, client balances rose to record levels. Moving to asset management on Page 5, our asset management activities produced net revenues of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, asset management generated net revenues of $8 billion, down from a strong 2019 as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of 2020. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $733 million, up 10% versus a year ago on higher average assets, contributing to record full-year net revenues of $2.8 billion. Across the asset management segment, our AUS stood at a record $1.5 trillion at year end. Our equity investments generated $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on gains on our public and private investments. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated roughly $745 million in gains from investments, including Caspi [ph] and Sprout. And on our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated net gains of approximately $775 million from various positions, substantially all of which were driven by events, including corporate actions, such as fundraisings, capital market activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $250 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $637 million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 6, we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. On equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified, with segment loans largely secured. On Page 7, turning to consumer and wealth management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year net revenues were $6 billion, up 15% versus a year ago, driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth. For the quarter, wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of $1 billion. Full year revenues of $4.8 billion rose 10% year-over-year, and assets under supervision rose to a record $615 billion at year end. Total client assets in this segment exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020. Consumer banking revenues were $347 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year revenues of $1.2 billion, which rose 40% year-over-year, and we're diversified across lending, card and savings. Consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter, despite an additional rate reduction, ending the year at $97 billion across the U.S. and U.K., up $37 billion versus last year. Funded consumer loan balances were $8 billion, of which $4 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $4 billion from credit card lending. Importantly, the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations. The portfolio benefited from improved underwriting, as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plants. Next, let's turn to Page 8, for firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS rose to over $2.1 trillion during the quarter and are up nearly $290 billion versus a year ago. The sequential change was driven by $17 billion of long term inflows, $6 billion of liquidity inflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. On Page 9, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet, particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from credit card balances, and repricing of deposits in consumer and wealth management. Equally, this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our G-SIB surcharge to increase to 3%. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $116 billion, up $4 billion sequentially, largely driven by modest growth in loans and consumer and wealth management and real estate warehouse lending. Our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $293 million, roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago. The quarter\u2019s provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments, offset by some reserve leases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions. Given our announced partnership with General Motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from Capital One, we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of associated provisions in the first quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $103 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.7% and for consumer loans of 15.9%. For the full year, we recognized firm-wide net charge offs of $907 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9% up 30 basis points versus last year. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 65%, which includes a nearly 800 basis point impact from litigation expense. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to compensating top talent. While compensation expenses were up 8% year-over-year relative to growth in revenue net of provisions for credit losses of 17% our full year compensation ratio is at a record low, reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise. As we have said in the past, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses. Our non-compensation expense, our costs for the full year 2020 rose 25% versus last year, excluding litigation or full year operating expenses grew by only 8% inclusive of investments spent across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes. Growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of COVID-19. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 18.7% for the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. We continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21% under the current tax regime. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 11, as previously discussed, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, under the standardized approach up 20 basis points sequentially. Earnings were largely offset by higher RWAs as we stepped in to serve our clients. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 50 basis points to 13.4%. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, rising 3% versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity, particularly within our prime brokerage business. We maintain very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $298 billion, reflecting the current backdrop. On the liability side, our total deposits were roughly flat at $260 billion as planned roll-off of higher costs brokered deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer, private bank and transaction banking deposits. In conclusion, our strong fourth quarter and 2020 results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment. David, John and I are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to furthering our progress on our medium and long term targets and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time.  With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious, on Slide 6 on the Strategic Update, you went back and reminded us of the medium term target of 10% for global markets - 141 in 2020. Obviously 2020 was just kind of repositioning and need for your assistance. But is that just you being conservative on your best guess of normalized trading, like nothing changed there? And I'm just curious in the way capital is being re-shifted towards asset management for private equity, I just didn't know if we should be reading anything more than the obvious into the medium term trading targets. Stephen Scherr : Hey, Glenn its Steven. No, there's nothing more to read. We were just on this slide, reiterating the medium term targets that we had set at 10%. I would point out that well reported ROE in 2020, for global markets was 14.1%. The performance ex-litigation that's otherwise allocated to the segment was 18.1%. I think the other point I would make here is that, as we look forward, and as we've commented several times, impossible to know what 2021 and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented, but I think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business. One, of course, is the expense base is being reduced. The second is we're much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across. But I think perhaps most important, is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients. And David commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share growing by 120 basis points through three quarters, and we'll see what played out for the full year. But I'd also say that a step up in where we stand with the objective of being top three across the top 100 institutional clients and global markets, I think also reflects that we will capture at or better than our share on a going forward basis. Again, acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in 2020 for this business, but the structural changes are important. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Maybe the same kind of concept for the follow up related to investment management. So I get the allocation of more capital, I get the capital that you freed up on the announced sales. I know that when you were initially going down this path, I felt optimistic of your ability to raise lots of third party money and you have. So I wonder if you have a thought process on 2021 or it's just continually marching towards the 150. And then the same, I was concerned about settling down. Private Equity would leave and earnings pick up at some point. But being that you have almost $2 billion in unrecognized incentive fees, do you feel like you can continue down this free up capital sell down private equity raised third party path without a big earnings hiccup. Stephen Scherr : Thanks Schorr. Yes, thanks so much. So let me take both of those first. On fundraising, I think what's gratifying about the progress made in 2020 was a comment David made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with Goldman Sachs. And so, that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in 2020, which will be across a range of different investing sleeves and we'll start to see, that growing number of investing clients look across a range of different product offerings that we have. On the sell down, we're very attentive and have always been, to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon, and we don't anticipate that to happen and we'll continue to manage with that in mind. Now you draw the right observation, which is, there's $1.8 billion of embedded fees to take, which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible and so that will buffer, but the point here is that, our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment. And so we've spoken about $4 billion in balance sheet sales to yield $2 billion of capital relief. We equally have line of sight into another $2.5 billion of sales, which could generate another billion dollars of capital relief. And I'd also point out, though it's not obvious in the way in which the results play, but over the course of the year, we sold $2.1 billion of public equities to offset about $1.9 billion of appreciation in market value and so that equally has capital consequence for us. And so you'll continue to see us move along that road. Finally, on the question or the observation you made about what I was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment, that has no bearing on what our objective is, which is to bring capital down. But as CCAR 2020 was higher, more capital came to the firm, we don't keep a corporate segment. So we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments, by definition, because of its intensity, asset management will pick up more capital. Obviously, on a unit of balance sheet reduction, more capital will come out as we reduce positions, which is why we're confident that we'll maintain at or better than what we're indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe I'll start on Marcus and the digital bank. Thanks for the strategical update there, but stepping back a bit, how do you think your digital banks current and future offerings are stacked up against very successful fintechs like a sci-fi, or a chime? And then just given the very big valuations those companies have gotten, is there a way for you as a management team to better unlock the value of this digital bank for shareholders. David Solomon : So, Christian, I'll start with that. Good morning and thank you for the question. I -- and we tried to highlight this in the update that we're working to go from a product structure, we handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers. And so when you ask about comparison to some of the some of the fintechs, I just say the Fin-techs are much more narrow in scope, in terms of what they offer, and don't have the broad capabilities that we have. And we're betting and we're expanding on for our clients. So just in the context of, the two examples that you gave, and highlighting so fire chime, when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards, when you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans, and you think about savings, and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager, we have a much broader integrated offering and we continue to get feedbacks of the state-of-the-art product platform. And the digital applications that we have, are really excellent by any standards. So we're going to continue to move forward with that long-term strategy. I don't really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses, although I'm watching with everyone else, and I'm looking at what we have, the number of clients we have, the number of customers the size of our business, the scale that we have as we continue to move forward and I am looking at that opportunity, the growth that we have, and if people like those businesses. I think at some point in time, they should, like and value our business, more fulsomely but we'll continue to execute and wait on that. We really like our model of having a proprietary platform for Marcus, but then also, given our corporate relationships, the potential for partnerships is very, very strong for us. And I think you saw that in our execution this year, by adding four more partnerships by capturing the GM Card, and I think you'll continue to see us do more on this front. And so we feel good about it, but as I said in my comments, we're taking a long term view in what we're doing and none of this will affect our medium term targets that we're working toward at the end of 2022, gets a lot of attention, but it won't affect our targets. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. Maybe the question I was asking really around evaluation was, is there something you can do other than spin off, the division of something to get better valuation, better currency to build a business, but I'd hear your points? Maybe my second question apologies, this one is a bit of a nifty question. But I'm trying to understand the impact of interest rates on the Marcus business against the earnings release, he called out higher funding costs and lower yields on the liquidity reserves as a headwind to the Marcus business. But also, in the actual deck, we saw a really big step up in global markets NII quarter-over-quarter. So let me just step back here remind us how interest rates impact the business? What are it\u2019s the current level of interest rates, you look at \u2013 there is the shape of the yield curve, and then some of the liability management actions you've taken? How does that impact the markets business I guess over the coming year? David Solomon : Sure. So NII Christian, as you noted, grew, it was at $1.4 billion for the firm in the quarter. That was driven largely by balance sheet growth, notably in growth markets, and most especially in prime. So our prime balances were up. The challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter, we were slower to adjust, particularly on the retail deposit side pricing of our liabilities and so we didn't capture quite what we wanted. Obviously, we've now brought rates down and so, we're able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business. So liabilities are important. NII expanded because of balance sheet and impact overall net funding costs. And so that's the reference, if you will, to the headwinds notwithstanding prime balance is growing, funding costs were higher than we wanted, that notwithstanding NII grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher G-SIB, in the context of meeting client demands. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Carrier : Good morning, and thanks for the update and taking the question. First, just as we get to moderation in global markets, can you provide some color on what areas of the business and strategic initiatives are best positioned to potentially create some offset overstay like the next one to two years? I think it seems like asset management, could be one of those. Well, some of the initiatives may be further out, but any color on timing of growth away from some, accepted moderation in global markets? David Solomon : Sure, I mean, I think that first, obviously, what we've been speaking about within the asset management business and the growth of third party alternatives and, forward durability of those revenues, is one area. There's obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives, including transaction banking, as well as what we're doing on the consumer side. And so you'll continue to see pickup and share pickup. None of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in global markets. I think within global markets, we will buffer structurally speaking, what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to 2020 by virtue of what we've done around market share gains, and equally, what we're doing around the cost base. And I'd say also, if you look within the global markets business, what we're seeing in terms of the growth in low touch, high volume activity around Marquee and the digital platforms, particularly growth in portfolio trading across, I think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter notwithstanding the market. Finally, I'd point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand. And that too will provide an offset to the extent that again, the assumption to your question that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or global markets business? Michael Carrier : Okay great and then just on the capital side, so given your CET1 ratio of premium above your expected buffer. How are you thinking about either need for the business, either organic or M&A versus capital return? And just your commentary on the asset management business and understanding maybe the models, is that a bit more like how significant could that be longer term as you kind of reposition into that? David Solomon : Sure, so on capital, look, our capital philosophy really remains unchanged, which is we look for opportunities for creative return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting, you know, client demands that are there. Separate from that, it's my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations, which based on the calculation of the Fed will be about $1.9 billion in the quarter plus neutralizing equity based compensation expense. And so we will fulfill that in the first quarter. I'd also repeat a comment I made in the prepared remarks is that we'll continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward. Obviously, that's not a first quarter proposition, given the Fed rules, but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them. In terms of asset management, this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business. It is being mindful of revenue in the near term. It is driving down on balance sheet investing, and moving that into third party activity, doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm. And I think that will, continue to take down our capital. And I suspect based on the progress we made in 2020, of taking 2 billion on 4 billion of sales. And as I mentioned, our forward view on what's, within line of sight, incremental capital will come out, at or better than the expectations we carried at the Investor Day itself. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning everyone. So I wanted to start off with a question on the trading business. Now your share gains and trading for 2020 were quite impressive and likely represent the strongest gains across the entire global IB cohort. And historically, you've been the dealer of choice for clients during periods of macro stress, given your risk and your mediation expertise and those client needs will be magnified this year due to COVID. Raising questions as to why they're the share gains will be sustainable as those client needs moderate. And I was hoping you can give some perspective on what gives you confidence that you could sustain the recent share gains in global markets as activity normalizes and any differences you're seeing across high versus low touch might be very helpful. David Solomon : Okay, thanks. Thanks, Steve, I'll start. And I appreciate the question. And I'll just, to take your framing, you said historically, at times of severe stress, you've been a dealer of choice. And you really -- you make that statement by going back and looking at one window, which was the financial crisis, and there's no question in the financial crisis, we had very, very significant share gains. But I would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set, were in a position of very, very weak, structural financial performance, at the time, and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients. So one of the things I recall hearing at that time, is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis. And we benefited from that. I think, hopefully, we benefited for other reasons. But there was a different component. We have a very, very different situation right now. Banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic. All of our competitors have showed up in spades and yet we have very, very significant share gains. Now, maybe some of that is a branded reputation that were a dealer of choice during the pandemic, but I would argue a bigger impact in really affecting how we perform and I've heard this consistently from our global markets clients, is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years, in terms of how we're facing clients, or one GS approach and what we're trying to do. We talked a little bit in the strategic update and talking about how for the first time over the last couple of years, we have a targeted approach, and evaluating our wallet share with the top 100 clients, seems relatively straightforward. But this is not something we had ever done historically. And that we advanced that considerably over the course of 2020, by going from top-three with 51 of the clients to top three of 64 of the clients. We have a much more client centric approach. I got a lot of feedback calls this year from our clients, noticing what they said was a very different approach in the way Goldman Sachs interacted with them now then versus 10 years ago. And so I would argue across the platform, that orientation is helping a while share [Ph] gains. Now, I'm not going to sit here and say that in a different environment, when the world is more even, and we're not in a crisis, that there's not going to be a flattening. In fact, I'd say that across all our businesses. We tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress, and the market share gains collapse a little bit in times when everything is very, very easy. And so I'm sure there'll be some of that. But we have a very, very clear strategy, or a very clear client centric strategy that is different. And I think it's led to enhanced wallet share gains. I'd also say and we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business. This goes back to one of the earlier questions, we've made structural improvements, not just in the client approach, but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business. And the results are even if we have a different available client wallet, we have a structurally more profitable business on a go forward basis. And so that's the way we're thinking about that. I hope that's helpful. Stephen Scherr : The one of the thing I would add to the part of your question you asked about kind of high touch and low touch, which is, if you look at our credit business in FIC, over Q2, Q3 and Q4, what's interesting is in Q2 and Q3, you saw amidst very high volatility, a lot of the sort of bespoke idiosyncratic, block like activity that we've long been known for. What's interesting is, if you look at Q4, we started to see very high portfolio trading going on, rebalancing among asset managers, pension funds, a lot of that going on across our digital platforms. I'd just offer you that Q2, Q3 and then Q4, as a reflection of kind of a more, a broader, more robust business, that's better equipped, better capabled, better positioned to capture what we've long been known to do, as we did in the second and third quarter. And some of the more technology driven, platform driven, trading, that is newer, and quite sticky in the context of what we can keep. Steven Chubak : Yes. It's really interesting color. I appreciate the perspective from both of you. And just for my follow up on efficiency, you spoke with your continued efforts to evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings and was hoping you could just give some perspective on what some of those opportunities might be and especially as we think about the need to potentially flex in a tougher macro backdrop. And just one clarifying point is the 650 million of savings. Should we be thinking about the savings already captured versus the 4Q \u201820 baseline? Or is that versus the full year 20 expense base? David Solomon : I'll start on that. I'll let Stephen answer the second point about the second point with respect to the 650. But I just what, Steven, I think the way you should understand that we're thinking about this is we've been re-underwriting the firm, and trying to do what we can across the platform to operate more efficiently. We set out a target on or Invest Day. And we had a very clear view on the path to that target. When we said that a year ago at our Investor Day, and we're marching through and we're executing on that. With respect to other opportunities, we continue to evaluate other opportunities. And it would be hard pressed to say that we didn't learn a lot this year in the context of the operating environment, that we've looked that we've been operating this year. And so that's giving us new insights into other places across the platform where things can be more efficient. In addition, our business like lots of businesses is digitizing. And in the context of that it's allowing us to digitize processes that historically we've used, we've executed with more manual, personnel sort to speak. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We do think there are other opportunities, when we have more to say to be more specific, with our continued focus on transparency will give you more specifics. Stephen Scherr : Yes, to the first part of your question, achieving $1.3 billion was annualized savings. So we would realize these savings each and every year. And this was as against kind of entry level expenses, meaning entering into 2020 when we announced them at Investor Day, but this is achieving a $1.3 billion annual run rate savings of which about half has been achieved. The only other thing I would add, on the forward is obviously COVID has accelerated our own thinking about moving populations and taking aggregations of people into different areas and so I think, you know, we feel more assured and confident at our ability to do that, the pace of it, and you'll continue to see that play forward in the achievement is the 1.3 or beyond. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Jeffery Harte : Good morning. Sorry about that. David Solomon : Hey, Jeff. I am coming through now? Jeffery Harte : Yes, fine. Hey how are you thinking about the cyclical outlook for capital markets activity levels broadly? I guess I come from there's a belief out there that the strength in 2020 was really just a stimulus driven anomaly and maybe we're headed back to 2019 levels. But when I look at historical cyclicality and activity level indicators, it suggests potential staying sustainability if not continued growth. I mean, how are you thinking about that as we move into 2021 and 2022? David Solomon : Well, it's, I'll take this at a high level, Jeff. Obviously, it's hard to when I wouldn't speculate, going out for multiple years, but what I would say is we're still in the middle of a pandemic, there's still an enormous amount of stimulus. And there's also because of the acceleration of digital trends, there are lots of businesses and lots of CEOs that are rethinking or re underwriting strategically how they're positioned. So corporate activity, and therefore capital markets activity in that context is high. Certainly, as we head into 2021, there are a lot of indicators, that that's going to continue in 2021, certainly in the near term. And so our expectation is, certainly in the near term, that activity will continue. To the degree that we get to a more normalized environment, the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity to the degree over time, there's a more normalization of monetary policy, that obviously can affect this activity level. But that's not something we'd expect in the near term and 2021. So at the moment, pipeline backlogs, things that we can see, continue to look robust. That doesn't mean that we're saying that we expect to repeat of everything we saw in 2020. And there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the Marcus business that I think were elevated in 2020. And our expectations for 2021 are not as robust as they weren't 2020, but certainly more robust than they were in 2019. Jeffery Harte : Okay, and thank you. Secondly, as you continue to grow deposits, are you facing limits on your ability to deploy the incremental deposit growth? I guess, when I look at your balance sheet, I see deposit investable, earning asset growth is more of a pressing need the additional deposit growth? Stephen Scherr : Yes, I mean, I think that, on the forward, you should expect a more moderated level of growth in deposits. As we pull more and more assets into the bank. I think, as I noted in the remarks, we've moved from 15% of assets in the banks to 25%, but importantly, on incremental asset movement, 90% of the lending that's going on, in and around the firm is being booked in bank entities that will consume deposit funding that goes on in the bank entities themselves. I'd also point out that when we speak about bank entities, we're not only speaking about our U.S. Bank, but equally the U.K. and our bank, in Continental Europe, in Germany, all of which have slightly different requirements in terms of the deployment of that funding, but the incremental asset flow is going into the bank, and you're going to start to see continued growth from 25% of the overall firm. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Stephen Scherr : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. Question on the expense side, just a two part; one, on the comp and the comp ratio. We did say the comp ratio come down on a full year basis, roughly 400 basis points year-on-year. And I'm just wondering, is that really a function of non-compensatable revenues that that shot up significantly year-on-year or this reflects the comments you were making earlier about moving people to the strategic locations, it feels like a lot in one year. So just trying to unpack the major drivers and how we should see that, how we should expect that flexes going forward? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think the, the abiding observation here is that there is considerable leverage in the business. That is when we'd grow revenue top line by 22% or grow at 17% net of provision for credit loss, you see our comp and benefit line rise by 8%. So there's embedded leverage in this business. I think, as we've also said in the past, and this is reflected a little bit in your question, the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this, in part, because the profile of the business will change. That is, as we grow up, businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business, they will be less comp heavy in terms of overall expense and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant. But I think, for where we are right now, there's considerable leverage in this where we're capable of rewarding our talent for performance overall, but equally doing that on a levered basis, so that our shareholders and shareholders benefit more broadly from the overall performance. Betsy Graseck : And could we just get a sense on the tech budget that you've got right now and how you're thinking about that size and growth over the next, year or so? Stephen Scherr : Yes, I think the tech budget is going to continue to grow. It will grow by several $100 million dollars year-over-year. It will do that really for two reasons; one, continued improvement at the core, that is the way in which the firm operates more broadly. It is achievement of some of what David was talking about around automation and the like. And then separately, it will be focused on particular initiatives, like transaction banking, like the consumer business, and so forth. And I think part of, our focus on the efficiencies that we're capable, and the cost savings we're capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm. And so you'll continue to see that investment play out. We have less remedial activity than perhaps some of the other bigger commercial banks have and as much as we have a lot of new tech build and new activity going on. But we're going to continue to look to harvest cost savings to substantially offset the impact of that increased investment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, could you get more color on your backlog? You said, it's near record, its update quarter-over-quarter and specifically as it relates to SPACs, how much have SPACs contributed to revenues in 2020 and what's the multiplier effect? I understand it's linked with mergers and leveraged finance, where your top three are number one, just for more color in SPACs and how it relates to the backlog and what that's been contributing and how sustainable that is? David Solomon : Sure. So, a couple of comments. Backlog levels, as we stated, are up quarter-over-quarter. And I'd say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up. Certainly SPAC activities contributing to it. But strategic corporate M&A is up meaningfully. And what I say is that was a real kind of doldrums as the pandemic hit, and people were reorganizing, but as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel, and get a sense of where things were going. Strategic activity, with corporates really picked up and that's contributed, meaningfully also and that has nothing really to do with the SPAC ecosystem. On SPACs Mike, I'll say a couple of things. And there's no question that, the growth of SPACs as a product that definitely affected activity levels. But there are a few things that I'd say, just to try to frame it. SPACs were a little bit more than 50% of IPO activity this year. But when you look at IPO activity, IPO activity for us, for example, was on a volume basis, about 17% of our equity volume. So we did about $20 billion of IPO lead table against $115 billion of equity lead table, 17%. If you look at our IPO fees, all IPOs, SPAC and non-SPAC, and again, SPACs was say around 50%. But if you look at our IPO fees, our IPO fees were less than 40% of all our equity underwriting fees and then SPACs would be a subset of that. Now to your point, it also creates an ecosystem around capital rising around advisory services, et cetera. And so there's no question that that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities. So a couple of other things I'd say, first, we generally strive to be number one in the lead tables. We do not strive to be number one, in the SPAC lead tables, we are very well, we're very active, we're very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on. And just looking at last year, if you look at the number of SPACs that were done and the lead table leaders, the number one and number two firms did about 33% more deals than we did, representatives, I think of some of the things that came to us that we turned away. So we're participating, but we're trying to participate. But picking what we think are the best situations, I do think SPACs is a good use case, versus a traditional IPO, and advantages for sellers and for investors and looking at this ecosystem. But the ecosystem is not without flaws. I think it's still evolving. I think the incentive system is still evolving. One of the things we're watching very, very closely is the incentives of the sponsors, and also the incentives of somebody that selling. And while I think these activity levels continue to be very robust, and that they do continue as we head into 2021 continue to be very, very robust. I do not think this is sustainable in the medium term. And there'll be something that will, in some way, shape or form, bring the activity levels down over a period of time. But we're watching it closely. And it's something that our clients continue to be very, very interested in. There are lots of companies that go public via SPAC that could also go public and a traditional IPO. And there's some companies that go public and a SPAC that probably couldn't go public through the standardized process of a traditional IPO. And all of those are things that the market will have to less with. And one of the things I certainly think is the case is you have something here it's a good capital markets innovation. But like many innovations, there's a point in time as they start, where they have a tendency, maybe to go a little bit too far, and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way. And that's something my guess is we'll see over the course of 2021 or 2022, with SPACs. Mike Mayo : And then one more a general question, David. So I think what I hear you say on this call is that it's not a forecast, but kind of your expectation for capital markets for this year might be a little bit less than, last year, but it should still be better than 2019 or something like that. We had a decade long reduction in wallet share in the markets business. Do you think that decade long reduction, considering it normalized last year, do you think that's reversing? Some people say it is some people say it won't? David Solomon : So, two points, I think, Mike to the questions if I got it right. With, I'm not going to speculate on a forecast on a specific forecast around capital markets activity. But I do think your statement is fair in terms of the way I framed it, which is capital markets activity is starting \u201821 very robust. Based on the data we have, it seems like it will continue to be relatively robust in 2021. But we don't expect it to be at the same level that it was in 2020. With respect to your second question, I assume you're asking about global markets wallet share. Were you asking about banking and markets wallet share? Mike? Operator : One moment, let me open Mike\u2019s line. David Solomon : Mike? Mike Mayo : Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, trading is decade? Yes. David Solomon : Global market you're talking about? Mike Mayo : Correct. David Solomon : Okay. So I talked earlier on the call, about the way over the last two and a half years, we've evolved our strategy. And I think the strategy we have for our global markets business is a good strategy for Goldman Sachs. I like our position, and we've consolidated share. Why have we done that? We've done that because we have a very client centric approach, a very holistic one Goldman Sachs approach. We have a much more targeted wallet share approach through the largest institutional clients that we interact within that business and that has allowed us to strengthen our position. And so, I can't go back and make all the direct comparisons that everybody wants, but I think there are a lot of things. And I stated some of this earlier that are very different about what we saw coming out of the financial crisis and what evolved versus where we're operating today. So the wallet may change, but I think we've made material strides and strengthened our position in global markets, and I expect us to hold a number of those wallet share gains and we're very, very focused on making sure we do. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. So first is on the investments that you're making on the consumer side, there's regular speculation in the press around, maybe what you might be considering on the M&A front and actually, the speculation has centered on consumer banking. And so, could you help is the indication and the idea that you guys are interested in investing in that business and, pushing that impacting some of the targets, a, sort of a clear indication that you're really interested in building rather than buying. And, as I sit here, I just kind of wonder, okay, why would these guys want to invest so much, if they had, if there was something large that they were looking to do, in anything remotely close to the near term? Just curious, your thoughts on that, whether that's too big a leap? David Solomon : Well, there's a lot there in what you said, Brennan, but I'm going to repeat something that I've said over and over again. We're focused on building an integrated digital platform in the consumer space, I think over the last four plus years, we're off to a very good start, we've given you lots of metrics, we can track that progress. And we continue to roll out on the investments that we're making, including, as we said, you'll see invest this quarter, Marcus invest this quarter, and you'll see checking during the course of the year. With respect to M&A opportunities broadly, whether it's to expand our consumer offering, whether it's the grower asset management business, whether it's to expand our wealth management capability, we're always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans, if something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan. And we thought that it was a good fit strategically, and we thought, we could acquire it and integrate it attractively, then we would do it, just as we did with United Capital, but the bar to do something significant is extremely high. And it's not an easy thing to do. So, we'll continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan. But we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. And I think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale, that are accretive to Goldman Sachs's return, even if we do not do something significant and organically. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for that. And then my second one is on the efficiencies and I know there have been a few questions there. But, from my perspective, it's, I guess it's just a little bit hard to unpack some and see some of the 650 that you referenced earlier, Steven. You guys have a lot of revenue and volume sensitivity on your expense side. And that's, usually particularly true on the comp front. So, maybe how much of the 650 was in non-comp versus comp? And, what is your expectation for the timing on the remaining 650? Any color that you can kind of give. Stephen Scherr : Yeah. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on non-comp expense in the year. So, our non-comp was up 8% ex-litigation of about $900 million of non-comp expense increase year-over-year, about two thirds in excess of $600 million was variable expense, BC&E, all of which is related to the volume of activity that's coming through. And so, I just framed that just so you have a sense of how, non-comp framed out over the course of the year. Now, if you look at our achievement of about half of the 1.3 billion of run rate efficiencies that we've set as a target for ourselves, I would say up through the end of 2020, a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side, okay, relative to non-comp. So by that, I mean, we've undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of 2020 at spans and layers, meaning we've looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of, of parts of the organization. We've looked at scope of management, and we've been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard. We engaged in a front to back exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view, in line of sight of the people in the business, who know and understand what their objectives are and where they're going. Third is we've looked at at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that. And so that's on the sort of compensation side. On the non-compensation side, I would say that we've done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like London and in Bangalore, harvesting significant savings there, we've moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool. We've looked to centralize our expense management through SAP taking multiple platforms and bulling them into one, we've looked to centralize our expense management, through SAP, taking multiple platforms, and pulling them into one, all of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about 50% of the 1.3 billion, and frankly speaking, give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward, perhaps in excess of it. And so that may be a bit more granular than you want, but just to lay out sort of the elements, right, of where these expenses are being harvested. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. David, you've been very clear about the difference in your success in this stress period versus 2008 and 2009. And we all know, the consolidation of the broker dealer community over the last 25 years has been dramatic. Can you address your success based on economies of scale, and how -- I know you've done a very good job on the customer centric focus that you've talked about already. But how important is the economies of scale today, versus maybe five or 10 years ago? And is that an advantage that you and some of your peers have over the smaller broker dealers? David Solomon : Yes. So Gerard, I think it's a good question. I appreciate it. And I think there's a huge advantage. And so, putting aside some of the things I'm talking about, that are strategically based on our conscious decisions, we happen to be, one of the handful of firms that is global at scale on a market leader, in these global markets and investment banking businesses, and I think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses, unless you're global and at scale, unless you have the capacity to make very, very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients. And so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms. And we continue to be one of those players. And I think that position has only grown and then been strengthened. I also would point out that we don't just have scale broadly, we've stayed committed, as I highlighted earlier in my remarks to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business. So you think about the many asset classes across markets, we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities, and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients. And there was a real benefit to that this year. So, I think there's no question, the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage. I think to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins, given the capital requirements, the technology requirements, the regulatory requirements, being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was 15, 20, 25 years ago. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just quickly, Stephen, on the capital position, and when the Federal Reserve releases all the banks from the limitations on share repurchases based on the income equation they have given you guys, would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program, once everybody's released from that limitation? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think, the manner and form of our execution sort of will decide and you know, proceed forward. What I would reiterate is that, right now the Fed is not quite at the SCB regime that had been laid out initially. Remember, SCB was meant to put banks in a position. All banks, if you're above your minimum, you can go about share repurchase, dividend, et cetera. We're not there yet, the Fed has limited what we can do on repurchase. As I spoke about earlier, we will execute to the capacity that we have to repurchase in the first quarter. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the mechanism by which we will do it. But certainly, safe to rely on the fact that we'll look to use our capacity and proceed from there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. Just two questions here. First, may be just clarification on the provision that you mentioned from the credit card relationship, I think it was $200 million attributed to that is when I show that a gross number or are you saying that the provision expense in the first quarter is 200 million on a net basis? Stephen Scherr : Sure, so just to be clear in connection with the back book that we're acquiring relative to the GM partnership, we anticipate taking approximately $200 million of provisions in the first quarter. So to be clear, it's not reflected in 2020. I'm just giving you and the market sort of an indication of what that will be occasioned by the acquisition of that backlog. And that's an accounting, rule and requirements that we are adhering to. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then also as it relates to the reserve, I mean, given what, expectations for economic conditions from here, I mean, when do you expect kind of the more reserved, the leases are larger, I guess, reserve releases on a go forward basis? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So again, in the fourth quarter, we're taking provision for credit loss of 293 million, I will tell you that embedded in that is a release of about $200 million, occasioned by better macroeconomic observations and adjusting the model and reserve release. That release though was offset in the context of incremental provisions either occasioned by impairments or growth in the overall portfolio. So it's not to reflect anything negative or a negative comment on the state of our performance of the portfolio, but rather growth in it across the whole of the firm. I would say as an aside, we continue to see our consumer portfolio performed better from a credit perspective than even what we had anticipated coming into the crisis. But embedded in the provision is release that release offset by growth and by impairments. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. You seem to be progressing pretty well toward your targets. But I think whether you look at consensus expectations or talk to investors, there seems to be some skepticism around you hitting, the 14% ROTE, the 60% efficiency ratio in 2022. I mean, I think that reflects some uncertainty around the trajectory of trading in IB. But, maybe we can take a step back and just ask it this way, I guess, what kind of growth were you assuming in those kind of more volatile revenue streams? It doesn't seem like initially, it was a lot of growth expected from 2019 levels. But I guess maybe asking the question this way, do you still feel comfortable hitting those targets in 2022 with revenues in sort of trading and investment banking similar to \u201819 or does it have to be materially higher? Stephen Scherr : So remember, on the efficiency ratio, and obviously, it's implied by your question, there's revenue and there's an expense component to it. On the revenue side, we saw more growth in 2020, than had been anticipated. But we nonetheless expect levels of growth consistent with what we anticipated at our Investor Day. And I'd also point out that we continue to work on the expense side, as we've spoken about in relation to a number of questions on this call, and there continues to be leverage in the business to the extent that revenue growth doesn't materialize. As we expected, we've got levers to pull on expense, which is why we are comfortable, with a view that will achieve an efficiency ratio at around 60% by 2022. Obviously, we were better than that X litigation in 2020. There will be variability to it. But, there are levers to pull as and to the extent that the growth doesn't play, but we're assuming that it will. And it it's not entirely reliant on global markets. James Mitchell : Right. I think the assumption was very minimal growth in sort of those core businesses, excluding some of the investments. Is that fair? Stephen Scherr : Yes, I think that's fair. David Solomon : That's fair. James Mitchell : All right. Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you and thanks for the strategy update. You've talked a bit about growth, in the previous question, some of the earlier ones. But growth, I'm thinking of the organic build in some of your new businesses, the transaction bank and the consumer businesses. I wondered if you could put those in the context of the evolving environment that faces us in 2021 with still some areas of stress continuing, but some areas of recovery, which are those new businesses, do you see accelerating the growth or slowing or changing the game plan of how you proceed? David Solomon : Well, it's interesting, I mean, I think that we should take them each on their own. In transaction banking, I think what we have hit is a resonating chord with our clients about the nature of what we've built, meaning we've built a new and improved digital Interface by which corporations can manage their operational flows. And that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there. I say that not as just simply an observer, but also a consumer of that service, where Goldman Sachs is using its own platform. And I think that will continue, in part because operational flows across corporate\u2019s will continue, almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement. Overall, the consumer side may be a different proposition. Now, it depends on the perspective you take with respect to, GDP growth, and what happens with rates and the like. But I think, as David has said, on the consumer side, we are playing for the long term, that is building relationship with 10s of millions of consumers and pivoting in 2021, to a broader, more comprehensive platform that I think will attract more consumers to the platform, not simply because there's an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending, but because we'll offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking, and will become a more reliable primary bank, to more consumers. And I think that'll play out again, kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital markets intensive activity. Jeremy Sigee : And just a follow up in a different area. In the global markets business, we've talked a lot on the call about the outlook for volumes and for volatility. But it feels like one of the elements of strength this past year has been wider bid offer spreads. I wondered if you could sort of comment, you agree with that observation that's been a contributing factor to the strength? And how you see that evolving? Do you think we see a return of pressure on trading profitability as we go forward? Stephen Scherr : So I'm going to go back to a response I made to one of the questions earlier, which is, Q2 and Q3 look different than Q4, we experienced and benefited from wider bid offer during the intensity of what played out in Q2 and Q3 and the fact as David has mentioned now several times that we stayed the game and showed up across a range of asset classes helped us and we benefited from that. There's no question that has moved to the back of the year in Q4, you saw compression from what was wide in Q2 and Q3. But there again, wallet share gains benefited us, and equally, playing to both high touch and low touch. And so the advent of what we were doing through marquee, and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit. So tighter bid offer there as opposed to wider bid offer in Q2. But I think you're seeing a business that is more diverse, broader and in a position to continue to intermediate flows and do so with very high balance sheet velocity. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions, please continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : Since there are no more questions, we'd like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call on behalf of the senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months and if there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team, otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Carey most recently served as the firm\u2019s Deputy Treasurer and CEO of GS Bank USA and began her career in credit risk as a bank analyst. She brings 22 years experience at Goldman Sachs to her new role. As I leave this seat to assume the role of COO of our asset management business, I want to extend my sincere appreciation to each of you for your partnership over the years. On the call today, David will start with a high level review of our first quarter performance and our client franchise. He will also provide an update on the operating environment and macroeconomic backdrop. Stephen will then discuss our first quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call to David. David? David Solomon : Thanks, Heather, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before I begin my remarks, let me thank Heather for leading the firm\u2019s Investor Relations effort for the past four years and welcome Carey to the role. I will begin on page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the first quarter, we produced record net revenues of $17.7 billion. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of $6.8 billion, record quarterly earnings per share of $18.60, and a return on equity of 31% and a return on tangible equity of 32.9% the highest in over a decade. Our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment which we operated during the quarter. These results also evidenced our successful execution towards the firm\u2019s strategic priorities. We maintained our leading global positions across M&A and equity underwriting. We delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade with strength in FICC and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last year\u2019s market share gains. In asset management, we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions, and we continued to harvest on-balance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more third-party assets, where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies. In Wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra-high net worth PWM clients, while we further scale our personal financial management business. And in Consumer, we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform. This quarter, we launched Marcus Invest in the U.S., our digital investment offering, which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a $1,000 investment. The customer response and uptake since launch has been positive and we are focused on scaling the platform. We\u2019re also working towards the launch of digital checking in the U.S. and Marcus Invest in the UK. Importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop. With that, let me turn now to the operating environment on page 2. As anticipated, we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter, which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world. At this stage, it is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-COVID levels. This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets with U.S. equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent U.S. employment data and our economists\u2019 forecast on GDP growth. Despite these positive developments, we recognized that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around COVID-19. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the U.S. and the UK, distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe, and the prospect of new variants add to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery. As you would expect, we remain vigilant to risks across markets. We are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes, increased volatility in certain single name stocks, and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy. Let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics while I\u2019ve been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders. First, on the events related to Archegos Capital, this was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions. This is not the first time we\u2019ve seen a situation like this, and it likely won\u2019t be the last. We have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios. Our risk controls, all of which were put in place long before the March events, worked well. We identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client. I am pleased with how the firm handled it, and And it\u2019s a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across Goldman Sachs, both in the business and on the control side of our firm. These events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency. They are worthy of debate, and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialog. Next on SPACs, we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation that\u2019s here to stay. However, as a meaningful participant in this market, we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite, with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors, sponsor economics, investor protections, and disclosure. We believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets. I also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the digitization of money. As activities in these areas progress, there will be a significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world. Many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to their local markets and determine the longer term impact on global payment systems. There\u2019s also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value. At Goldman Sachs, we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our client needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency. Of course, we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines. For example, we cannot own Bitcoin or trade it as principal. Goldman Sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems. Another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability. We remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance. Central to our purpose as an organization, our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders. During the quarter, we issued our first sustainability bond, where we raised $800 million, the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth. We also launched One Million Black Women, an initiative that I\u2019m very proud of and through which the firm will commit $10 billion of direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital for capacity building grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the United States. Separately, we also committed an additional $500 million to \u2018Launch With GS\u2019, our program designed to invest in diversified companies and fund managers, bringing our total commitments to $1 billion. Finally, I want to take a few minutes to comment on our people. I continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators. The firm\u2019s quarterly results are product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of Goldman Sachs, day in and day out. Notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, our people have rallied to the needs of our clients. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world. I am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work, dedication and our culture of teamwork. It will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy. We have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization. Many will spend their entire career with us. Some will even become clients of the firm. This is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades. It is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy where we\u2019re working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational. I recognize there\u2019s an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post pandemic. For Goldman Sachs, our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us. We have found the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis. Let me be clear, achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage the personal and professional lives, which is the way we have always run this firm. And given the experience of the past year, I\u2019m more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward. Over the course of the past few months, we\u2019ve been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate. We have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in the return. Importantly, I look forward to increasing number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand, and we welcome new joiners to the firm\u2019s offices this summer. Regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients, and at times have been overburdened, I\u2019ve been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career. As you can now see from our results, client activity is extraordinarily high. And I fully appreciate how busy our people have been. This has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in COVID-19 environment. To address this, we are taking concrete actions including additional hiring, reallocating resources, and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries. In this 24x7 connected world, we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that Goldman Sachs is the place we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and wellbeing. In closing, I\u2019m very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders. I\u2019m confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on page 3. During the first quarter, the firm\u2019s performance reflected meaningful strength across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active in raising capital, particularly in the equity markets, and we witnessed high levels of M&A activity amid elevated strategic dialogues. In global markets, we saw strength across all products and regions, as client engagement remained high. In asset management record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments, particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market. We also saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year in our consumer and wealth management segment for the third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering. Turning to specific business performance on page 4, let me begin with investment banking. Investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of $3.8 billion up 73% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $1.1 billion rose 43% versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter. During the quarter, we maintained our number one league table position as we participated in over $400 billion of announced transactions, over $100 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, and closed over 100 deals for approximately $300 billion of deal volume. The bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting, where we generated a record $1.6 billion in revenues over 4 times greater than the levels the year ago. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting with our volumes climbing to nearly $50 billion across roughly 240 deals, including over 90 initial public offerings, for companies across all markets like Coupang in Korea, InPost in Poland, and Bumble in the U.S. Our equity underwriting market share increased more than 60 basis points during the quarter, largely driven by improved share in IPOs. We experienced strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in a growing number of SPAC transactions. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $880 million, up 51% from a year ago, driven by strong activity levels, particularly in leveraged finance and asset-backed transactions. In addition, our engagement with sectors impacted by COVID, including airlines and hospitality was high. Notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in a quarter, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Revenues from corporate lending were $205 million, down 54% versus the first quarter of last year, which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book. Revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income including from transaction banking and fees from relationships lending, partially offset by approximately $85 million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly. Moving to global markets on page 5. Our franchise exhibited broad-based strength across businesses in both FICC and equities. Net revenues were $7.6 billion in the first quarter, up 47% versus a year ago, and the highest since 2010. During the quarter, we benefited from a supportive market-making environment and facilitated considerable client activity. Turning to FICC on page 6. First quarter net revenues were $3.9 billion, up 31% versus a year ago, driven by a 36% increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management, and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year. In mortgages, revenues rose significantly, bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing. In commodities, higher year-on-year performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows. In rates, revenues rose amid strong risk management and client engagement, particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the U.S. and diverging central bank actions, during the quarter. In credit, revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads, while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance. We also saw increasing volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading. In currencies, revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago, though client engagement remained high across both the G-10 and emerging markets franchises. Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, up 68% versus a year ago, as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 69%, reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives, as well as strong risk management. In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels, and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter. In derivatives, we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structure transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion were the best in over a decade, rising 65% year-over-year. Average balances in our prime business grew to record levels, as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter. As we continue to grow our prime business, we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources including liquidity that are consumed. While we avoided losses related to recent events involving Archegos Capital, as David noted, the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems. As to forward expectations for global markets, it remains difficult to predict client activity. While we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year, we believe the high levels of primary issuance, the current trajectory of economic recovery, and diverging central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets, could continue to support elevated client activity. Our confidence on the foreword of global markets rests largely on the market share gains, generated last year through a deepening of client relationships, and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies. As we\u2019ve noted previously, this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business, independent of the wallet opportunity. Moving now to asset management on page seven. In the first quarter, we generated record revenues of $4.6 billion. Management and other fees totaled $693 million, up 8% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds. Incentive fees of $42 million were lower versus a strong year ago quarter. Equity investments produced $3.1 billion of net gains, including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to event-driven activity in our private equity portfolio, such as sales or capital raises. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $340 million. This quarter, we disposed of over $1.5 billion of positions, given attractive market conditions. Despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter, the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of IPOs in our private portfolio and market appreciation. Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of nearly $2.6 billion from various positions, more than two thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $225 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. We announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of $1.5 billion in the quarter, bringing the total private sales since our 2020 Investor Day to $4.7 billion. There is an implied $2.3 billion of capital associated with those assets. Additionally, we have line of sight on nearly $3 billion of incremental asset sales. Despite these actions, and as I mentioned on our January earnings call, we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our 2020 CCAR stress test. This change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology, which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration. On the forward, a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital, consistent with what we presented at our 2020 Investor Day to below $18 billion by 2024. The ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to third-party versus on-balance sheet investing, and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales. We are keen to continue such activity as it would be capital accretive to the firm. That said, dispositions at attractive levels now, will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters. We are mindful of that trade-off and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested. Finally, in asset management, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $759 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. Let me now turn to page 8, where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we\u2019ve provided to you in prior quarters. Our equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage, and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with loans in the segment largely secured. Moving to page 9, consumer and wealth management produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 16% versus a year ago. Management and other fees of $1.1 billion rose 12% versus last year, reflecting higher assets under supervision, which rose 25% to $637 billion. Consumer banking revenues grew to $371 million in the first quarter, up 32% versus last year, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth. Next, let\u2019s turn to page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision, and firm-wide management and other fees. Total AUS increase to a record $2.2 trillion during the quarter, up over $380 billion versus a year ago. The sequential increase of $59 billion was driven by $37 billion of long-term inflows and $23 billion of liquidity inflows. Our total firm-wide management and other fees grew by 11% versus the first quarter of 2020 to $1.8 billion. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, higher versus year-ago, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets and lower funding costs. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $121 billion, up $5 billion sequentially, driven by residential real estate warehouse and wealth management lending. In the first quarter, provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $70 million. This includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations, partially offset by portfolio growth, including approximately $180 million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with General Motors expected to launch by year-end. Next, let\u2019s turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $9.4 billion. While our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to 34% from 41% in the first quarter of last year, compensation expense increased, reflecting strong performance. Non-compensation expenses were up only 5% versus last year, as increase in transaction-based and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation, and travel and entertainment expenses, as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities. Overall, our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53.3%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. We remain focused on our expense discipline in a pay for performance culture, as well as our expense initiatives where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, primarily reflecting the impact of equity-based compensation of approximately $175 million. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%. I should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our capital levels on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 40 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by increased lending and higher market RWAs as we stepped into serve clients, partially offset by strong earnings. In the quarter, we returned a total of $3.15 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2.7 billion and approximately $450 million in common stock dividends. Our book value per share rose to a record $250.81. While the Federal Reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases, we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter, close to the levels of the first quarter. And we\u2019ll evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, 12% higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets, averaging nearly $300 billion. On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $286 billion up $26 billion versus last quarter. Notably consumer deposits surpassed $100 billion during the quarter.  Our long-term debt rose by $6 billion, driven by $20 billion of benchmark issuance, given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities, particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business, we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience, more durable revenues, and strong returns for shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. I appreciate your comments on the capital freed up on the equity investment sales. The question I have is -- I don\u2019t remember every number, but it looks like some of those sales or a lot of those sales came from the older vintages, which is good, I think. But now, with most of the book or all the book six years or younger, does that slow the monetization process? I know you mentioned you had line of sight on $3 billion more. Maybe you could talk about how much capital would be associated with that $3 billion, and maybe how the pipeline looks for third-party capital raise for the remainder of the year? Stephen Scherr : Sure, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So, let me just go through the numbers, so we\u2019re all level set. In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, since our Investor Day, we\u2019ve disposed of balance sheet positions totaling $4.7 billion that produced about $2.3 billion of relief as well. In terms of line of sight, as I said, we have a view into about $3 billion of balance sheet reduction. My view is that the capital attachment associated with that $3 billion would be, I would say, well in excess of about $1 billion, probably close to $1.4 billion in terms of AE relief there. As to the profile vintage and otherwise, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more third-party funds, we\u2019re going to look across the portfolio, regardless of vintage of opportunities, particularly in this market, to advance. It\u2019s not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy, but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall, and so two components in the context of what we\u2019re trying to achieve strategically. If you look at what we\u2019ve done, just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising, you\u2019ll remember that through 2020, we noted that we had raised funds approximating $40 billion. Taking that and extending it through the first quarter, we\u2019re up just north of about $52 billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising. And so, the roster of ambition of what we\u2019re going to do this year is quite real. We\u2019re confident in our ability to achieve it. And this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what I was talking about, which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in, we will see compensation for that, if you will, in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate all that color. Thank you. Maybe a quick follow-up, just quickly on composition of that pipeline that you talked about. I think, I heard in your remarks that M&A is pretty darn good but underwriting actually is not bad also. I guess, my question is, how dependent is fulfilment of that pipeline on getting past this current SPAC indigestion here that we have? Just looking for a little more color on fulfilment of that pipeline. Stephen Scherr : Well, if you look at our overall backlog, which as I noted is at record levels, I would say that notwithstanding very high level of revenue recognition certainly in the investment banking segment, we\u2019re nonetheless seeing the backlog replenishment at extraordinarily high levels. And so, that\u2019s really the sort of best picture forward, if you will, in terms of what our clients are engaged in doing. I think, on the forward, as it relates, for example, to global markets, there it\u2019s difficult to say. As I noted in the comment and David did as well, it\u2019s hard to know what the market opportunity will be. The comparative set of results, second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters. I think, the confidence we\u2019re taking in terms of sustainability of results lies in our market share, and we have picked up market share across global markets, across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets, and we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. And first, let me just echo the sentiments on Heather. She\u2019s been truly exceptional in the IR role, so will be sorely missed. On to my questions, I guess, the first one is on the trading businesses, just to follow up on what you just said in terms of market share gains, it seems like the market share gains are actually accelerating in trading. And I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any more color really on what exactly is driving EBITDA gains in the quarter or over the last year, just a bit more specifics? And then, I know you -- both you and David have talked about the sustainability issue around trading, but it feels like trends are slowing a little bit here in April as we move into the summer, so just any sort of thoughts around what you think will support strength for the rest of the year? David Solomon : So Christian, I\u2019ll start and thanks for the question. First, I\u2019ll start at a high level and then Stephen will probably give you some more granular data. But at a high level, one of the things we\u2019ve been very focused on over the last 2.5 years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us, look at it holistically, see how we\u2019re serving their needs holistically. You\u2019ve heard us talk about our One GS mantra, our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients. And one of the things that I\u2019m hearing consistently from clients as I reach out and spend time with clients is that they feel like there\u2019s been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service they\u2019re getting, our focus on them, the resources we\u2019re getting, giving -- or bringing to them, and the coordination of all that. And I think that has contributed meaningfully, that client centricity, that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains. You know and we\u2019ve put it forward that we talked about looking at the top 100 accounts in global markets. We gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts, being top 3 against those accounts. That is a KPI we continue to track. We made progress last year, and we\u2019re committed to making further progress this year. And so, I think that also has an impact on this. In addition, then obviously you have the market activity that\u2019s generated. And so, we get the benefit of those market shares gain against that activity. On your second question with respect to kind of activity looking forward, what I\u2019d say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I don\u2019t think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. But I will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what I would say was a pre-COVID activity level by a meaningful amount. And I think as we said in the script that the environment, the monetary and fiscal stimulus, and in addition the economic recovery, continues to paint a relatively constructive background. But, I don\u2019t think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter. Stephen Scherr : So, Christian, just to pivot off of David\u2019s comments, all of which I\u2019ll give to you and our -- a reflection or a product of the client centricity that David was speaking to. First of all, across the equities business in global markets, I think we\u2019re seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the U.S., among which we are one. We saw elevated prime levels, part of the strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing, and as I noted in my comments, record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing. Even on the last call, I had noted that over the course of 2020 across global markets, we had picked up about 120 basis points of wallet share across the patch. And then when you look at -- I\u2019ll just take 2 individual businesses in FICC, just to pivot to FICC for a moment. First of all if you look at mortgages, the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business is now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight market-making and is now itself engaged in financing and loan origination. And so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature, if you will, of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business. And then, if you look at credit, we have picked up meaningful market share, both in cash and loans, in the context of what we\u2019re doing. And then the last thing I would say, which I think is a contributor to enhanced share, client engagement and the like has been what we\u2019ve done in the development of platforms. And credit is a good example of that, where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably. Our place in it is quite high. And so, again it\u2019s all, as David is saying, client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example. Christian Bolu : Maybe shifting on to expenses and expense management looking forward. I mean, I\u2019d argue that the opportunity set across pretty much all your businesses today are much bigger than certainly when you -- so much bigger today than when you set out some of those expense targets at Investor Day in early 2020. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about continuing along the path for those expense targets versus capitalizing on revenue opportunities that are ahead of you? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So the way I would think about expenses is the following. First of all in non-comp expense more broadly, there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base. I\u2019m saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at Investor Day, which I\u2019ll come on to. But our as reported, non-comp expense was up 5%; ex litigation, up 9%. And within that, literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transaction-based expenses, so BC&E relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend. And so, I think on the forward, you should expect that where transaction activity is high, where we\u2019re meeting our clients, where market opportunity is large, that variable expense will continue to fluctuate, consistent with the market and will carry us there. The second piece I\u2019ll comment on is just the $1.3 billion of expense initiative. Again, independent of the day-to-day focus on non-comp expense. And there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about, including our real estate footprint as we just announced that we\u2019re opening up offices in Birmingham. We did that as it relates to Hyderabad. All of that is a component piece of what we\u2019re trying to achieve in the $1.3 billion of expenses. The last piece I\u2019d say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation. As we\u2019ve said many, many times, we pay for performance. And so, that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance we\u2019ve otherwise seen in this quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start with a question on capital. Now, how does the Fed decision not to extend SLR relief, inform your capital management priorities? And maybe just give us a sense as to where you\u2019re comfortable running on that measure? Since some of the areas where you noted some gains, like prime are clearly going to be impacted by the prospect of potentially SLR being binding. And then just on risk-based ratios as well, if you could just speak to how you\u2019re thinking about the RWA trajectory as you continue to execute on the planned equity investment sales? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So, first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco is 6% at the bank. We stand higher than both of the minimums and don\u2019t find that to be a binding constraint to us. And so, I would say that at both levels, we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us. So SLR, not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks. In terms of RWA growth, I think that you\u2019ll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity that\u2019s there. The one thing I do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged. It is as disciplined as you would expect it to be, notwithstanding RWA growth. So, the opportunity set that\u2019s been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow risk-weighted assets commensurate with that opportunity, but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find. I mean, the thing I would say, Steve, on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet, in the service of our clients as David\u2019s been talking about, the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm. We\u2019re sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at GCLA north of $300 billion. We sit in an ample capital position, obviously elevated by where the minimums sit, but within -- in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients. Marry those two resource sort of points alongside risk controls that David spoke about, and we feel quite comfortable with the RWA growth we\u2019re experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view. Steven Chubak : And for my follow-up, I guess, both for you and David, just as a follow-up I guess really to Christian\u2019s earlier question, just on trading and IB normalization. I know this has been asked a number of different ways on recent calls. But just given the sheer pace of share gains and David, some remarks you actually made at a conference this quarter noting that industry fee pool should normalize above 2019 levels, it does feel to us like those two factors alone should support more than $3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading revenues, which actually compares to a target for incumbent business growth of just 2 billion to 3 billion. So, clearly some of the targets that you outlined at Investor Day on the revenue side do appear quite conservative, just given the sheer level of progress. I was hoping you could speak to your confidence around the ability to drive better growth in the incumbent businesses relative to those targets, and maybe if you feel like that north of 3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading is a reasonable expectation, given the underlying trends that you\u2019re seeing as well as the improved and deepened client penetration? David Solomon : So Steve, I appreciate the question, and you think about this in a similar way that we do. We\u2019ve always talked about how long-term market cap growth has led to long-term growth in our business broadly, but you\u2019ve got to look at it over long periods of time. I think, there are a variety of structural things that has supported growth in our core businesses, and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that. I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on your numbers, although I think that your numbers as you point out set very reasonable expectations for us to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. So I\u2019ll start by saying I am extremely confident of our ability to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. We also said at Investor Day that that is not our longer-term aspirations. And as the market continues to evolve, as we come out of the pandemic, as we have more clarity on how the world sets out moves forward, we\u2019ll give you clearer communication about our longer-term expectations for our ability to drive the franchise forward. But as we did pre-pandemic at Investor Day, I reiterate now, we do see opportunities to drive the franchises forward and drive higher returns over the long term than what our current medium-term targets are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : First, just a bigger picture question following on that, on that last one. In terms of the sustainability of some of the things that we\u2019re seeing in trading and banking, we haven\u2019t seen this level of GDP growth in terms of the forecasts for a very long time. So, just wanted to get your historical perspective on how this cycle compares and can that drive more activity? And then, David, I think you mentioned higher inflation as one of the risks or something that you\u2019re monitoring. So, I guess, just if we\u2019re in an environment where that starts to ramp up, how do you expect that to impact activity levels? David Solomon : Sure. So, I appreciate the question, Mike. And there\u2019s no question, if you look at a broader historical perspective, growth and activity levels in our business have been correlated to robust GDP growth around the world. And so, I\u2019d state quite clearly, and I said in the prepared remarks, that we think that we\u2019re going to have very, very robust economic growth in the second half of 2021 into 2022 as vaccines continue to accelerate, as we come out of the pandemic, as we move forward. There\u2019s no question that there is meaningful consumer pent-up demand. Consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic. And we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business. There\u2019s no question, given the monetary and fiscal actions, that there\u2019s an increasing risk of inflationary activity. We all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward. I think in my opinion, there is no question that we will see an increase in inflation. The question is how much, how quickly, and how we respond to that. And I think it\u2019s early -- it\u2019s very early to speculate. But there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly, and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business. I don\u2019t see that as obvious on the near-term horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic. But I do think it\u2019s a risk issue for markets that we\u2019ll have to continue to watch very closely. Mike Carrier : Stephen, just a quick one follow-up on the asset management business following Glenn\u2019s question. Just the fees, the management fees sequentially were a bit lower. I think you mentioned money market fee waivers. How significant was that? And then on the alternative fund-raising, how much of the funds that are being raised do you generate fees on committed capital versus deployed capital? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, on the money market comment, it was approximately $100 million in fee waivers. And bear in mind, very common practice, as you know, throughout the industry. So, nothing unusual about that. On the alternatives space, the management fees that we\u2019ll take in are on deployment of the investable capital that\u2019s already beginning. And so, you\u2019ll continue to see that. I did note that on one of the charts that we show, which looks at firm-wide assets under supervision and firm-wide management and other fees, it\u2019s a slide where my ambition is to disclose more. Particularly as these alternative funds become deployed, we can start to share more with you about how much of that management fee across the whole of the business, never mind the segment in which it sits, but across the whole of the firm, is being generated by this strategic pivot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions, the first one is on the backlog. You indicated that the backlog is I think you mentioned historic levels. But, I\u2019m just trying to understand how much -- like what\u2019s the multiple of the prior peak that your backlog is running at right now? Stephen Scherr : Yes. I would say that I\u2019d have to go back and look at where the sort of prior record was set, but it\u2019s certainly at a record. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of composition in it, which is that it\u2019s cutting across a range of businesses. We\u2019re seeing higher-than-normal replenishment and backlog build in EMEA and in Asia than we are in the Americas. But bear in mind, overall size of the business in the Americas is quite significant. So, notional dollars would be higher there, but it\u2019s showing some geographic composition. To my memory, I wouldn\u2019t view it as a multiple to prior peak. I would call it as probably 10% higher than where the top of that number had been historically. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately, Steve, I think you mentioned a comment about the dividend and you would look to raise that as soon as you could. Could you give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the sizing of that is? Typically, people look at the dividend payout ratio relative to estimated forward earnings. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the metric that you\u2019re thinking about, but if you can give us some color. Because of the revenue volatility that you have, some pieces lower, some pieces higher, maybe give us a sense as to what we should be keying in on when we\u2019re thinking about where to take dividend in our estimates. Stephen Scherr : Yes. So I don\u2019t want to peg the exact sort of aspiration of where we\u2019ll be, and our ambition is to take the dividend up when the rules permit. But I would say that our ambition is to put the dividend in a more competitive standing than perhaps where it has sat historically. By the way, we\u2019ve already been on that path, having raised the dividend quite considerably since David and John and I all took our seats. And so, to my memory, we took it up about 47% or thereabout at the beginning of our tenure, and higher since. I think, the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business. As the more durable businesses or revenue streams and businesses grow, the dividend ought to reflect that, and it will. And so, that\u2019s probably the best sort of forward view on dividend thinking that I can provide. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Can you just give more color on -- it looks like market share gains, but maybe by different category. So, one category would be size of client. I know you have this middle market expansion effort. Was that a record, and how is that doing? A second category could be kind of corporate versus others. A couple of years ago, you were behind with the corporates. You were trying to catch up. And a third category would be geographic. You mentioned EMEA and Asia on a go-forward basis, but just as we look at the first quarter. Stephen Scherr : So, we don\u2019t break down the backlog exactly that way, but let me just provide as much color as I can on this. First of all in the middle market, that continues to grow. And the revenue that we\u2019ve taken in, in investment banking around the growth in the client set has been quite substantial, and frankly I think beyond that which we otherwise thought we would achieve at the Investor Day. On the corporate side, you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly. I would say equally, we\u2019re playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do. And then, on the geography, as I mentioned before, we have seen kind of double-digit growth in backlog in EMEA and in Asia. And we continue to see growth in the Americas as well. But again, the Americas presents a much larger set more broadly. I\u2019d also refer you back to a comment David made and we\u2019ve spoken about before, which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets. It\u2019s always been there as it relates to investment banking, has put us in among the top 3 among 64 of the most prolific clients, top 100 clients in global markets, and that\u2019s up from 51 the year before. And so, we continue to see growth in the share we\u2019re taking. By the way, this is all against the backdrop of consolidation in share, I would say, among U.S. banks relative to the European competitors across a range of product areas in equities and in FICC. Mike Mayo : And you mentioned record prime balances. So, after the recent hedge fund incident, do you see some players retreating, and there you\u2019d have a flight-to-quality effect with players coming to you, or is something else taking place? Stephen Scherr : I mean, I think it\u2019s too early to judge whether there\u2019ll be a significant shift. I suspect that there\u2019ll be certain clients that look to migrate from where they were to a different firm, but it\u2019s too early to judge that. I think, the important thing to note is that growth in prime has been a strategic imperative for us. It\u2019s not the by-product of the Archegos incident or the like. And as we grow that, and this is what David was referring to, we continue to maintain quite a vigilant posture as it relates to risk that\u2019s embedded in it. We recognize risk of concentration. We recognize the consumptive nature of that business. And so, we\u2019re going to maintain kind of our threshold of risk tolerance in terms of clients that we bring on. Whether or not it shows consolidation in prime, pricing pressure in prime, I suspect it might, but it\u2019s just too early to judge that just yet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan. Kian Abouhossein : Yes. Hi. First of all, thanks to Heather for all her support. I have two questions. The first one relates to global markets. You clearly indicated that this has been fueled by the very strong liquidity macro environment that we\u2019ve seen. And clearly, all sublines have performed extremely, both last year and the first quarter. And I wanted to understand how you make decisions about spending additional dollars in terms of investments structurally in these businesses, considering everything is performing extremely well and most likely asking for budget. So, if you can just talk about the business lines that you\u2019re investing as well as the geography. Stephen Scherr : Well, the one that I would call out is credit in FICC just as an example, and I mentioned it earlier. So, this is where we saw a trend line developing around portfolio trading. And so, investments that we were making in platforms and technology capabilities and the like have served us well in the capture of a solid percentage of the portfolio trading and the volumes that are going through there. And so, that\u2019s an example of advancing and enhancing our technology capabilities that are in place. I\u2019d also point out more generally that over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been spending quite a bit of money on straight-through processing. That is, taking note of the demands among our clients around middle and back office and the overall experience of our clients set not just on the front end of the trade, but all through to the back. Each of those investments, whether it\u2019s technology to build platforms that captures portfolio trading credit, or development of enhanced technology to automate and streamline the overall straight-through processing, all of that is subject to an ROI framework with an eye toward improving the overall client and user experience that\u2019s there. And so, that\u2019s just a little bit of insight into how we think about the investment and where we\u2019ve been making that investment. Kian Abouhossein : And my second question is coming back to technology. Stephen, you also mentioned in your remarks, clearly the focus on technology platforms and the front office experience for clients that you have improved and are improving. But maybe you could elaborate a little bit more in detail. For example, how much of your business is cloud based? How much do you want to get to cloud? How many platforms do you have on the trading side, and how many do you envision to have in the future? And on the front office side, we hear from a lot of banks that they\u2019re very good at the new platform operations that they are dealing with. But just wondering what is the experience at Goldman that makes it so different, in your view. Stephen Scherr : Well, I\u2019m not sure I have it at my hand kind of the number of systems and the like. But let me answer the question this way, and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example, okay? Transaction banking is a new platform designed from the front end all the way through to the back, into the books and records of the firm. It is cloud-based engineering, which has all the efficiencies that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like. And so, our new builds are largely, perhaps not exclusively, but largely cloud-based. We\u2019re always looking to rationalize platforms. And I would say one thing I\u2019ve learned from Marco Argenti and George in engineering is that it\u2019s as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in. We\u2019re riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology, build in the cloud. And I think some of the newer businesses that we\u2019re involved in, transaction banking consumer, benefit from the absence of legacy, so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just curious that you guys are building out -- Marcus is a big strategic priority for you. You rolled out the Marcus Invest. We\u2019ve got check writing coming. When we look at some of the fintech platforms and what they\u2019ve embraced recently, there\u2019s been a lot of excitement around offering crypto. You made a few comments on crypto and the outlook for how to engage in crypto in your institutional business. But, are you also considering including the offering of crypto wallets and whatnot on the consumer front, where it seems as though there might be -- but certainly competitors have found an ability to offer that capability, which has driven a lot of excitement and a lot of growth? David Solomon : Sure. I appreciate the question, Brennan. And at a high level, obviously we\u2019re monitoring this all very quickly. We have a plan at the moment to build a digital bank that\u2019s offering an array of integrated basic services in a completely digital, frictionless platform. And we\u2019re extremely focused on that. At the moment, we are not focused on offering a crypto wallet ahead of providing what I\u2019ll call more basic set of financial services on a digital platform. We\u2019ll obviously monitor how the world evolves with this. We\u2019ll see how things progress and we\u2019ll continue to watch it. But I\u2019m not going to comment further on longer term plans for individuals. We\u2019ve been focused on other things. And with respect to crypto, payment systems, the digitization of money, we\u2019ve been much more focused on the institutional side. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s fair. Thanks. Walk before you run, maybe a little different than some of the fintech competitors. Anyway, let\u2019s see, broadening it out a little bit and thinking about your strategic targets and the new directions that you\u2019re going. Stephen, you often flag the components and how much of the revenue is recurring, which it\u2019s probably underappreciated. Have you considered -- you guys have done a lot with disclosure, and it\u2019s been great and very constructive. Have you considered making some adjustments in the disclosures, which would help investors and analysts to model some of those recurring revenues and show them as more mechanical, so to speak? For example with consumer banking -- I mean consumer banking is the one that seems much clear to me. You just provide the revenue line, but we don\u2019t know what the breakdown is in fees versus NII. We don\u2019t know what the direct balances are tied to that. We don\u2019t know credit metrics that would allow for some sort of more mechanical calculations, and I think might assist in the appreciation of how much of your revenue base is actually recurring amongst the analysts and investor community. Have you considered any of those changes or shifts? And do you think that might help in greater appreciation of those recurring revenue streams? Stephen Scherr : So Brennan, first of all, thanks for the feedback. I mean, it\u2019s a big area of focus for us. The strategy has clearly been to develop out businesses that exhibit greater durability to the revenue stream. And there\u2019s no question that disclosure will follow, in the context of providing all of you with greater insight into where we think or where we would define recurring and durability of earnings that are there. On the specific points you raised around consumer, I think as consumer grows, and so David was reflecting before that that business is now turning a corner to sort of resemble the ambition of a broader platform than it is a series of products. We\u2019d like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer, just as an example. I would say, the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable. These are areas where as they become more material, and we expect that they will, disclosure will naturally follow. And then, I think your feedback is a good one, just in the context of providing a firm-wide perspective through disclosure on durability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : A question here just on kind of the M&A environment, obviously a lot of activity going on in financials and fintech right now. So, I\u2019d love to maybe just get some perspective on what you guys are seeing within Goldman specifically in terms of opportunities and what the appetite is, and also whether anything has changed? Clearly, the stock is at kind of a new level here. It\u2019s up 30% year-to-date, still only maybe 10x earnings, but we\u2019re at levels that you haven\u2019t been at. So, I\u2019d just love to maybe get some context on the backdrop overall and then maybe how the appetite might be evolving. David Solomon : I appreciate the question, Devin. On the backdrop overall, I assume by the backdrop overall, you\u2019re just talking about broad M&A activity. There\u2019s been a meaningful pickup as confidence in the forward has increased. And the comments that Stephen made about backlog broadly and the constructive nature of this environment is obviously leading to clients being extremely engaged around strategic objectives that allow them to drive their businesses forward. Really in all businesses everywhere, we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong -- with consolidation by those that are in a strong position. Because all businesses continue in the digital world we\u2019re in with further digitization require more tech investment, more scale, more global. And so, in that context, obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions. With respect to our space broadly and how we think about this, I\u2019m going to repeat verbatim what I said last quarter, and what I\u2019ve said before. We spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise. In particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth, if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives, we would certainly consider it. But the bar for anything significant is high. And it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stock is higher. And so, we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth, but the bar to do it is high. Prices are high. It\u2019s a competitive environment. And we feel good about our plan, but we\u2019ll continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. And then, just a follow-up here, we\u2019ve received some investor questions just over some of the recent press reports around some management movement or departures even in some of the newer businesses. And I think the question is more, clearly Goldman has a deep bench and is a large organization, so sometimes I think the context gets lost. But, the question is more around whether there\u2019s any implication of a strategy evolution or shifts from at least what some of the press is picking up. I\u2019d love to just get a comment if you can on that. David Solomon : Sure. We feel very, very good about our team that\u2019s in place. We have a very, very deep bench. And I think we\u2019re in a great position with the leaders that are in place. One of the things I just observe broadly, and it\u2019s consistent with our performance, it\u2019s consistent with stock market values and prices, it\u2019s consistent with the environment that we\u2019re in, there is a lot of activity in the world. There\u2019s a lot of liquidity in the world. And the world is very, very competitive for great talent. We\u2019ve always been a developer of strong talent, and we\u2019ve always been a place where people come to look for great talent. There\u2019s nothing about any of the attrition this year that looks extraordinary when you look back over a multiyear basis. And I think we\u2019re very well positioned, but there are a lot of opportunities out there. And at times as I said in my script, people will go choose other things because they have bigger opportunities, and we welcome that. Often, they become clients when they make these moves. We rarely lose people to competitors. So, I feel good about where we sit from a talent perspective. I feel good about the interest that we\u2019re finding people have in coming to be a part of Goldman Sachs and join the journey that we\u2019re on to continue to grow the firm. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys give us a little more color? I think, you touched on when you\u2019re permitted to increase the dividend, which I would assume would be third quarter when we go to the stress capital buffer construct, that that might be an opportunity for the Board to take up a dividend increase. But, in terms of just with your CET1 ratio, I believe at Investor Day I think you guys said the medium-term target was 13% to 13.5%. Could you share with us how you expect to manage to that number with share repurchases, once we get into the stress capital buffer construct? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think the way to think about it is that share repurchase is going to follow kind of a longstanding philosophy where we look at opportunities across the firm to deploy capital and where those returns are attractive as they have been this past quarter, we\u2019ll continue to do that. Where we don\u2019t, we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase, with the dividend obviously being a reflection, as I commented earlier, of greater confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that net dividend increase to reflect it. On the achievement of the 13% to 13.5%, I would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what we\u2019re doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm. So, key among those initiatives sits in asset management, where the pivot from on-balance sheet to third-party fund is as much about creating a durable, more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business, and therefore of the firm. And to the extent that happens, we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity. But my expectation is that the Fed will recognize it equally and subsequent CCAR exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have. And it\u2019s on top of that that we\u2019ll maintain what I view, we view, as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients. So, less about share repurchase, more about fundamental shifts in change that we\u2019re bringing to the business, both to help ourselves and frankly speaking, to enable the Fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business. Gerard Cassidy : And then, to follow up, the outlook that you guys have described is quite positive. The Federal Reserve has pointed out there\u2019s going to be strong growth this year for this economy, the global economy as well, as we all are expecting. Aside from the pandemic taking a reversal and it sets us all back and aside from a recession, what -- and I know, David, you already touched on inflation as being a risk. What are some of risks that you keep your eyes on that could kind of set the outlook back, maybe not as robust as it appears to be for you and some of your peers today? David Solomon : Well, there\u2019s risk in markets constantly. And part of markets and economic growth is rooted to confidence. And things can go wrong -- things can go wrong at any time. And things tend to pop up in places that you don\u2019t see or you don\u2019t expect. I think, we have a very, very constructive environment, Gerard, given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic. The weightiness of that, the heft of that really overshadows most else that\u2019s going on. I do think over time, we\u2019ll be having discussions about the increase in government debt and government spending around the world. There will be consequence to that. That can obviously have an impact over time. There\u2019s a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very, very long. Certainly, given some of the actions that are taken, you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly. And that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity. But I do think we have a very, very good backdrop at the moment with a higher probability or distribution of strong economic growth, because we had such a sharp reaction to the other side, given the pandemic. And the unwind of that I think will dominate as we move through the rest of the year into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I had a question on the prime book. I know it says that you\u2019re at a record in the first quarter of this year. But, is there a way to frame like the overall exposure from prime? Kind of like what the balance sheet exposure is? What the market shares are from that business? Stephen Scherr : Well, kind of hard to put precision around that. I would simply say that we have made it, as I\u2019ve said, a strategic priority to grow prime balances. I would say that our business has skewed historically more to the long short, and less so competitively relative to the comp -- to the quants. But our ambition is to continue to grow it. But as I said before, that growth is not going to happen absent corresponding risk insight into how that book grows. We\u2019re very, very aware of the embedded risk in it. We\u2019re very aware of the liquidity consumption in that book. And so, we mind ourselves as we grow volumes in that. But it\u2019s been part and parcel again to the theme of durability around financing that goes on in and around that business. And so, the balances have grown consistent with that. David Solomon : And the only other comment I\u2019d make, Brian, around the business is that there is a clear consolidation going on with the leaders because of scale, because of technology capability. And I think we\u2019re well positioned for that trend if that trend continues going forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : And maybe another look at the prime business though. Is there any way to frame kind of where leverage is on the underlying client level today versus where it was pre-COVID? I mean, are we seeing a lot of massive increase in leverage versus where we were before? Stephen Scherr : Well, I would say -- I mean, listen. It depends a lot on the collateral pool that you have. Let me describe it this way. It\u2019s hard for us to know what goes on in every other bank around the street. I can only speak to what we know and watch inside of Goldman Sachs. And so, what David was describing, particularly around Archegos, the story is less about the events of Archegos as much as how we\u2019re set up to monitor it. And so, we look at consolidated or overly consolidated concentrated positions in individual accounts. We look for excessive position concentration across the whole of our business. We look and undertake a daily mark-to-market on collateral and corresponding margin. And in tracking concentration and correlation, we adjust what it is that we\u2019re doing, the level of margin we take, the clients we take in, the pricing we put against that prime. Those are all the important inputs in terms of how we grow that business broadly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just talking a little bit about the implications of the explosive growth in the SPAC market. You guys have had pretty good market share there. I guess, number one, do you think -- there\u2019s clearly a lot of pent-up demand for M&A that has to get done in the next 24 months. Does that make you even more excited about the M&A prospects for you and the industry? And should we see a subsequent sort of cooling off in the underwriting side, just because the demand -- the amount of capital-chasing deals seems very high? David Solomon : So, a couple of comments at a high level. I mean, there\u2019s no question that given the number of SPACs that have been raised, the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively. Given our position in the M&A market, that should be a tailwind. That said, just to quantify it, when you look at our M&A activity, that M&A activity for us with SPACs last quarter, I think it was a single-digit percentage of the M&A activity that we participated in. So, while it\u2019s a tailwind, I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s dominating the M&A activity and the positive constructive comments we made around M&A. In fact, that\u2019s really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that we\u2019ve seen a big pickup in over the course of the last 6 to 9 months. With respect to underwriting activity, there\u2019s no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was. I think there\u2019s a little indigestion in the context of that. You\u2019ve obviously seen returns and some of the shells kind of slowed at this point. I\u2019d also highlight just again kind of backlog, that when you look at ECM revenue last quarter, SPACs were less than 15% of our ECM revenue last quarter. So, this all creates a tailwind. But my guess is in this quarter, you\u2019ll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter. And you\u2019ll see a continued progress that people try to find M&A targets to destack. All of that should be constructive for our business. Jim Mitchell : And as a follow-up, do you see any sort of longer-term good or bad with -- you noted that it\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s probably here to stay. Do you see it a net positive for the investment banking industry, or just it\u2019s another quiver in for financing? David Solomon : Well, I think it\u2019s another form of capital formation and financing. But what I tried to highlight in my remarks, Jim, is that I think it\u2019s going to continue to evolve. I think there\u2019s room for improvement in disclosures, and you\u2019ll see us continue to push to improve disclosures. I think, you\u2019ll see different structures around incentive alignment for sponsors, and I think you\u2019ll see an evolution in that. So, like any other innovation,, they evolve, they mature. But I do think capital formation that leads to more liquidity in markets and more opportunities for investors to participate is generally a good thing. But how it\u2019s done, the disclosure around it, the incentives, the transparency, all those things are things where I think there\u2019s room for progress around this innovation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane. Jeremy Sigee : I just wanted to go back to the Archegos comments you were making early on and what it means for the prime brokerage business more broadly. And I just wondered if you could comment on how unusual Archegos was compared to other funds that you do business with in prime brokerage in terms of their leverage or their investment position? So, was this an ordinary situation, like multiple others that you do business with that just went wrong, or was this some kind of real outlier to start with? David Solomon : At a high level, in a high level, Jeremy, it\u2019s hard to make generalizations around these things. But I think what was unusual here was for a variety of reasons. This particular fund wound up with very concentrated positions very quickly, and I think that was unusual. And then, the actions that they chose to take, or chose not to take, obviously affected the outcome. But,, I think it was unusual with respect to the size and the concentration of positions, which changed relatively quickly. Jeremy Sigee : And just to follow up, do you expect any change in how you do business as a result of this incident, or how the industry does business, either in terms of risk limits, margin levels, capital requirements, either that you determine or that maybe the regulators are going to determine for this business? David Solomon : I think, we always look at every experience we have on a day-to-day basis, and we always try to learn and we always adjust. And there\u2019s no question that we spent a lot of time looking at this, even though I feel that we executed very well here. We got this one right. We don\u2019t always get everything right. So we always look at every situation to try to tweak and improve our risk management processes and how we think about these things. I do think that there -- given the visibility of this, I do think there\u2019ll be regulatory discussion around it. As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ll participate constructively in those discussions. But, I think it\u2019s too early to speculate one way or another whether it will have any impact. I do think to some degree, this was a one-off event. But as I said earlier, we will see from time to time people get overly concentrated. They have too much leverage, and that leads to unwinds. Stephen Scherr : Well, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Carey and the IR team. Otherwise, please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 13, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Thank you, Erica. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high-level review of our second quarter performance and our client franchise. He will also provide an update on the operating environment and the macroeconomic backdrop. Stephen will then discuss our second quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I will now pass the call over to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning.  I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a review of our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02. Second quarter results contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion, which drove year-to-date ROE of 27.3% and ROTE of 28.9%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm\u2019s strategic priorities across all four of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day. In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerge from the pandemic, the drive for scale, the push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set. We\u2019ve maintained a number one ranking completed M&A for 19 over the last 20 years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for nine of last 10 years. We have broadening our Transaction Banking platform. In June, we launched in the UK and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive. We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We continued to deploy balance sheet to support client activity and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms. A good example is our marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus \u2013 via APIs. In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds, where we have raised $74 billion in gross commitments across a range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day. Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China\u2019s largest bank. The JV will combine our expertise in asset management with ICBC\u2019s extensive access to retail and institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our longstanding relationship with ICBC and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally. In Consumer and Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating the leading digital consumer banking platform, where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high. This quarter, we launched Apple Card Family, which allows co-owners on the same account to build credit together as equals. In addition, as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering.  All in the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and increasing durability of our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our Board of Directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by 150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won\u2019t necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy.  With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on Page 2. It\u2019s clear that we are in the middle of the significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the U.S. and China, driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and in the United States, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending.  A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the U.S. economy overheating. But recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the central bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and then any resulting risks could be adequately managed. From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The delta variant, should it spread further, could spear policy actions with slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe.  While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts. At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the United States, Hong Kong and India among other locations, building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic.  More broadly as risk managers, we closely monitor developments and retain \u2013 remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an ever-changing market backdrop. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with corporate client \u2013 with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may prove more volatile, as supplemental benefits expire in the U.S., corporate clients remained steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic. In our Markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand for both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform. Before I turn it over to Stephen, I\u2019d like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team and I am so proud of how we\u2019ve worked tirelessly to serve our clients and with the challenges over the last 18 months.  Again and again, I\u2019ve heard from our clients that they say Goldman Sachs stay ahead of the curves and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever. Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer.  With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic and we\u2019ll continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need. Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate. I\u2019ve heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We\u2019ve always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives and we will continue to do so.  That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bond to support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive. I am particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in person working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs. I\u2019ll close by saying I am very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. I am especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop.  Importantly, we are making progress in executing our strategy, and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment beginning on Page 4.  Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial Advisory revenues of $1.3 billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and increasing market position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint.  We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $975 billion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 33%. Activity continues to be strong across geographies, particularly in the Americas with strength across all industry groups reflecting the breadth of our franchise. Underwriting performance remained very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues following on from a record performance in the first quarter. Equity underwriting performance in particular, continued to be strong, generating $1.2 billion in revenues amid elevated IPO activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with revenues of over $1 billion.  We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in the first half climbing to $85 billion across 400 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%, up 40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date, more than all of last year. In Debt Underwriting net revenues were $950 million with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes and importantly, robust acquisition financing activity including LBOs, as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our Financing and Advisory businesses, as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity.  Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in Europe with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to continue in future quarters. Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity, as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Corporate Lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from Transaction Banking and Middle Market and Relationship Lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book.  Transaction Banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients, generating roughly $40 billion in deposits with an increasing percentage becoming operational. Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter, driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive market making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both FICC and equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes. We remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment. Beginning with FICC on Page 6, second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was impacted by spread compression, amid lower volatility, though activity remained high with a number of macroeconomic cross currents, around economic recovery and inflation.  In Commodities, we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, Ags and metals and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows. In Mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market making, loan origination and financing.  Across both credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters though market share gains helped offset the effects of a relatively subdued trading environment.  FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance. Moving to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives. In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels and in derivatives, we saw solid performance in EMEA following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies. Equities Financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business. Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients. While growth in equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement. Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion. Management and other fees totaled $727 million, which rose year-on-year, despite approximately $160 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment. Incentive fees for the quarter was $78 million. Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion, amid a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly one-third of these revenues. The growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth-stage, technology-driven companies spanning multiple industries. Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $900 million, driven by market appreciation on investments including Privia Health, KnowBe4 and Flywire. We will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit.  Across our $17 billion private equity book, we\u2019ve generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than two-thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in Oncoclinicas, a Brazilian oncology business; Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a messaging software firm. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million, driven by NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 8, we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to Page 9. We included this page in today\u2019s earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business.  The message on the page is simple, while the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion.  These dispositions have been largely offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of approximately $5 billion, given the supportive market backdrop mentioned, as well as modest additions to the balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction.  As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this disposition activity, particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR. Moving to Page 10, Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion.  Private Banking and Lending revenues were $260 million with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives. We remained focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals, representing a significant AUS opportunity.  Consumer Banking revenues were $363 million in the quarter reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans. The low-rate environment, as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15 months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this. Next, let\u2019s turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees.  Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion. On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest earning assets. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by Wealth Management and Residential Real Estate Warehouse Lending, as well as Apple Card.  Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction, driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop, partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm. Let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth.  Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at 34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results, in line with our pay-for-performance culture. Non-compensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation cost. Excluding the impact of litigation, non-compensation was up approximately 6% relative to top-line growth of 16% as increases in transaction base and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities. We remained focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% and we\u2019ll monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our balance sheet and capital on Slide 14. On June 28th, we disclosed the Federal Reserve\u2019s indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.4% effective October 1.  As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share. While our expectation of the Federal Reserve stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses.  In light of our most recent SCB, we recognized that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR cycle and achieving our target in the medium term, by definition will be more challenging. That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We have prioritized deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share repurchases.  In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $329 billion. On the liabilities side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter and our long-term debt also rose by $20 billion, driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance. Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our Fixed Income Call in May, our year-to-date benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year contrary to our intention at the start of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm.  We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring non-bank funding persist, albeit at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half. Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally.  To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the U.S. bank bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm-wide balance sheet. In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium-term return targets with a path to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. A quick follow-up. You noted the record prime brokerage, prime financing balances and curious if you could drill down a little bit on how much is environment versus - and engagement of clients versus new clients and market share gains? And while we are on the topic, I\u2019d love to know, if you have any thoughts following the Archegos incident. What has or do you expect to change in the industry as a result? Thanks. David Solomon : Thanks a lot, Glenn. So on prime balances, they have grown. They\u2019ve grown kind of consistent with the broader strategy that we set up. As to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients, I would say it\u2019s both. I would say the environment obviously by virtue of balance is accreting in this market, that has grown balances and we\u2019ve obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients and, frankly speaking, to be more profound with our existing ones. But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there is a clear screen, which looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms, both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances. And so, we are being rather judicious in the context of what we bring to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and clients and our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way. On the part of your question relating to Archegos, look, this has obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators. Kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields.  I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be supportive of, there will be moves by regulators to achieve that. But very hard to say, kind of, as to where that all plays out. As we shared in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just to follow up on\u2026 David Solomon : Sure. Glenn Schorr : \u2026on two of the new business builds. You mentioned the Family Card with Apple. I am curious on \u2013 in what customer segment you are going after with that? And maybe a bigger question on, do you have any numbers for us in terms of accounts balances or new partners who want to talk about? And maybe that same comment question for transaction banking clients, deposits, just tracking progress, I appreciate it. Thanks. David Solomon : Sure. So, progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say, let\u2019s start with Apple Card. The press around creating the family plan was frankly speaking to achieve a greater and more positive user experience. So that people across a family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that move will accelerate share. But I think more importantly, and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience. On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of COVID, we\u2019ve seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than we thought.  And we\u2019ve now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth consistent with the tone of the consumer market that we are seeing. And I think there is more opportunities to be had with Apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So, you\u2019ll start to see forward growth, and I suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increase in originations and underwriting in Apple Card and the family plan will only serve to help that.  In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We are upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion of deposits. And perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we are starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that\u2019s obviously the linchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm. I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It\u2019s turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we are offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket. And so, as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are going to start to see geographic expansion both to the UK and Japan. We\u2019ve set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so, I think that business will continue to play forward.  And perhaps what\u2019s most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which we are able to sell in through an existing client base. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe just start off with the equity investments portfolio and thanks very much for the roll forward of Slide 9. I guess I have a two-parter on that slide. It\u2019s a high-class problem, but you sold nearly $6 billion in positions and you made basically no progress in reducing the equity investment portfolio. So, curious what else you can do to bring that portfolio down? And then, maybe more broadly, is it time to rethink the sort of disposition strategy? Your stock is at all-time highs. The market is rewarding your stock for strong revenue growth and ROE expansion and they don\u2019t really care about capital position. So, I mean, should you just not just cut the buybacks, focus on revenue growth, rather than potentially making uneconomic investment dispositions? David Solomon : So, thanks, Christian. We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made progress on our goal with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing. And I\u2019ll let Stephen highlight some of the details in the moment \u2013 at the moment. But we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions. I think it\u2019s a very constructive environment for us to do so and I think we\u2019ll continue to do that. You\u2019ll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions.  We continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues and the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we are doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that.  On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decrease our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business. And so, if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we will continue to do it, but we want to remain and I think we\u2019ve always been a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so, when we see those opportunities, we will make investments and we\u2019ll continue to grow the business. If for some reason the environment changes and we don\u2019t, we will return that capital appropriately to shareholders. Stephen, do you want to comment just on the progress along those sell-downs, because we have made real targeted progress and we\u2019ll continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we\u2019ve set out. Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, I guess, let\u2019s just start kind of with the facts. Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5 billion did come off-balance sheet producing $4 billion of capital relief. And as I mentioned, there is another $3 billion that\u2019s in sight to take $1 billion of capital down. Now, that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity portfolio. There is consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on-balance sheet, all of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital. Now why does that matter and why we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it? Well, first of all, obviously, we are looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm, which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we\u2019ve raised since Investor Day, $75 billion of new funds in those funds, okay? We\u2019ll increase assets under supervision and equally we\u2019ll increase fee revenue that\u2019s being generated by those investments in that fund format. And so, in a way the page to watch on the forward will be Page 11 of our Investor Day presentation, because what\u2019s going to play out and we promise more disclosure which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses.  And I think that\u2019s the broader picture if you will in terms of what we are trying to achieve. What we put on Page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made much as it would otherwise be masked by as you put it kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning, Steve. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question just on the investment banking outlook. First half revenue is a record. You started the record backlog or closing continued strong share gains.  One of the interesting metrics that was provided recently by John at a recent conference was that, you sell $1.7 billion benefit just from share gains in global markets and just given some of the momentum in the investment banking side, I didn\u2019t know if you could help frame how much of a revenue benefit you are seeing from those share gains and is there any risk to the \u2013 sort of disruption in the current environment, especially given the Biden Executive Order that was recently published? David Solomon : Sure. So, a couple of thoughts on that broadly. I mean, the environment for investment banking activity, Steven, continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there is a good chance that that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues. In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving CEOs and Boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world.  And we are seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go-forward basis. And the world that\u2019s actually evolving quite quickly, I am encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high record levels and a lot of that I think feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment.  Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely given where we are positioned today. With respect to global markets, we picked up a 160 basis points of market share through quarter one and that\u2019s allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us. I don\u2019t have specific market share KPIs on investment banking to share right on this call, we can certainly follow-up more broadly on some things. Obviously, we tracked our \u2013 we track our lead table position both in M&A and equity and debt and there, we\u2019ve been strengthening our position over time and it\u2019s consistently at the top of those lead tables. What I do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint and the footprint of available clients let\u2019s say are in the $500 million to $3 billion enterprise value has been significant.  It\u2019s grown and we\u2019ve continued to expand that footprint and we\u2019re quite effective at penetrating that. And so that\u2019s been a very good opportunity for us and I actually think that opportunity will continue. I think our Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue as we have been to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades and the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong, differentiated and very, very front-footed with our clients. And so, there certainly could be macro events over 12, 24, 36 months period that slowed down the current momentum, but at the moment, it feels quite constructive. Steven Chubak : Thanks for all that color, David and just for my follow-up, relating to the line of questioning tied to Christian\u2019s question just on the equity investment portfolio, recognizing that barring a net reduction in that portfolio, understanding there is other metrics we have to monitor, it might be difficult to really see any meaningful SCB improvement at least in the near-term.  I was hoping to get some perspective just given the multiple re-rating that you\u2019ve seen, the strong momentum in the business, as well as the fact that the SCB is feeling some upward pressure, whether your views on a transformational M&A are evolving at all and whether a potential acquisition could at least tell potentially mitigate some of the pressures from the global market shock that seem to be driving that upward pressure on the capital ratio. David Solomon : At a high level and I appreciate the question, Steven, I don\u2019t think our views on transformational M&A have evolved. Call-after-call, quarter-after-quarter I\u2019ve said and I\u2019ll say again that the bar would always be extremely high for us to do something very, very significant.  But I\u2019ve also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and create more durable revenues comes, as both Stephen and I have highlighted in our remarks, from continuing to invest in and grow our Asset Management business, continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our Wealth Management business and for broadening our digital Consumer Banking platform. There may be opportunities from time-to-time that can accelerate the direction of travel in those. We look at things constantly. If we see things that could accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate our goals in those businesses, we\u2019ll certainly consider them always \u2013 always with a high bar.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise you that prices at the moment are high and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things. But we are making a lot of progress organically and we continue to be focused on that organic growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Just as an incremental follow-up on everything you just said, David, how do we think about the sizing of the equity investment book that you are looking for? I totally get that mark-ups are adding to this right now. But the $1.5 billion in addition, there is lots of great opportunities out there. Should we expect that over time the equity investments book should be rising? Or is there a goal of size of this portfolio that you are looking to manage to over the next call it, two to three years? David Solomon : Well, the strategy \u2013 the strategy has been to take a broad Asset Management business and particularly around alternatives that has been extremely balance sheet heavy and turn it into more of a fund-based model and we\u2019ve only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly. And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day, we\u2019ve raised $75 billion in fund structure. I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as GP alongside our institutional investors and so there will always be equity investments through our fund participation, but the cycle that we are going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller and therefore the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than it\u2019s been. Now it\u2019s a good problem if the market keeps going up and therefore the value seems to be staying the same even though we are making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven\u2019t put out a target number, but by definition, it will get smaller. In the near-term, our balance sheet will come down and our AE target is a little less than $18 billion. Stephen Scherr : The only other thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that if you look at Page 8 in the presentation, on the left-hand side, you can see we\u2019ve been talking a lot about the $21 billion of equity investments. But equally consolidated investment entities of $18 billion is fertile ground to continue to bring this down and reduce down the AE in the segment.  And so, all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that and we are committed to get to it notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio, because as you rightly point out, that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions. Betsy Graseck : Right, because I should be thinking about the $21 billion in terms of density of capital usage, kind of the old methodology when you were 25% invested in these funds to new which is more like 3% or less invested in the funds. So obviously, the latter is less capital-intensive.  I guess, the other question is, in addition to Page 8, left-hand side that you mentioned, are there other things we should be thinking about for bringing the SCB down? Or would you say, hey look, Page 8 left-hand side, that\u2019s really the bulk of the actions that we are interested in taking? Stephen Scherr : Well, look, I think, the way to think about this is that, we are not waiting for the Fed to deliver us a result that\u2019s satisfactory, okay, much as we are petitioning them on some issues that are relevant. We are taking a lot of self-help here.  We\u2019ve been talking about one, the overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor into the way in which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation. So it\u2019s not just limited to this. It means, what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David spoke about and I did of $75 billion and growing in fund format.  What does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way presumably by the Fed to yield a better PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we are not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on balance sheet investing.  And then, again, we remain quite engaged with the Fed, as we put our letter in last year and we will only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about M&A. The advisory business in banking and Stephen touched on this, but maybe I wanted to be a bit more explicit. So, we\u2019ve seen a bit more hawkishness on the anti-trust side, not only with the recent Executive Order, but also with some of the actions tied to certain deals.  What kind of an impact do you expect this might happen \u2013 have on volumes and velocity in the M&A market broadly? And I believe you touched on the fact that sponsor activity was a big \u2013 has been a big contributor to M&A volume. How much of that sponsor activity you get the sense is driven by some kind of tax motivation given all the talk about the potential for rising taxes? Thanks. David Solomon : Sure. And I am going to answer the second \u2013 I am going to answer the second part first. And then I\u2019ll circle back on the Executive Order and kind of the broader \u2013 the broader roadmap around M&A. But I don\u2019t think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this point is a broad, diverse business. There is enormous dry powder.  There is an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem. There is real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase the waiting to alternatives. It\u2019s one of the reasons why the strategy we are focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that, because there is lots of demand for our clients.  And so, I don\u2019t think that there is any overlay from a tax perspective that\u2019s accelerating activity there. I do think that activity has accelerated, because the market environment is quite constructive and it\u2019s been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally. With respect to the broad M&A environment and anti-trust and the Executive Order, I mean, obviously, the Executive Order I think serves the roadmap for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next four years that relate broadly to competition, consumer protection issues. This is \u2013 it\u2019s a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It\u2019s something that I think we\u2019ll have to watch very, very closely. Ultimately, the order can\u2019t direct the agencies that make the anti-trust decisions to make those decisions. But it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact.  But the agencies will have to over time, put forward or through the actions they take create more transparency on that. We\u2019ll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I think there is a tipping in the balance that could in the margin have some impact on certain transactions.  I\u2019d certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation. There will certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I think it\u2019s early and I think you have to watch it closely and I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment, some of the things I said earlier about companies\u2019 desire is to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we are going to have to watch that very carefully. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color, David. And then, for my second question, there has been a lot of press coverage recently around junior banking \u2013 junior banker frustration, and we\u2019ve seen some competitors increase comp for the junior levels as a result. Do you think any of those developments will impact retention at Goldman? And do you have any specific plans or intentions to respond to this development yourselves? And what kind of impact do you think that might have? Thanks. David Solomon : Sure, sure, sure Brennan. I appreciate the question. And as we\u2019ve highlighted earlier in the call, we are quite proud of our leading Investment Banking franchise. It\u2019s been a leading franchise for decades and I think one of the primary reasons it\u2019s been a leading franchise is because of the quality of the people that we are able to attract and retain at Goldman Sachs, we serve our clients and serve our clients extraordinarily well.  We have always paid very competitively. We have always been a pay-for-performance organization. We are performing. We have a normal pay cycle. For analysts that normal pay cycle happens to be in August and we\u2019ll continue to pay competitively and pay-per-performance, but that\u2019s part of our strategy that\u2019s been in place for a long time and will obviously continue. With respect to salaries, we revaluate salaries in regular course every single year and when appropriate, we make sure our salaries are competitive. So, we continue to thrive by having the best people here and paying them appropriately especially when we perform, we are performing. And I would tell you to expect to see us pay appropriately during our normal cycle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. David Solomon : Hey, Mike. Stephen Scherr : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : So, it looks like revenues and profits per employee are up over the last year, last five years, even while you\u2019ve grown employees 4% year-over-year and 17% over five years. So, I think what would be sustainable is if you are lowering unit cost and generating revenues for lower marginal costs. So my question is, how much has technology helped you to lower unit cost? And how much more is ahead?  And from the outside, there is no way we can compute that. You have private equity gains. You have a lot of moving parts. But on the inside of the firm, I imagine you are tracking those in some manner. David Solomon : I\u2019ll start and Stephen will add, Mike. But at a high level - and we\u2019ve talked about this. We\u2019ve talked about efficiency in the firm. We\u2019ve talked about digitization. We\u2019ve talked about connectivity to our clients and ways the technology can leverage our ability to serve our clients, all that continues.  And there is a significant investment going into that making the firm more efficient, but most importantly, levering our people\u2019s capabilities to better serve our clients. I think that we are in the third inning of that evolution. There is more opportunity. But there have been some real gains. And Stephen can probably quantify on some basis how we think about that. But I think there is a lot more opportunity for us to continue through digitization and the way we connect with our clients and the tools we use to create more leverage broadly. And so, we continue to be focused on that. Stephen? Stephen Scherr : Yes. Mike, the way we look at it and compute it is, we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of different work streams. Take risk for example, where there is mandatory production of tens of thousands of reports, either by regulators or consumption internally and we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward. When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtue of the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of these businesses, take Transaction Banking, take the Consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we\u2019ve got an embedded base that is built to scale.  And those businesses will scale over time, over the medium to long-term and the effect of unit cost, if you will of producing what we do will come down. And so that\u2019s just a sense both in the spot, zero-based budgeting, risk, et cetera, but equally on the forward in terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business. Mike Mayo : And as it relates to the Executive Order from the White House with you guys positioned as a potential disruptor in the Consumer business, what do you make and what are the possibilities for you to benefit from making it easier to transport customer data from bank-to-bank? Stephen Scherr : Well, I would say couple of things. I mean, one is to repeat what David said, which is, it\u2019s a bit early. Right, now what we came to the issuance of the Executive Order is to exactly how that plays, okay? From our perspective, we started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper. So we are not retrofitting a series of transactions or incumbent businesses.  And so, as we look to continue to build the consumer platform, we are quite open to the notion that there will be shared set of data. The data will be portable. Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want? What is the customer need in the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform? And so, these products are all about the design, utilization of data.  We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren, which is, we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We are no different than any other bank. We take that responsibility seriously. But I think on the new build, on a white sheet of paper, we are less burdened by these issues, less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it and where we can build. David Solomon : Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, Mike, is that, when we started building this business four, five years ago, it\u2019s certainly within our vision of the world that customers would have a lot more flexibility to move their data and attach to different platforms. And so, certainly in our macro design of where we think the world is going, the direction of travel that way is not something surprising to us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a bit of an update on the expense efficiency initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out and kind of where the progress sits today and the breakout of kind of non-comp versus comp on a go-forward basis.  And then secondly, if you could also update us on the funding optimization goals that you have, I think the goal of 30 basis point improvement over time. Can you just update us on where that sits today? Stephen Scherr : Yes, sure. Okay. So let me take the three pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that and you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the 2022 timeline that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion.  So confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people. And so, that\u2019s where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives. In terms of comp and non-comp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we have always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We\u2019ll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent.  I will say, as we said in the past on compensation, that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scale businesses. And so, therefore, you\u2019ll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather pre-occupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself.  That\u2019s lesser reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It is more to do with the composition of businesses that we are building and the kind of non-comp intensity of expenses related to it. On non-comp expense, I would say, we have in virtually every one of the recent quarter has been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is, our non-comp expense normalized for kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top-line of the firm. So this quarter, as I noted, while the as reported non-comp expense is down about 43%, that\u2019s influenced very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it like-for-like, our non-comp expense is up 6% against the 16% top-line revenue growth. I think that should be a guidepost for how we are going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward. On the third question you asked about funding optimization, here I would say, we are \u2013 we remain committed and confident in the achievement of the $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about increased non-deposit funding or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up. It\u2019s going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm and as much as we grow non-bank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We are doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before. It\u2019s indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so, we are confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to $1 billion of runrate savings within the timeframe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning, David, and Stephen. David Solomon : Hey, Devin. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Devin Ryan : Wanted to quickly follow-up on Transaction Banking and just trying to better understand some of the traction just given such strong growth in the quarter. And what I\u2019d like to dig in a little bit is around, the 300 clients that you mentioned, do you have any kind of the wallet share that you are seeing?  And what I\u2019m getting at is, are clients I guess currently just testing your platform, and so there is kind of maybe significant embedded potential as those clients move more balances over? So, any flavor for that? And then, there seem to like success is going to beget more success here as proof-of-concept has obviously been established.  And so, just any other color on kind of what you are seeing in the sales process and then whether there is an acceleration in bringing new customers on now that it\u2019s fully established? Stephen Scherr : Sure, Devin. So, I would say, the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated, but the way in which it\u2019s happening is as we anticipated, which is that, we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There is a longstanding corporate relationship that has opened the door.  We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business, we recognize that there was a progression where you have large corporates that have a platform of three or four participating banks that our breaking point was to be number three or four and this wasn\u2019t conditioned on us jumping to the number one spot on that platform out of the box. Now, my view is that, as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the Transaction Banking platform and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow.  If we began at three or four, we\u2019ll see ourselves to two and perhaps one. And that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm so that sell-through is, as we expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth and that\u2019s kind of the progression. I would also say that that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that we will see, because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business, percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational. Therefore more valuable.  And so, that I think is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client. Devin Ryan : Okay. Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. David Solomon : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on your outlook around your mid-teens ROE target. You\u2019ve talked, David, and a lot about the revenue durability and reducing the capital density, both of which should eventually be accretive to the ROE profile. But when you look at how the market values the stock today, I think there is some skepticism around where the ROE could be if there is a downturn in the cycle. Just talk to us, if you could, in your view, where do you think the firm is over-earning versus under-earning from an ROE standpoint? And what\u2019s the net-net outcome of those jobs? David Solomon : Well, I think broadly speaking, we are performing very well across a very, very diverse platform of businesses. Certainly, I can\u2019t predict the future. This certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-a-vis the levels of activity we are seeing today.  On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our business that performed quite well and have some counter-cyclicality. So, I think we have a big at scale business. We are at scale and a number of our businesses and a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very, very good returns.  I think we are building other businesses that as Stephen highlighted are going to be scaling. Some of them are different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent modelable, more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so, I believe if we continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we are going to continue to focus on serving our clients, growing these businesses, expanding the platforms and my belief is the market will follow. Stephen Scherr : I mean, to some extent, if you reflect on David\u2019s comments, ROE is nothing, but numerator over denominator. And so, we\u2019re controlling both revenue in-take and expense in the context of the numerator and equally working hard to do what we can of our own volition to reduce down the denominator in the context of SCB.  But, the reality is, we sit where we sit. We are changing kind of the dynamic of the business profile all to yield a higher ROE, which will translate, as David suggested into the potential for a much better look at the valuation of the firm overall. David Solomon : And I just add broadly, the kind of environment that obviously affects our returns, certainly when you look historically, it\u2019s affected other of our peer institutions\u2019 returns too. There are differences in our business. But I don\u2019t think they are as different as they are amplified from time-to-time. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just as a follow-up on the consumer strategy. Can you achieve significant scale over the next few years without doing something inorganic? Or do you think you can build out and without having to do any meaningful M&A and still create a sizable business in a reasonable timeframe? David Solomon : We absolutely think that we can build an at-scale business over the course of the next three to five years without doing something on organic. If we saw something that we thought could accelerate that or enhance that, we\u2019d certainly consider it. But we have a detailed plan that gives us what we think is a scalable, which is an at-scale significant business over the next five years.  And we are going to continue to invest and continue to execute against it. And as we\u2019ve said a number of times, those investments and that drive to do that is not affecting our either mid or slightly longer-term return targets and thresholds that we continue to drive towards. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor : Good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Matthew O\u2019Connor : So, there has been an acceleration of the electronification effect. There was a good article, I think over the weekend on this specifically within credit. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit about this. And I know you\u2019ve invested a lot in the technology side on both sides of trading. But how does this kind of shape up for you in terms of thinking about your share going forward assuming this trend continues. Stephen Scherr : So, in the context of our credit business in FICC, this has been an area of considerable investment from a technology point of view, because we needed to and wanted to migrate from what was kind of high-touch to low-touch and pick up high volume lower margin business.  And so, portfolio trading algos, the introduction of them, the development of digital platforms where asset managers, insurance companies can come and execute on those platforms using marquee has been a very, very significant and somewhat elevated prospect for us in terms of overall performance. It\u2019s also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies.  It\u2019s all in the context of where a client of the firm can come either through marquee or otherwise and through an API use data and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute. And that is a growing piece of the overall credit business in FICC and an area where we think that there is enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow. And so, we are seeing monthly users around marquee accelerate. API interaction accelerate. All in the context of kind of the underlying premise to your question. Matthew O\u2019Connor : And then, just following up on FICC, I know it\u2019s always annoying when you get asked about like near-term trends. But we\u2019ve seen some unusual activity in rates in the last month with the move down, especially the longer run. We\u2019ve seen some correction in certain areas of commodities. Has this caused clients to reposition, like change views and driving more activity or most clients view thinking specifically on rates I guess that it\u2019s more temporary and not doing a lot of repositioning with the move we\u2019ve had? Stephen Scherr : Well, I think, volume intake in ERP has been reasonably volatile, meaning, we\u2019ve seen around certain rate cross currents and the overall debate around inflation, permanent or transitory expressing itself in increased client activity in ERP and then moments of a more muted activity. So ERP has been in both places over the last several months. In the Commodities business, I would say that, we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients. So for example, our business used to be in Commodities, almost 50% oil. And now, oil is more like 20% and we see greater product dispersion across gas, power, metals and Ags. I think that\u2019s good for our business and it reflects our reaction to - as I say, an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of product sets within Commodities itself. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Stephen. David Solomon : Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Stephen, you touched on in your opening prepared remarks about you are positioned well for loan growth accelerating going forward, can you give us some additional color on where you see this loan growth materializing possibly over the next six to twelve months? Stephen Scherr : Yes. So, let me talk a little bit about where we\u2019ve seen loan growth now, because I think it\u2019s reflective of the forward. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It\u2019s a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that\u2019s created by virtue of meeting the borrowings.  And this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that\u2019s borrowing. We\u2019ve seen more lending in the context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are. In Global Markets, we\u2019ve seen ourselves and I mentioned this in Mortgages around Warehouse Financing. So this is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what\u2019s there. So, the positioning I\u2019m speaking about is, both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeves in which we\u2019re lending, and perhaps more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in, in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up question, you\u2019ve all seen and we\u2019ve all seen that the reverse repo market has grown dramatically since the first of the year, in fact in less three to four months the Fed in fact raised the rate that they pay on those reverse repos by up to five basis points. Can you guys share with us your insights, what the implications are of what\u2019s going on in the plumbing, if you will of the financial system here in the states with quantitative easing reverse repos? And how that might be affecting or impacting favorably your trading businesses? Stephen Scherr : Well, look, any time there is kind of a differentiated view on rates or the markets broadly, as David mentioned, that tends to bleed to a positive outcome for our business more broadly in Global Markets, meaning, to the extent that there is greater volatility, greater activity at wider bid offer spreads, it\u2019s a positive outcome in the overall performance of our business.  Hard for me to give you specific judgments on what\u2019s happening specifically as it relates to the transmission of what\u2019s going on in TRS relating to the revenue in the business itself. But I would say that it portends a positive for our business in the context of overall client activity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital management from here and how we should think about pace of buybacks, et cetera. You guys have about 100 basis point cushion over your SCB. I guess, 40 basis points on the SLR. Can you maybe just refresh us on what your management buffers you are targeting? How to think about the dynamic going forward between just balance sheet growth, loan growth versus what you are trying to do on the buyback side? David Solomon : Sure. So, first on SCB and SLR. SCB is more binding to us than SLR. We don\u2019t view SLR as being a binding constraint much as we obviously watch it and maintain an adequate buffer around it. But SCB is more binding than SLR. As it relates to SCB, we have long said that we maintain a 50 to 100 basis point buffer - management buffer above our minimum. I see no reason to sort of change that view. We do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool, but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it. Actually, during the second quarter that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were momentarily capital consumptive to buffer enabled us to do that and engage.  Just one obviously factual point which is we are at 13.6 under SCB for this the third quarter. We go down to 13.4 in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent CCAR outcome. As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is, we\u2019ve obviously taken the dividend up reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm and we look to deploy capital at returns and if they continue to demonstrate mid-20% return on equity, you will see us continue to deploy capital in that direction.  To the extent that that falls off for whatever reason, we will take up our share repurchase in that regard. But you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter. This is really a question of whether it moves up or down and that\u2019s a function of the kind of return opportunities that we see. Jim Mitchell : So you \u2013 I mean, just so we have a good understanding. It\u2019s a saying, it\u2019s going to be pretty dynamic quarter-to-quarter in terms of what pace of buyback if you see an opportunity you\u2019ll do it and then vice versa? David Solomon : That\u2019s precisely right. Yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you. Good morning. Just one quick follow-up, please. You talked about regulatory investigations around Archegos. You said it\u2019s too early to know the outcome. But are you seeing other firms pulling back in prime or in equities more broadly as a consequence of the Archegos situation? Is that any part of the market share gains that you\u2019ve been seeing? Stephen Scherr : Well, hard to tie point A to point B. But you\u2019ve obviously seen open expressions by other firms who are looking to reduce down their prime business. We are going the other way. We want to grow that business. But as I say, we are growing that business with every element of prudence as to pricing and term structure and alike. But I suspect clients in motion around prime are coming to Goldman Sachs as they are to others and we are looking to sort of grow that business more broadly. Jeremy Sigee : Okay. Thank you. Stephen Scherr : Sure. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. David Solomon : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you again in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 15, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr, and our incoming CFO, Dennis Coleman (ph). With that, let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. I'm joining you today from California, where we have been hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders + Innovators Summit. We bring together over a 100 of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies. I've heard from a number of them that they are extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in California. In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with clients, and then the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing. This quarter, we announced two acquisitions. A key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor Day in 2020, centered around diversifying our business mix towards more recurring revenues and durable earnings. There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans. And now, we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. First, in August, we announced the acquisition of a leading European asset manager, NN Investment Partners. The addition of $320 billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our asset management platforms, enhance our distribution network on the continent, and bolster our ESG capabilities. On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepare to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP26, I would like to underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth. And we're making progress towards our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals. My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And given the fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face. Our second acquisition was GreenSky, which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to build the consumer banking platform of the future, that provides our consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants and a secularly growing market, that's a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform. And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale for recurring fee-based in net interest income revenues. Importantly, these customers will be our customers. They will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives. Turning to Page 1 of our presentation. We produced net revenues of $13.6 billion, driven by year-on-year increases in three of our four business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over $17.5 billion are higher than any full-year results in our history, and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROT of over 27%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. In Investment Banking, we produced our second highest quarterly revenues. Our clients who are extremely active, they turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels. We delivered solid results in global markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions. In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients, raising $90 billion against our goal of a $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day. And in Consumer Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong long-term fee-based inflows in the first nine months of the year, and as big client wins in Ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million customers to spend, borrow, and save on a multi-product platform. All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on our clients, and relentless execution of our strategy strengthened my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn to Page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but there is increasing uncertainty around a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative, and equity markets are still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic's effects on the global economy. And as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus. That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short-term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty around the Delta variant. Third, there is ongoing political debate in the U.S. over economic policy, including the potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases. And fourth, the U.S.-China relationship remains complicated. Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth. As further indicated by the downward revision in our economists, U.S. GDP expectations earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our differentiated advise and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in Investment Banking and we have solid momentum in our Asset Management client business. Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly three decades of service to the firm. I've had the privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last 20 years. In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, 25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, which held numerous leadership positions with an Investment Banking, most recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. He and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you, David. Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders, and the analyst community over the past three years as CFO. And I am committed to facilitating a smooth hand off to Dennis, who, as Carey noted, who's joined us on the call today. On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on Page 4. I'm pleased to start with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second-highest quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in Investment Banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 32%. M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and healthcare, and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market. Underwriting results were strong notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals, that represents volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were 726 million dollars with performance supported by solid, high yield, and investment-grade issuance, as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A announcements, and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our investment banking backlog, nonetheless ended the quarter, significantly higher than year-end levels. Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle-market lending, and the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In transaction banking, we achieved our 5-year goal of $50 billion in deposits this quarter well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion. Moving to global markets on page 5. Segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-year, driven by healthy client activity, notably in equities and a generally supportive market-making environment characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. Results were also supported by recent market share gains across FICC and equities. Global markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost. Turning to page 6, our FICC business is generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit, and mortgages offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of the quarter with September proving to be a very strong month, our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas, and power. Fixed financing revenues of 513 million dollars were the best in over a decade. And we're up meaningfully, driven by mortgage lending consistent with our strategy. Total equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash, and record equities financing, as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients. Moving to Asset management on page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment. Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private investment portfolio, plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions, which by contrast, were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our CIE portfolio. Staying with asset management, page 8, again, provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage region, and where relevant accounting treatment. On page 9, we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020 Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions. Moving to page 10, Consumer and Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Management, very strong long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which was 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year. Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds. Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12% with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion sequentially. It's demand for lending products remains high amid the low rate environment. I would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates, as well as the strong credit standing of this client base. Consumer banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022, given the pending acquisitions of GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product shed. Looking across these two segments, page 11, shows our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees. We've been building these businesses steadily, and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion, putting us in the top five of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven higher firm-wide management and other fees, which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion. On page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the third quarter higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $143 billion up $12 billion sequentially, reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected portfolio growth. On page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of 6.6 billion dollars. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance culture, and investing for growth. Our year-to-date non-compensation expenses were down 17%, but up 11% ex-litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Turning to capital on Slide 14, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation, the decline was driven largely by a $43-billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns, and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Additionally, we announced two acquisitions that will enhance both our asset management and consumer businesses, and increase the firm's recurring revenue stream. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set, remains attractive across the firm. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we are building towards a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Stephen, I wonder if I could ask a quick follow-up question on your comments just now on capital. So you make a ton of money, book is up 21% year-on-year, amazing. You did the GreenSky and NNIP deals, but RWA was up because activity is strong and SACCR is coming.  So I wonder if you could just peel back the onion a little bit more and just talk about where you see your excess position now and if at the margin we should be expecting continued investment in, say, the digital consumer builds at the margin, more so than the buybacks side. Thanks. Stephen Scherr : Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that, especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it's that the reason and consistent with that, that we deploy the capital in the business.  I'd also point out that, in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2 a share, up from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive will return capital backend that that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase. Now in terms of the opportunity set, you referred into the consumer business, it's unquestionably a priority. David had reflected time and again, the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm. But I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity, it is a broad look across the firm. And we think always about how do we add in an agile way, deploy capital across the whole of the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against anyone in particular.  Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore, surplus is less. And we, consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be in effect a petition on capital that we know. SACCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on implementation, and we'll let our regulators know when we do.  We're looking forward to that. And our view is that, when we put SACCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis points. It is at that level in part because, as we look back when SACCR was finalized by Basel in '14 and adopted by the Fed in '18 and '19, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect.  So the implementation now reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it, as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuing through the rules could play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement, so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now, relative to what it would've been. And so -- sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital. Glenn Schorr : That was comprehensive. I appreciate it. Take notes then. One last follow-up because year-to-date revenues are up 42% and so strong, you made a ton of money. Comp dollars accrued are up 34%. I wonder if we could talk about that a little bit in terms of comp leverage, I know it's a bottom-up and I know a lot of people at Goldman Sachs are killing it at this year. But I think 1MDB impacted things last year. So just thinking full-year to full-year comp ratio, anything on the puts and takes on what to expect? Stephen Scherr : So maybe I start with the numbers and then I'll turn it to David, who I think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy generally. But where we are right now, comp to net revenue, net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through nine months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. We always reserve for compensation, consistent with what's required of us, which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance, as at that date, obviously, there's a quarter to go. So we're at a 31% ratio, revenue net of provision for credit loss. You can see through nine months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the two numbers, that number is up 34%. Again, reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly. That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of provisions up 56%.  So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process. I think overall, if you look at total operating expenses because we look at it that way, including our non-comp expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business. Again, revenue is up 42%, but total operating expenses ex-litigation are up 24%. And so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically. But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy. David Solomon : Glenn, I appreciate the question. I know one of the things you're getting at. There is no question, there is comp pressured, there's wage inflation everywhere at all aspects of every business right now, we're extremely focused on it. We are pay-for-performance culture, and there is no question that people are performing.  But we're very, very comfortable that we're managing this in a way where we can show real operating leverage to our shareholders given our performance, and at the same time, pay our people exceptionally for the exceptional performance. And we're on top of that. We feel good about it. Glenn Schorr : Thank you, both. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David, Stephen, and welcome, Denis. Firstly, just to echo David\u2019s sentiment about Stephen. Congratulations and definitely will be very big shoes to fill for sure. So my first question here is on the digital consumer bank. That business continues to do very well. I think year-to-date, revenue growth is an impressive 30%, but that's still lags some of the pure-play neobanks out there.  And some of that might just be a function of product holes, I think a checking payment functions and investment functions, and Marcus, a little bit light. So curious here how you think about the product roadmap from here, from Marcus. The potential to use M&A to fill some of those gaps. And then longer-term, how should we think about sort of sustainable revenue growth for that business? David Solomon : Sure. I'll start and Steven may add some comments, but we -- this is -- Christian, this is something that we're focused on over the long-term. I think we've built an excellent platform from a standing start of a 0. In five years, we felt a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small marketing budget, a customer acquisition costs.  The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient, vis-\u00e0-vis the other models. We have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships, but also have the opportunity for proprietary card that's in development.  We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And was highlighted in the starting comments, their tech platform, their cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're doing.  And so we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business. We have a long-term view with it. I am not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage, unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model. We're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow and we will do that. I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added. Stephen Scherr : Well, the only thing I'd add, Christian, is if you just look at the year-over-year comparison, right? So you can't forget that we went through kind of a more challenging period in COVID, where we by design look to limit the amount of underwriting we were doing. We're now coming back to sort of turn that back on, having seen the portfolio performed very well. So year-over-year, revenues and consumer are up 23% in the deposit line. They're up 54% in credit cards. And that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform. And I think David's comments are spot on.  If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card, soon to be joined by General Motors, investing module and checking, this is net -- what's coming into focus is a big, broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs, as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set. And I think we're at a key moment now with the acquisition of GreenSky to sort of take that forward. Christian Bolu : Great. Thank you. My second question maybe is on, back to trading a bit of a high -- high, high-class problem here but the results are just another quarter of market share gains in the trading businesses. But the share gains have been so dramatic over the last few years that one has to wonder how sticky it could be going forward. Just curious how you think about sustainability of share gains in trading business as we roll into 2022 and 2023. David Solomon : Well, Christian, I appreciate your focus on the share gains. I don't -- I think it's a really important part and highlight of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out when we went back to Investor Day. And so I think there are a couple of things we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business. And I think the accruing results that will be quite sticky. And I don't want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't, we know that. But we've positioned the business much, much better for I think 2 principal reasons. Number 1, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric one GF culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way.  The business has been less transactional, more long-term focused on the client relationship and the level of client service, while bringing to bear the market-making, provisioning, and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business, and it's accruing the market share gains, it's benefiting us in that context. Number 2, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our financing capability across both equities and SEC, and we succeeded on that, and that's a place where we've taken market share. And that is more durable share, obviously.  And we continue to think there are opportunities that, we can continue to prosecute on -- on the financing side. And that's different. I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the tech necessity, have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players.  And so we're benefiting from that also. Now there's no question, this is a very conducive environment the performance in that business, and we're not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made, certainly takes us a step function up from where we were in 2019. I'd also say as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so even if we went back to a different level or at a higher hurdle return rate and the business at lower levels, and so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Stephen Scherr : Hey, good morning. David Solomon : Morning. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question. It's [Indiscernible] multifaceted one on just the sponsors and the alternative space. Sponsors have been really a significant and clearly growing contributor to increase M&A activity these last 12 months, you guys have certainly benefited from that. With [Indiscernible] with unique perspective into the business, just given you're building out your own third-party alternatives platform. And you cited some really impressive fundraising numbers. I was hoping you could just speak to how much longer this frenzy pace of both fundraising and deal activity could persist, and whether there are any factors we should be watching, whether it's tax reform or higher rates that could potentially derail some of the momentum? David Solomon : Sure. And I'll try to talk at a high level about something Steve, and I think you're right. We're at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high. First on fundraising, I just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago in a much more organized way, growing our third-party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform, is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives. And you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments sovereign wealth funds or broad institutions. All of them or broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives. I think, in addition, there's no question that we're in a position -- the world is in a position where retail participation to wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space.  And so there's more access being offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra-wealthy individuals, but that access is broadening more significantly. And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well-positioned for that, and so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted.  With respect to deal activity there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when sponsor activity has increased, it won for a while, but then ultimately it will be something that it facts it off. We're watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about risk management around that. It feels at the moment, given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the reacceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic, that this will run for some while. But that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace. We'll certainly be speed bumps along the way. Steven Chubak : Thanks, David for all that color. And maybe just for my follow-up, a question Steven, just on equity investments and the impact to capital. And one of the primary drivers of future SCB reduction, which you've talked about is the harvesting of those equity investments. We know they've got very punitive treatment in C-car.  And this is a high-class problem, shrinking the investments at least on a net basis, has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that $20 billion level. How much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your SCB? And is that 13% to 13.5% CET1 target still the appropriate long-term boggy just given some of the stubbornly high equity investments that persisted for the better part of a couple of years now? Stephen Scherr : Sure. Let me start with the end part of your question. Our strongly held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right place for this firm to operate. Now, our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands. Meaning, we're not waiting for petitions to be well received in order that the requirement comes down. But instead, we're pivoting and moving from Balance Sheet into fun format. I think, if you look at the page 9 in our -- in our deck what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions, and what that has meant for AE free up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. In the last 9 months, we've seen reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE.  Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE. And we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8 billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE. I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on, that will continue.  And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day we would experience a bit of a canyon, if you will, of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace. Faster slope than what might have been a yawning line, if you will, to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening. As David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising, which -- and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS, which is fee-paying. And so that transition is being managed well. And this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Jeff Harte : Good morning, guys. Stephen Scherr : Hey, Jeff. David Solomon : Good morning. Jeff Harte : So Balance Sheet growth has stepped up since the pandemic and it's something we kind of been waiting for since the great financial crisis. Can you talk a bit about how much of that growth has really been driven by client demand for Balance Sheet, which would be a good thing versus just being a function of kind of QE in the flood of -- of liquidity in the market? Stephen Scherr : Well, I would say that much of the balance sheet growth that has gone on has been attributed to client activity. If you just look at segment-by-segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our M&A franchise. You look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and equities that were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability on the forward in our trading business. And so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients. I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation. Meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place, capital has obviously grown, liquidity maintained at the firm, obviously grows in the form of our GCLA. And so all of these I think are meant to be read in tandem. In the context of serving clients. But doing that in a way, where Balance Sheet growth is, held in the context of various risks. Be it capital and liquidity profile of the Firm itself.  We're not a bank, notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks. And that is inflating Balance Sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation, frankly in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very usable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding. Jeff Harte : Okay. And as we think about the kind of recurring question for a number of quarters now, of capital markets and how sustainable are these really strong activity levels, understanding that you can't predict and things could shut off tomorrow. How do you think about things like Investment banking and global markets when you look at the budgeting process into next year and maybe the year beyond? I mean, how do you approach that? What's your outlook from that perspective? David Solomon : I think our outlook, there are confluence, the things Jeff that are going on that are obviously quite accommodative for this. You're right, at any point in time, that mix could change and we wouldn't see the same robust amount of client activity. But we have fundamental growth. In markets, we have fundamental growth and economic activity around the world. And that over periods of time grows long-term growth in these business platforms.  So I certainly would say we were running at very, very robust capital markets activity in the investment banking franchise at the moment. But I'd also say whenever things slowed down or rebalance a little, we're going to find that these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were five years ago because of the growth in market capital world and the growth in economic activity in the world. And so we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity. There's real correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow. But we have lots of flexibility in the context and the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think will continue to be strong performers even in different environment, they just might not perform at this level all the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Stephen Scherr : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey. So we talked a little bit earlier about market share and market share opportunities. I just wanted to take a slightly different angle on that and ask the question about where you think you're punching below your weight, if we could think about that being an opportunity from a regional perspective. So especially in Europe or Latin America, maybe Asia, you could speak to where you think you have opportunities in those regions. Thanks. David Solomon : I mean, I point to a couple of things at a high level, Betsy, there's no question. One of the reasons why NN was really attractive to us is that in our asset management business, we've been punching below our weight across Europe, both in terms of the assets that we were supervising, but also on our distribution capabilities and accelerates that. I still think there's more opportunity there.  I do think around some of the public portion of our GSAM business across the world. There's still opportunities for us to punch with a better way, even though at this point, we're one of the top five active Asset managers. And so we continue to think about that as an opportunity. I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business, in particular in Europe and we've been focused on that. I think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the U.S. as we move from simply managing money with ultra-high net worth clienteles that have been our traditional PWN business to a more mass affluent structure in using digital technology and extending the use of Ayco.  China is another place where there's opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective, and you've seen we've announced our joint venture with ICBC, which we think is an interesting opportunity in that part of the world. And so those are a handful of things from a regionalized basis, I would highlight. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Stephen Scherr : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : I was wondering if you could just kind of mark-to-mark us on your Sachs successes or initiatives. As you mentioned, year-to-date growth and revenues is 2 or 3 times that of expenses, so you're getting the higher marginal margin. Now some of that's due to the bull market. You mentioned comp leverage, but then, how much of that is due to technology? So I guess, one way to phrase this question is by area.  So you have your new growth initiatives You mentioned digital deposits of a $100 billion transaction banking deposit was $50 billion. I think that's pouring the cloud. And then you have your legacy trading activities where I guess there's been a Stephen Scherr : lot of electronification than there is the rest of the Company, where I'm not really sure what the tech backbone is. So the question is, how much has the tech backbone contributed to that higher marginal margin for each the growth areas, trading and the rest of the firm? David Solomon : Well, I'll start, Mike, and Stephen I'm sure will have some things to add here, too. At a high level, we're spending significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on, to better connect to our clients, and to enable us obviously to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment.  But our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the Cloud for a variety of reasons, which I will highlight in just a second, I think it's something that we've been very focused on strategically and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path. Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build an [Indiscernible] technology, and Cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients\u2019 needs.  Rather than doing what I call is undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech bill that managed what was more traditional tech infrastructure. The cloud really provides low friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics, which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to connect with us.  And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of them, like transaction banking and some of the things we're doing on the market platform. And so there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. We know that the cloud is not for everything, and so there is some services, I give you an example like high-frequency trading that are better-served on-premise.  And so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment, and we also choose our partners in kind of a multi-cloud or what we call Poly Cloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients. So overall, we're in this journey.  That's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently. And I think we're getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy. But I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial clouds, so to speak, for some of our principal businesses. I mean, Stephen, would you add anything to that or do you want to quantify some things a little more? Stephen Scherr : Yeah, the only thing I'd add was a bit of quantification. So Mike, if you -- you heard me say before, our non-comp expenses, so excluding litigation to just looking at the core non-comp expense, year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at the gross expense that that represents, about a 1/3 of that increase is related to technology. So we're about a third of the increase of non-compensation expense in the firm through the first 9 months relates to technology. And this is spent all across the firm. so it's both in particular initiatives like consumer TXP McKee (ph) but equally, it's been broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm.  Cloud-based engineering is one that David brought to your attention. In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so, as an example, part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation, which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I just offer that to you, just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was otherwise describing. Mike Mayo : And just a follow-up, maybe digging deeper on our transaction banking. I have to be a little skeptical, but you did get your five-year target, as you said. And so, if you think about the cloud, cloud-enabled, cloud-native or I think in that case foreign in the cloud, can you just define really what that means? Is that the nirvana state of being in the cloud, the way you have transaction banking? And to what degree has that contributed to you getting your $50 billion? And by the way, does that $50 billion include any deposits from Goldman Sachs itself? Stephen Scherr : So I don't believe that there are GS deposits in it. It's 50 billion of gross deposits. And as we've said, that's now become about 25% operational, so a value to us. But just to come back to your question about the Cloud. So the TXP business was built entirely in the Cloud. I don't know that I would necessarily conclude that that is why it's been successful. I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a drop card in the context of it. The reason Mike is self-evident, which is that it's built-in the Cloud, as David noted, it's not built with multiple instances of the transaction banking platform across redundant datacenters.  It benefits without necessarily costing us to improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like. That is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself. So I can't tell you that I could draw a line to the deposits that have come in. I can tell you that we built it better, cheaper, and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client -attention and attraction to it. David Solomon : The one thing though -- one thing, Mike, that I want to add very, very clearly. the reason our transaction banking platform is I think accelerating and its success, is because the quality of the offering for our clients is differentiated and better meeting their needs than the existing offerings.  And part of the reason, as Steven highlighted, we could do that so quickly was because it's easier to build on the Cloud and transition. But fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform, that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded on our corporate clients. As a user of that activity, we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that that experience could be improved. And we've built a platform that delivers a better experience. And that's why it's succeeding. That's why it's meeting targets and continuing to grow. And that's why we're very optimistic. Stephen laid out few a billion dollars of revenue. We're confident in that target. And this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor. And so we're very confident about how we'll continue to execute. But fundamentally it's not the quality of the product we're delivering to our clients. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just congrats, best of luck to you, Stephen. Stephen Scherr : Thank you Brennan Hawken : And Dennis congrats to you also on the new role, looking forward to working together. Maybe we could start with the GreenSky acquisition. So the Firm, a lot of investors see how the stock has performed since the IPO pointed to spotty history and underwriting and the Firm began exploring strategic alternatives in August of 2019.  So could you maybe add your perspective on why this was the right franchise to connect your growing consumer banking business. And maybe what you think the market might not be appreciating or understanding about this Company that led you to be interested in acquiring it. David Solomon : Sure. I'll start here on that. And I appreciate the question, Brennan. But first, it's a very different Company as an independent public Company, than it is as a platform inside Goldman Sachs. And one of the big weaknesses of the Company as an independent public Company is it didn't have a funding model, and it had to fund differently. Inside Goldman Sachs, we have funding. An attractive funding that becomes a technology platform that allows us to connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the market's ecosystem. I think the merchant network that they develop, well over 10,000 merchants, and they developed over 15 years is extremely valuable.  And then the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that, we think it would have taken us close to ten years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that network, bringing very, very high-quality customer, these are customers that aren't homes, these are customers that have high FICO Scores, very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs.  It allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing. And so we feel very, very good about it. And we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20%+ returns on the activity that it generates. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks for -- thanks for that David. Maybe following up on that, could you provide some context around the strategic priorities from here. You've done 2 recent acquisitions, smaller both on size, but certainly a bit of activity. When you think about the different businesses in which you want to grow you've done a lot of these smaller bolt-on, some in the wealth side, with United Capital and Folio several years ago, at NN and G-Sky more recently.  Going from here, is there any particular business that you think is quite compelling, given either some combination of ripe inorganic opportunities that the market might be under-appreciating, similar to -- or your -- the platform can be different within Goldman than it is as a standalone, the way it was wit GreenSky. How should investors think about priorities and direction from here, and how they stack? David Solomon : Sure, Brennan. I will bring you back -- I really want to bring you back and center you to -- center you around what we said during our Investor Day. We laid out a strategy that said we will continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase of positioning. I think we've done that.  There's still some opportunities to continue to do that. But we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business. And when you look at those areas, it's transaction banking, it's asset management, it's wealth management, and it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all four of those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically, but when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take a hard look at it. As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there is still opportunities -- there may be opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas.  But we are focused on those 4 areas because those 4 areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess. First question -- just want to dig in a little bit on the Asset management and the opportunity on the third-party alternatives fundraising. And just the ability to continue to scale that both on the customer side and product side. And when we look at some of the, I guess stand-alone alternative manager peers, they've done a great job in recent years of expanding the product menu, and then consolidating LP relationships where they're connecting on numerous products, and so that effectively creates a network effect.  And so we're looking at Goldman, where do you guys feel like you are with LPs? And is the opportunity to add more LPs or is it bigger opportunity to connect with more Goldman Sachs product. And then I guess on the product side, alternatives, are there any areas where you feel like you could accelerate investment or those could be areas that could help you connect, I guess, with your existing LPs on more products? David Solomon : So when we -- when we -- I appreciate the question, Devin. It's obviously something strategically we've been very focused on. But I'll go back to some of the things that we said at Investor Day, that kind of geared our focus on this. We've been in these businesses for a long time, and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated and that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years.  We have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure, and we also have them globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that broad array, but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we are set up.  What was differentiated or different about our business and alternatives before we roll that together and got it focused, is generally our LP relationships, came through our private wealth network. And we've raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm, while we had some institutional LP relationships. We had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform.  And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a one-GS approach at really taking a long-term view and building relationships with those institutional partners, we could grow our partnership with them. So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our ecosystem. And if you look at strategic solutions, which we raised last year, there were a number of probably a dozen new significant institutional LP that the first time they were coming onto our platform was in that strategic solutions fund.  So I think it's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that, it's something we're very focused on. But the opportunity for us is less than product addition. Although we are at in products, we just raised the horizon fund, which is an ESG centered funds, will allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies. And we'll add other product capability that we think are interesting. But our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand [Indiscernible] institutional LLPs that are partnered with us. And I think we have a lot of upside to run on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Just one question. David. Adjust to us how you're thinking about just digital assets. As you're seeing the entire ecosystem being built around digital asset custody tokenization. Just give us a perspective because it feels like all of that would be writing Goldman's wheelhouse to capitalized as some of these things accelerate, so I would love to hear your perspective on one, how you see just that entire ecosystem developing and the role Goldman can play in that. David Solomon : Sure. So there's no question that activities that we're involved in are digitizing quickly. I think there is a meaningful acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring. There are places that, that digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position.  The two we've talked about a bunch today on this call that are happening because the digital infrastructure, our ability to do what we're doing in transaction banking, is taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way. What we're doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this. You know the broader -- digital ecosystem, I think it's an early stage as I think we're version 1.0 I think you'll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways that financial services are delivered and consumed.  I think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are remediated. I think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption, but I think we're very early in the game and I think it is a big opportunity for the firm and the firm continues to be focused on it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could just elaborate on, what drove the increase in RWAs from the regulatory guidance this quarter, please. Stephen Scherr : Sure. So we had about $42 billion increase in RWAs -- about half of that related to changes in the methodology that we're using in the computation of the RWAs. And that was the byproduct of just routine and ongoing discussion with regulators. And so that plays through in the third quarter ratio, will play through on the forward.  But that's really the source of about 50% of the RWA lift. The other 50% is obviously in the context of the overall business and risk and exposure that's attending there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hello, Steven. Hello, David. Stephen Scherr : Hey, Gerard. David Solomon : Hey Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Steph -- Stephen, can you share with us on -- you mentioned in the transaction backing you've got to the 50 billion in deposits, which is ahead of schedule, and you're still confident you're going to reach the $1 billion in revenues. Back in the Investor Day, when you gave us those numbers, were those numbers linked? Meaning were they supposed to kind of be achieved around the same time? And then second, when do you think you'll reach that billion-dollar target? Stephen Scherr : Sure. So the targets were set at the same time, though bear in mind the environment then and now is quite different in the context of interest rates. So we've seen fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day. I don't know, I want to say about a 150 basis points, maybe a little more.  The consequence of that is that, the value of deposits that the economic value of deposits is not as rich now, as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits, otherwise modeled out. And therefore on the forward rate curve our view is that we'll be able to achieve that billion-dollar revenue target. I point out that of the 50 billion more of them are operational. That's step one to achieving the value of that. And that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. And I think more broadly in transaction banking, about 2/3 of the revenue from the time we modeled through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come back, the value of those deposits will as well. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please, continue with any closing remarks. Stephen Scherr : So since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our Senior Management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth-quarter call in January. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me now pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Goldman Sachs delivered record results in 2021, and I am extremely pleased with our performance. We generated record full year revenues of $59 billion and record net earnings of $21.6 billion, over 60% greater than the previous all-time high. While our results were supported by healthy operating environment, we delivered the highest annual return among our peer set with an ROE of 23%. Our record annual revenues demonstrate that our client-oriented strategy is working. Investment Banking had an extraordinary year as clients remained incredibly active and turned to Goldman Sachs time and time again for our industry-leading M&A and capital markets advice and execution. In this business, where we have been the dominant M&A adviser over the last 25 years, we produced segment revenues that exceeded the previous record by over $5 billion. In Global Markets, we have set out to make this business more client-oriented and to improve its return profile. We've made great progress, and we now rank in the top 3 with 72 of the top 100 clients, up from 51 in 2019. And we generated a return of 15% for the year. Our Asset Management and Wealth Management business both had record years. We're advancing our strategy to expand our third-party alternatives platform where we are a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. In the last two years, we have raised over $100 billion in commitments against our five-year goal of $150 billion. We are keenly focused on growing this business, and we'll be updating our long-term goals. We are also proud to run the fifth largest active asset manager globally with assets under supervision of a record $2.5 trillion. During the year, we generated a record $130 billion in long-term net inflows across the platform. Despite our strong market position and inflows, we are on a path to grow our Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses further and drive higher fee-related revenues. Finally, I continue to be excited by our creation of the consumer banking platform of the future, where we are enabling over 10 million customers to take control of their financial lives. Last week, we introduced My GM Rewards card, and we look forward to the addition of GreenSky later this quarter and the launch of checking later this year. At our Investor Day in early 2020, we committed to do three things : grow and strengthen our existing businesses; diversify our franchise into new businesses; and operate more efficiently. As shown by today's results, we are delivering on these objectives underpinned by our relentless focus on our clients. Notwithstanding the solid progress we've made to date, we remain committed to driving this organization forward with a keen eye on growth and diversifying our business mix. These efforts will strengthen our ability to elevate the firm's return profile relative to before we took over as a leadership team. As I look ahead, we have great opportunities to grow the firm as we scale our four growth initiatives. We invested in these initiatives with the belief that each of them has the potential to add tens of billions of dollars to our market cap over time. Given it has now been two years since our Investor Day, we plan to address the details of the next phase of our execution next month. Before I turn it over to Denis, let me provide some thoughts on the operating environment. I'll start by saying there continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty. There's no question that the recent surge in Omicron cases contributed to market volatility. However, I'm encouraged by data that shows that Omicron wave is less severe and has already peaked in some countries. Therefore, it is expected to have less of an economic impact. My view is that COVID-19 will be endemic and as a society, we will find a way to live with it, supported by the efficacy of vaccines and new treatments. For our firm, this means being flexible and dynamic with our protocols to adapt to this new state of the world while also enabling the majority of our people to be back in the office safely. More broadly, there's no surprise that the recent surge in cases is putting even more pressure on supply chains. Inflation is persisting in many countries, and major central banks are beginning to raise rates. Notably, the Bank of England late last year and the Federal Reserve is now expected by our economists to implement four rate hikes in 2022. Based on my experience, it makes sense to coming out of the recent period of easy monetary policy, inflation may be above trend for some time. And in the near term, inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease. I also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound, which will likely have an impact on economic growth, asset prices and client activity. In such a dynamic environment, I want to reiterate the importance I place on investing in the people of Goldman Sachs. It is their tireless dedication to the firm, to our clients and our culture of collaboration that drove our record performance this year. And I want to take this opportunity to express my profound thanks for all their hard work. It remains a personal priority of mine that we invest in their success. In 2021, we demonstrated this commitment not only through our pay-for-performance approach but also by supporting our people in a variety of other ways, including new benefits and investments in health and safety. We believe these investments are critical components of our people strategy, support our culture, and position us for success in the long term. In conclusion, as I said at the outset, we had a very favorable backdrop in 2021, and we outperformed. But make no mistake, as we move into 2022 with excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead, we remain committed to executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders in any market environment. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the year and the quarter in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 2 of our presentation. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.6 billion, net earnings of $3.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.81. This contributed to our record performance for the year across revenues, earnings and EPS. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page 3. Investment Banking delivered outstanding results in 2021, with revenues rising almost 60% versus very strong results last year. In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced its highest quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were just shy of last quarter's all-time record. We maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A for 2021 as we have for 22 of the past 23 years and participated in over $1.8 trillion of announced transactions during the year, driving a volume market share of 31%. M&A activity remains elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT, industrials and healthcare. We are also optimistic around the forward outlook for M&A with continued strength and corporate confidence, coupled with an accelerated pace of transformation across industries. This is further bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. In equity underwriting, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally for the year with volumes of roughly $140 billion across more than 700 deals, representing volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $948 million, with our strong performance supported by record industry leveraged finance volumes as well as solid asset-backed activity. We start the year with an Investment Banking backlog that is significantly higher than where we started 2021, despite record revenues during the year. Moving to Global Markets on page 4. Segment net revenues were $4 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. Full year revenues of $22 billion rose 4%, driven by an increase in equities, which posted its best annual results since 2008. Equities performance was helped by our continued progress in deepening our relationships with the top 100 clients as well as higher financing revenues, consistent with our growth strategy. Turning to page 5. Our FICC business has generated $1.9 billion of net revenues for the fourth quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was largely the result of significantly lower revenues and rates, products amid lower market-making opportunities as well as in credit, primarily on decreased activity. These declines were partially offset by strong revenues in currencies on solid market-making results and as a divergence in global central bank policies led to higher client activity, particularly in emerging markets. FICC financing revenues of $559 million were up meaningfully year-on-year driven by mortgage lending balances, consistent with our strategy to support the financing needs of clients across the franchise. Total equity revenues of $2.1 billion were down 11% versus solid results in the fourth quarter of 2020 as an increase in equities financing was more than offset by a decline in intermediation. Average balances in prime rose to a new record though financing revenues of $819 million were lower sequentially in the absence of outsized opportunities to extend liquidity to clients, as mentioned last quarter. Equities intermediation revenues fell year-on-year, driven by significantly lower performance in both derivatives and cash amid fewer market-making opportunities. Moving to Asset Management on page 6. Fourth quarter segment revenues were $2.9 billion. And for the full year, Asset Management generated record revenues of $14.9 billion, helped by significant gains in equity investments, particularly in the first half of the year. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $739 million, which were burdened by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. As rates rise in the U.S., we expect the majority of these waivers to cease. Equity investments produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, driven by over $1.3 billion in gains on our $15 billion private investment portfolio and roughly $570 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $500 million of losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Moving ahead to page 8. We show the continued progress in harvesting on-balance sheet equity investments, consistent with our long-term strategy to reduce capital in this segment and increase fee-related earnings. Since we laid out this plan at the beginning of 2020, we have actively harvested positions of $18 billion, which have been partially offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $6 billion, which include early fund facilitation. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is nearly $10 billion. Additionally, we continue to have line of sight on $1.5 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $1 billion of capital reduction. Moving to page 9. Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing to record full year revenues of $7.5 billion that rose 25% versus the prior year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees rose to a record of $1.3 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter and 24% year-on-year, supported by strong client inflows. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $293 million for the quarter contributed to record full year results of $1.1 billion, which were helped by increased loan penetration with our ultra-high net worth clients. Consumer banking revenues were $376 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances year-over-year. Sequential results were impacted by higher interest expense on our UK deposits where we raised rates ahead of the Bank of England rate increase. As David mentioned, we now have over 10 million customers across our global consumer platform, up roughly 60% versus last year. And gross loan balances are up by almost 50%. We expect loan growth to continue in 2022, given the pending acquisition of GreenSky and the recent launch of the My GM Rewards card. Page 10 shows the growth in our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees, which is a key component of our forward strategy. As David mentioned, total AUS stands at a record $2.5 trillion, following record long-term net inflows of $130 billion during the year, strengthening our position as a top 5 active asset manager and a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. Firm-wide management and other fees for the fourth quarter rose 14% year-over-year to a record $2 billion, contributing to full year management and other fees of $7.6 billion. Importantly, we've been able to grow these fees at a 9% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This fee income is a key component of our strategy to diversify our business mix and deliver more durable revenues for shareholders. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses, including a greater reliance on deposits and an increase in interest-earning assets. As we've noted previously, our business is modestly asset-sensitive. We expect that higher rates in 2022, along with the continued expansion of interest-earning assets will provide a net benefit to our results. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $158 billion, up $15 billion sequentially and $42 billion for the full year. The growth in our loan book this year primarily reflects higher balances in conservatively structured warehouse lending, where our typical loan to value is 50% and an increase in high-quality wealth management loans. Provision for credit losses of $344 million reflected lending growth during the quarter, primarily in Apple Card, as we expand our consumer business. We expect the provision to grow next year, reflecting increased lending and financing activities across the firm. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.3 billion. For the full year, operating expenses were $32 billion, driving an efficiency ratio of roughly 54%, well below our 60% target, and reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment. Our full year compensation ratio net of provision of 30% is 200 basis points lower than 2020. Quarterly non-compensation expenses of $4 billion rose year-over-year as we continue to invest across the franchise to accelerate the strategic evolution of the firm. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was driven by higher professional fees, technology spend and market development-related costs. We also incurred $182 million of expenses related to litigation during the quarter. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and nearly $700 million in common stock dividends. We also adopted SACCR in the fourth quarter, which impacted our CET1 ratio by 30 basis points as noted on the last earnings call. Looking ahead, we expect further pressures on our capital position, including the upcoming closing of the NNIP acquisition and other deployment opportunities. Given these headwinds, we currently expect buybacks in the first quarter to be at or around the levels in the fourth quarter. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend to issue materially less benchmark debt for this year versus 2021, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, our solid fourth quarter and record 2021 results reflect the strength of our client franchise and our successful strategic execution as well as the upside inherent in our business model amid a constructive operating environment. As David noted, we look forward to providing you with an update next month with more detail around our strategic objectives and targets. Importantly, our results bolster our confidence that the execution of our strategic plan will diversify our business mix and drive more durable revenues for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. I'm trying to ask a question as efficiently as I can, [Technical Difficulty]. So, you know that the 200 basis points of [Technical Difficulty] provision operating leverage, but reviews were amazing. So, [Technical Difficulty] is as we think about comp ratio [Indiscernible] where someday capital markets revenues might actually moderate? And two, non-comp of 12%, how much of that sits around, so people can maybe guess this high level of [structure] (ph) relative to a high level of revenue? Thank you. Denis Coleman : Hi, Glenn. Denis here. Thank you very much for the question. I think I understood it. It was regarding compensation and also non-compensation expenses. And as you noted, for the full year, we were able to take the compensation ratio down by over 200 basis points, while still being able to have a level of compensation and benefits that we thought was appropriate in light of the firm's performance, taking into context the competitive environment for talent and also wanted to ensure that we had our team in place ready to continue to serve our clients and continue to execute on our plan as we go forward. To the extent that the environment in 2022 shifts, that compensation model is highly variable, and that is a lever that we can certainly pull to continue to deliver on our targets with respect to efficiency ratio as well as aggregate level of returns. I think, you separately pointed out that non-compensation expenses were up. And those non-compensation expenses were up as we continue to make investments in the firm. Some of the largest drivers of our non-compensation expense in the year were transaction-related activity. That is our largest non-compensation expense. And to the extent that activity were to vary and be different, we would expect those expenses to be different. Other drivers were professional fees and then also technology spend. And these are technology spend, in particular, technology spend and engineering expense is a strategic expense for the firm. That's one area where we expect to continue to invest. But we similarly have a number of levers across our operating expenses that should the environment prove different in 2022, we would look to make adjustments to. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : David, I was hoping you could speak to the tremendous growth that you've seen in trading revenues this year. It's also consumed a fair amount of capital. Standardized RWAs are up about 20% year-on-year. It's clearly been the right call to lean into those trading opportunities, just given the 15% returns generated in Global Markets. But if the industry activity contracts, can you speak to how we should think about the interplay between revenues and allocated capital and whether we should expect some RWA relief as activity normalizes? David Solomon : Thanks, Steve, I'll start and there might be some stuff that Denis adds. But I think the most important thing and you highlighted it and we feel very good about it, and I think it's one of the reasons why we were able to deliver 23% returns for the year is there was a client opportunity and an activity opportunity, and we allocated to it resources including capital and therefore, driving RWAs. In a different environment, if this normalized, we think we have the nimble ability to be reactive and adjust. We've always been relatively nimble in our capital allocation to the business. I think we made the right decision this year and captured a lot of upside and therefore a lot of book value growth. But in an environment where the market opportunity and the client opportunity was different, it would be reflected in changes in our balance sheet position and our RWAs. Listening to the first two questions, I just again highlight, we look through everything. This management team is looking through everything through the lens of the fact that we laid out a strategic plan two years ago to drive higher returns and invest in our businesses, grow certain platforms and run the firm more efficiently. When we had that Investor Day two years ago, none of us could have anticipated the environment that we've lived through over the last two years and particularly the environment this year, which was obviously a significant tailwind for our business. I think we've done a very good job being nimble and capturing the opportunity that existed because of the increase in client activity. But we, in no way see that as a permanent environment that's going to continue at this pace. We continue to be focused on doing exactly what we set out in the Investor Day to deliver higher, more durable returns. We're going to update you on what we think that looks like, but we remain very confident of what we set out at our Investor Day. I think there's more that we can do. And so obviously, if some of the market activity that we saw in 2021 dissipated in 2022, we would change our capital allocation, our RWAs and our expense base accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. David Solomon : Betsy, we can't hear you. Manan Gosalia : This is Manan Gosalia on for Betsy Graseck. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the collaboration you recently announced with AWS? What functionality does that give you on your platform? And do you think that that will drive more wallet share with existing clients, bring in new clients, or is it a combination of the two? David Solomon : Sure. And we continue to find more ways to migrate certain platforms to the cloud, which gives us more efficiency and ability to connect with our clients and deliver resources to our clients. This partnership with AWS allows us to take our data sets inside Goldman Sachs. And if you think about SecDB and all the trading data sets and information that we have inside. In the old model, clients come to us, we use that data and we give them feedback so they can transact. In the new model, we're allowing an ability for clients to connect directly into that so they can develop directly on that platform with our data sets, which will allow them to think differently about their execution decisions and priorities. There are different things that can happen from that. One, with certain very large clients, we've got direct feedback from those clients that that can improve our wallet share because we're delivering real value to them; and secondarily, we actually think there can be opportunities for people to pay for that as a service, given the size of our data set and the resources that we can deploy. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. And if I can ask an unrelated follow-up. You had a very strong quarter and year on the M&A advisory side. I know you said the pipeline is still strong across Investment Banking and you have a very positive outlook on M&A. But can you talk about how you expect the environment to evolve as the Fed starts to hike rates and as we get into the back half of the year? And are there any differences in how you see sponsor activity playing out versus strategic activity? David Solomon : Well, I think strategic activity is going to continue to be very high. And one of the things I touched on in my opening comments, we have a very, very interesting macro environment because you have all these supply chain disruptions. And I think those supply chain disruptions are real, having a big effect on business. And so, people are looking for opportunities to strategically accelerate in a changing environment. People are looking for further opportunities for scale. They're looking for further opportunities to consolidate. And that's one of the reasons why the activity levels across our M&A platform are quite active. And so both from a backlog perspective and real-time activity and just getting around with CEOs broadly, we think there's a good tailwind for continued M&A activity. And the uncertainty in the environment interestingly is actually helping that tailwind because it's forcing people to look hard at ways they can strengthen their competitive position. And so I think we have a big reset going on coming out of COVID around supply chains, the way businesses are positioned. And I think that's going to create a significant amount of client activity. Now, when you get back into the latter part of the year, you talk about different economic environments, it's very hard to see that far out. But at the moment, the M&A activity tailwind looks reasonably good. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Just a clarification, you said next month, we'll get an update. Will that be in the form of a brokerage firm conference or a special one-off Goldman Sachs event? Carey Halio : Mike, we'll put out a press release in the next couple of weeks with the details, Mike. Mike Mayo : Okay. Then to my questions. I guess, the first question is, conceptually, how do you think about taking the benefits of the higher level of revenues and reinvesting in the business? Certainly, your efficiency ratio improved from 65% to 54% year-over-year. But in the fourth quarter, it backed up quite a bit and more than expected. And so, trying to get a sense for how much you're willing to invest whether it's employees, technology, complete that list at the expense of showing positive operating leverage. David Solomon : Well, Mike, I appreciate the question. And again, I just want to take you back. We laid out a plan and we set some targets, and we are very confident of our ability to deliver on those targets. And we're going to provide more information based on what we know in the coming months as to how we think we're going forward. But, we're committed to that efficiency ratio target. And I said this clearly in my remarks, in any environment. And so look, this was certainly a very, very interesting year. And I feel very good about the fact that there was an enormous opportunity given client activity for us to capture more of that activity, make some investments around it and deliver really extraordinary returns and really extraordinary book value growth for our shareholders. In a different environment, I'm confident that there are a number of different levers that we can pull in that different environment to continue to deliver on the targets we set and make the firm more durable and continue to grow our returns. And so, we're focused on that. We're not wrapped up in the quarter. We're focused on our 1, 2 and 3-year version, a vision of how we can continue to drive the firm forward. And so I hope that's helpful. But that's the way we're thinking about it. That's what we're focused on. And there was an extraordinary opportunity this year, and we feel like we captured it. Mike Mayo : And then the tougher question but you're in a better seat to forecast this, how much longer should capital markets stay elevated versus pre-pandemic? And this is a relevant question because you're allocating resources. You said the backlog is close to the record level at the start of last year, but I think the concern is really around the markets businesses. And if you get more volatility, maybe that's good. On the other hand, maybe the best days are behind us. But with higher rates, do you get a lot of money moving in and Goldman Sachs acts as an intermediary? Just how do you think about the ins and outs as it relates to the capital markets levels? David Solomon : Sure. And look, I don't have a crystal ball, Mike. And so, there certainly could be volatility in activity levels, but I think the important thing is to step back again and think about our franchise. And I harken back to our Investor Day when we talked about our position in Global Markets, and we said we wanted to grow our wallet share. We wanted to increase the scalability of our client franchise. We wanted to be more important to our clients. We've materially grown our wallet share. We've materially increased our position, and there was definitely more client activity last year and this year, and so we were able to capture that. In a more normalized environment, that opportunity might be different, but we think we have the right resources to continue to be a leader and to capture what that puts forward and deliver reasonable returns against our overall package of returns as a firm. I do think that market levels and activity levels, given we're in a very, very unusual macro environment, are going to continue to be reasonable as we start into this year. I'm not going to predict what things look like in the second half of the year or next year, but you've still got a lot of volatility around the pandemic. You've got big changes in supply chain. You've got changes in interest rates. There's a lot going on. And so, we still see clients being relatively active. But what I feel best about is over the last two years, we've been executing on our plan. It strengthened our franchise. It's increased our wallet share. We're in better position with our clients. And so, -- and we've also done a lot from an efficiency perspective in that business. And so, I feel very good about how that business has progressed since we laid out our plan on Investor Day in 2019, and I expect we'll continue to perform well as we move forward from here. Operator : Your next question comes from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Kian Abouhossein : The first question is just coming back to the comp ratio. If I ex provisions on the comp ratio, I actually get to 30%, it's actually flat year-on-year. Can you just confirm that? And in context of comp, if I just take a simple calculation of taking comp increase minus staff increase, you're up around 20% year-on-year. And if I compare that to peers looking at nine months or what has been reported so far, it's 10% or less. So just trying to understand your driver to pay more than what we're going to see and what we expect to see from the Street in terms of global peers on the comp side. David Solomon : Okay. Thank you, Kian. A couple of comments I would make. You referenced the ratio without taking account of the provisions. And you're correct, that's roughly flat at 30% year-over-year. However, we look at paying out compensation on the basis of revenues net of provisions. These provisions are real. And that's the basis on which we set our compensation ratio. And 30% is more than 200 basis points lower than it was last year. It's also the lowest comp ratio in our history. So, we continue to drive that down, drive efficiency on behalf of our clients. You made some reference to changes in headcount. I mean something I would offer you up just by way of a perspective. If you look at the roughly 3,400 incremental heads that we have on headcount on a year-over-year basis, approximately 90% of those heads were located in strategic locations of the firm. Only 10% of those heads in hub locations like New York, London, Hong Kong. So, there's a lot of things going on as we continue to evolve the complexion of our employee base and grow the firm. And as a matter of efficiency and strategic priority in terms of sourcing talent and sort of redundancies around the world, we're very deliberately growing headcount in different places. And obviously, as you can appreciate, the expense associated with headcount varies very much by location. So, that may help you with your numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just curious about the -- some of the different lines in the new businesses, specifically the Consumer & Wealth segment and the corporate lending line. How should we think about rate sensitivity in those lines? Can you give us any kind of parameters around how we would calibrate magnitude given we're likely to see some rate increases here in the coming year? Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you, Brennan. It's Denis. And look, obviously, recognize we have a different business than some of our large commercial bank peers. But that being said, given our expectation for the rate environment, we see ourselves as remaining modestly asset-sensitive. We are focused on continuing to drive lending, increase our net interest earning assets. So, we would expect a benefit in that environment, in that context. I mean, the other thing I would point out to you, we mentioned in the script that with the first -- or I should say, with the first 25 basis-point rate hike, we would expect to be able to roll off the majority of our fee waivers, our money market funds. And just for context, that total number in 2021 was $565 million. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that, Denis. I appreciate it. Also, if I could just sneak in one more. You guys gave some great color around the non-comp. And clearly, there were some noisy items in the fourth quarter. But, when we think about building out our outlook into 2022 based on what you can see now, it seems like the environment is still solid. You've talked about good backlogs and whatnot, even though they're down a little sequentially, which is understandable. Should we -- is the 4Q backing out the charitable contribution and the litigation charge? Is that the right jumping-off point as we think about 2022, or should we make further adjustments? David Solomon : Look, so I think as we think about non-compensation expense on the forward and taking all of it in totality and again, all within the framework of our efficiency ratio, our return targets, et cetera, where we sit today, we don't see taking our operating expenses up materially from where they are right now. There will be puts and takes within the portfolio of expenses. And as is an item of consistent focus for the market and certainly for us, one area that you should expect us to continue to invest in is across technology and engineering expense. That number for us this past year was between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and that's a number that you should see us to continue to invest in. But across the balance of the portfolio, we'll make adjustments based on the environment. Operator : Your next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : I guess, first question here just on the M&A backdrop. David, I heard your comments loud and clear just around companies looking to kind of improve their strategic position. And so, when we think about, I guess, Goldman Sachs' M&A strategy, your firm has been reasonably active over the past couple of years here. And we are seeing a little bit of a reset in valuations, particularly in the fintech space. So, I know that price isn't the first consideration here. But are there any areas that with more maybe attractive pricing or more reasonable valuations that makes sense to get into through M&A versus organic build? David Solomon : Yes. So, Devin, I appreciate it. And my message here is going to be relatively consistent. We have these areas of the firm, in particular, asset management, wealth management and digital consumer banking platform, where we see real opportunity to expand and grow Goldman Sachs franchise, real opportunity to ultimately diversify the earnings mix and make the firm more durable, more diversified and drive higher returns. In that context, if there are opportunities to accelerate that plan and add on to those businesses or accelerate the growth of those businesses, we'll certainly consider them. But we always consider them with discipline. The lens through which we never think about doing something that was significant or transformative would be extremely high. But you saw this year, we had an opportunity in Asset Management business through NN to really strengthen our position in Europe, open up some additional distribution channels. And we think we made a very smart move in that. So, that's the lens that we're looking at. Are there ways to accelerate some of the growth and the diversification of the firm that are appropriate? When you get to some of the growthy fintech stuff, I think it gets more complicated. What was interesting about GreenSky to us was the merchant network. We were thinking about how we were going to build a merchant network, and we thought it would take a very long time, and this allowed us to build -- to acquire a merchant network at what we thought was a very attractive price, very attractive merchant network. And so, we decided that that was an appropriate way to accelerate that strategy. And so, that's the lens that we're going to look through as we continue to think about ways that we can execute on the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. Operator : Your next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just one question, David, around the consumer strategy. So, you mentioned about being opportunistic, I guess, as things come up. But, when we talk to investors, it doesn't feel like the stock is getting the credit or the relating as you diversify those earnings. One, like do you think the consumer business and the strategy needs to rethink, or are you happy with the progress that you've made, I guess, would be the first part of the question. David Solomon : So, on the first part of the question, we're very happy with the progress we're making. But again, and I've said this repeatedly, this is something we're building for the long term that we think could be a very, very big business for the firm. We're building it with a lens that we set out return targets for the business, and we're making these investments knowing that we're hugely committed to meet our return targets and move our return targets forward. And this is going to take some time, but we feel like the progress is good. As we said on the call already today, we've grown to 10 million customers. We're expanding the product offering. We have plans to continue to broaden what we're doing, and we feel very, very good about it. I don't think the strategy -- we're very, very clear on what we're doing and how we're doing it. In the short term, I don't expect to get a lot of -- for us to get a lot of credit for it, but we're doing the right thing for the long term for Goldman Sachs and our broad franchise, and we feel very good about the progress that we're making. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. And I guess just one follow-up, Denis, and apologize if this is making you repeated. But just on credit, like do you worry about taking on a lot more credit risk given the loan growth outlook that you talked about as we are probably close to the peak of the cycle in terms of the health of the consumer? Just talk about in terms of credit quality two, three years out, how do you think about it? Denis Coleman : So, thank you for the question. We're very focused on credit risk. We're very focused on risk management across all the risk stripes. And while David has highlighted our strategic objectives to grow the firm, drive more recurring durable revenues, more financing and lending activities, there is an attractiveness to the stability and predictability of that but all provided that you remain disciplined on credit. And so, that is something that we take into account as we think about the growth of our various businesses within the consumer business, within the wholesale business. And as we think about extension of credit across other segments of the firm, I would point out, for example, that where we grow in the area of FICC financing, we're doing so with secured structures at reasonable LTVs. As we deploy into the wealth segment, these are high-quality wealth management loans. And so -- and as David just referenced in the consumer sector, one of the things beyond the value of the 10,000 merchants for GreenSky is the high FICO characteristics of the customer base. And so, segment by segment, we're making an effort to grow these types of revenues, grow our balances, but to do so in a credit-sensitive fashion. Operator : Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : I wanted to follow up on the Global Markets business and how you're thinking about market share gains from here given the levels are bit more -- a little more uncertain at this point. And then also, if you could clarify the fourth quarter sequential decline in the equities trading part given the market backdrop seems to be more constructive than kind of your results. David Solomon : So, I'll start broadly and Denis will make comment on fourth quarter equities. But again, I'll take you back. We've built our Global Markets business as a client franchise. And that's been something we've been very, very focused on over the last couple of years. As you appropriately point out, Dan, we've materially moved our position with many clients, in a very, very meaningful way. I think there's still upside for us from a wallet and share perspective, looking at the broad client base. But as we look at it going forward, we'll take more sustainable share from what opportunity the market presents. And that's the nature of that business. I think we've shown over a long period of time that we're very, very good at adapting and capturing the upside that exists in that business, but we do it now from a stronger position of strength, both in terms of the nature of our client franchise, the relationships we have with our clients and also the efficiencies we have in that business. And so, we're going to continue to focus on that, and we'll see what environment is put forward as we move forward. But my guess is that this business will continue to be a very large business and probably a more consistent business than the general narrative around the business when you go back and look at it over the course of the last 10 years. Denis Coleman : Sure. And maybe just to add some context on the fourth quarter. So looking at the fourth quarter versus third quarter of '21 and also frankly versus fourth quarter of '20, the comparison is such that the performance in the prior periods was really stronger. And when we looked at the fourth quarter of 2021, we didn't have the exact same opportunities to deploy capital as we saw in the third quarter, and some of the market making for us was less attractive on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both versus the third quarter and fourth quarter in '20. But again, stepping back, equities still did deliver its second best performance ever. So from the state of the franchise, the quality of the client dialogue, the investments we've been making and the efficiencies of that business and our focus on growing the financing component of that, that all feels very good to us. David Solomon : Yes. And also just the only other thing I'd highlight, Dan, on that, just to put it in perspective, our -- and I know everybody wants to focus on the quarter, and that's obviously appropriate, but the markets business was up 4% year-over-year. And when we started the year, nobody believed that the market's business could be up from last year, given the activity level last year and last year's set. So, I think there's some structural things that have gone on that have improved the opportunity for all the participants in that business. I'm not saying it's going to level out at the level it's been in the last two years. But I do think we've sometimes got to step out of the quarter and think about what's going on in bigger bites of time, especially in that business. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: There's obviously been a lot of focus on cost this quarter, this year. But is some of it just catch-up from last year? There's been a number of media reports that Goldman Sachs and other firms showed a lot of restraint last year and were looking to catch up a bit. And I was just double-checking my model. I think your revenues were up over 20% last year, and comp was up only 8%. So, is that part of the equation here that we should just better appreciate? David Solomon : I think there's a component of that. I mean, I wouldn't -- I'd say there's a component -- where the component of that is most evident is that there is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy, everywhere. And if you talk to any CEO -- and most CEOs obviously run different employee bases than we do, but still at Goldman Sachs, when you look at our 45,000 people around the world, the vast majority of those 45,000 people fall into what you call a more traditional corporate compensation model. And I think there definitely was -- coming out of last year after we went through the compensation process, there were definitely places where I think with hindsight and with the constantly evolving environment of COVID and supply changes, the monetary and fiscal policy environment, what they did to savings rates, et cetera, where there was a real base pressure on what I'd call base kind of compensation and wage levels. And so, that's a component of it, for sure. There's also -- and I think it's got to be put -- when people are looking at it, especially in the fourth quarter, when they're looking at the comp numbers in the fourth quarter and people are doing their modeling, we told everyone that we were going to try to do better at really estimating on a quarter-to-quarter basis where the compensation levels needed to be. And last year, for example, through three quarters, our comp ratio was 36% through three quarters, and then we wound up going to 32% for the year, which made us, I think, don't hold me to this exactly, approximately 24% in the fourth quarter last year. If we had been this year, we obviously moved more aggressively through the year, we were at 31% through three quarters. If we were at 36% like we were last year, the comp ratio in the fourth quarter would have been 7%, and then people would have seen that differently. So, again, we're thinking about the year. We're trying to do what's right for the year all through the lens of our strategy to deliver the appropriate sort of returns in any environment over time. But I think I think the question is right, Matt, that there was a component of a reset given the macro environment that I think is affecting business everywhere. And I think we've done a good job kind of addressing that and taking care of that this year. And so, that's part of our base going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. David, you pointed out in your opening remarks about moving up to the top 3 position with 72 of your top 100 clients. Two-part question, one, can you share with us or elaborate on what was the driver? I mean, where is the success? Is it coming from better execution? Is it coming from using your balance sheet, better relationships? And second, will these reasons that drove you up to 72 from 51 be a real strength in a disruptive market where maybe we have markets down this year and not being up, as you pointed out earlier? David Solomon : Yes. So, thanks for the question, Gerard. And again, this goes back to the One Goldman Sachs strategy and some things we laid out in a very clear fashion a couple of years ago about the way we wanted to evolve the firm. And while there have been parts of our organization, particularly the Investment Banking franchise that have always been extremely client-centric, we didn't feel like in our markets business, we were focused enough on the quality of those relationships. We weren't metricing. And I know a lot of this is going to sound like very basic stuff. We weren't metricing and targeting it appropriately. And there's a lot that we have learned as an organization over time that we thought could apply to the Global Markets business and really improve our position. The move from 51 to I think it's 71 or 72, 72 right now, comes from the execution over the last two years of that strategy. We are actively taking feedback and looking at metrics on our performance against this client base. The feedback is very, very strong from our clients that they see a change in the way we're interacting with them, and that's benefiting our wallet share. I think there's still some upside in that. Moving -- if you're not top 3 from -- with more than 51 of them and now you go to 71, your top 3, well, for some of them, you're number 3, you can still be number2 or number1. And we think the base number of 72 can be higher. You're not going to get to be top 3 with all 100, but we think it can be higher than 72. So, we do think there's still some more upside in that if we continue to execute on a very client-centric strategy. If clients have a good experience with us, if they feel like we're taking their long-term interest at heart in every interaction and everything we do, it improves our activity with them. To the latter part of your question, I do think in any environment, we have a more sustainable franchise, and we will benefit from that. And so, I think we'll continue to benefit from that investment, but more work to do for sure. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Maybe a question on the acquisitions as we get closer to the closing of NNIP and GreenSky, are you feeling better, worse about the strategic synergies? And do you see these deals having any noticeable impact on earnings and returns in the intermediate term, or these are longer-term projects? Thanks. David Solomon : I appreciate the question, Jim. I mean, we absolutely feel we feel just as good about them today as when we decided to do them. I think what I can report is whenever you do something like this, you start planning integration. And we have integration teams on both deals, and the work that we're doing to prepare for integration as these deals come to close is going very well and in sync with what we expected in some places, some upside to what we expected. That said, these are medium to longer term acquisitions. In the short term, there's expense pressure and things that come through the P&L, which obviously we're accounting for as we talk about our return targets. But we feel very good about the medium and longer term contribution that these will make, just as I said earlier, to strengthen and bolster and accelerate these franchises. Operator : Your next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas Exane. Jeremy Sigee : You talked about headwinds to the capital ratio. I just wondered if you could scope for us what -- how big the main ones are, what are the major items and how big they are? And sort of linked to that, how soon would you expect to move back up to a higher pace of share buybacks? Is that a 2Q reality, or is that too soon? Will it take longer? Denis Coleman : So, a couple of things I would mention to you as we think about capital ratio. So obviously, ending at -- ending the year at 14.2%, what I was focused on in particular in terms of a discernible headwind is actually the announced but not yet closed acquisition of NNIP. We expect that to close in the beginning part of the second quarter, and that would take sort of 20 basis points of the ratio to address that. And as it relates to sizing up our share buybacks, I mentioned the expectation that for the first quarter, we'd be at or around the level of the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is to ensure that we do have the capacity to support client activity. And having referenced that, our Investment Banking backlog is up significantly year-over-year. And given the outlook for markets where we have a path towards rate normalization, ongoing energy transition, single stock volatility, we see lots of opportunities. We want to make sure we're available to support our clients' strategic objectives. So hopefully, that's helpful context for you. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Thanks for accommodating the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on the transaction banking business. It's not one that got much airplay on this call, but it's admittedly tough to ignore the firm-wide deposit growth of 40% year-on-year. And certainly, this business is contributing to that momentum. I was hoping you could speak to the revenue contribution from the business today or in the most recent quarter and the success you're having, specifically in attracting operational deposits from these clients. Denis Coleman : Okay. Steve, it's Denis. I'll take that. Thank you for that question. I mean, obviously, transaction banking, 1 of the 4 initiatives that David highlighted and an opportunity from an addressable market perspective that is very, very large and one where we're seeing very good momentum. So, we focused obviously on our tech, on the platform, on the user interface. That's now been well validated by clients coming on board the platform. We have active clients in excess of 350 at this point in time. The deposit growth, as you noted, over $50 billion and ahead of target, feeling very, very good about that. On the last quarter's call, we mentioned that operational and insured deposits as a percentage of core deposits had ticked up over 25%. That's now ticked up over 30%. So again, as David indicated, in terms of metrics and management and targets and the way in which we look to grow and build these strategic businesses, we're trying to provide these benchmarks, which we hold ourselves accountable to make progress time over time. I guess, on the revenue front, we've also made very good progress. So revenues for 2021 are up more than 50% and now north of approximately $225 million for the year. So, across each of the aspects of that build and that business and in light of what we see is a very, very attractive addressable market that leverages our core competency with the corporates, we feel good about the progress to date and on the forward. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : Great. So, since there are no more questions, we'd just like to thank everyone for joining the call. And if additional questions do arise, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. And otherwise, please stay healthy, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 14, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me now pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. There's no question the first quarter was extremely volatile. Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation rose across the globe, and we saw an accelerating trend towards de-globalization. In recent decades, we've grown used to low inflation, low interest rates and the free flow of people and goods across national borders. I believe we're entering a period that won't be -- that won't be the case and the consequences for financial markets will be meaningful. Although, much remains uncertain, I'm proud that Goldman Sachs effectively supported its clients in this type of environment. This is a testament to the progress we've made to center our strategy around clients. At a time of great volatility it was clear, our clients needed help managing their risk, and they turn to us for our expertise in navigating this changing landscape. The recent turbulence is nothing to change our firm's client-oriented strategy. In fact, it makes it all the more imperative. We are building a more resilient, diversified franchise that can generate solid returns even in more uncertain markets. In February, I laid out our revised medium-term return targets. I'm very proud that even with the headwinds we faced; our results this quarter meet those objectives. We are also well positioned to achieve the targets we laid out for our growth initiatives across asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer. In some areas, we have accelerated our progress with the acquisitions, including GreenSky, which closed in late March; and NNIP, which closed earlier this week. I'm thrilled to be welcoming these great businesses to Goldman Sachs. For the quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.9 billion, generated earnings per share of $10.76, an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%. As I noted, the evolving market backdrop had a significant effect on client activity. This meant that some parts of our firm faced significant headwinds, like equity capital markets, where issuance volumes were lackluster for the quarter. On the other hand, Global Markets had a strong quarter, as this environment allowed us to support clients in the risk intermediation and financing needs. And in line with our strategy, several of our growth areas continue to reflect durability despite the difficult environment. For example, we saw solid management and other fees across asset management, wealth management, as well as revenue growth in our consumer business. But there's no question that the most significant event of the first quarter was the invasion of Ukraine. As I've said before, we condemn the invasion in the strongest possible terms, and our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. This act of aggression demands a response that Goldman Sachs is committed to doing its part. Early on, we took action to ensure the well-being of our people and to begin winding down our firm's operations in Russia. That process is ongoing. Let me also say a few words on our direct financial exposure to Russia. Our positions were relatively limited, but we've been focused on closing them out and reducing our exposure. The overall direct financial impact from Russia and Ukraine related instruments on our first quarter revenues was a net loss of approximately $300 million. Our risk mitigation efforts would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our people around the globe on both the business and the control side of our firm. Our risk management culture is a true differentiator for us, and we continue to navigate - as we continue to navigate this volatile environment. More broadly, the Russian invasion has further complicated the geopolitical landscape and created an additional level of uncertainty that I expect will outlast the war itself. While it is encouraging to see a newfound unity among the Western democracies, the trend towards deglobalization is clearly gaining momentum. The consequences of that shift are likely to be significant and long lasting, and I believe it will take some time to fully appreciate all the second and third [order] (ph) ramifications. Beyond geopolitics, I'm keeping a close eye on several other trends. While US unemployment levels are low and wages are increasing, inflation is the highest it's been in decades. We're seeing new stress on supply chain and commodity prices and US households are facing rising gas prices as well as higher prices for food and housing. We've also seen an increased risk of stagflation and mixed signals on consumer confidence. These cross currents will certainly create ongoing complexity in the economic outlook, but whatever the future holds, I believe Goldman Sachs is well positioned. We continue to make progress on our growth strategy and our commitments to clients a strong -- our commitment to clients is stronger than ever. I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.9 billion and net earnings of $3.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $10.76. As David noted, firm-wide performance was strong with an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%, notwithstanding an operating environment that was significantly less favorable than the prior year. Turning to performance by segment starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.4 billion. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, as our M&A franchise continued its outstanding performance and client dialogue remain significantly elevated. In the quarter, we closed over 115 deals for approximately $385 billion of deal volume and maintained our number one league table position with nearly $360 billion in announced transactions. This was roughly $155 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, the largest quarterly lead in our history as a public firm. In equity underwriting, net revenues were $261 million, down significantly versus a record performance in the first quarter of 2021 on the lower industry issuance volumes that David mentioned. Despite this, we continue to rank number one year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings with volume market share of 8%. Debt underwriting net revenues were $743 million, 16% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower results in leveraged finance and asset-backed activity. While transactions have slowed from the elevated pace of last year and deals have been pushed out, given the uncertain backdrop, our investment banking backlog remains robust. Client engagement is strong, catalyzed by secular trends like digital disruption and transformation across industries and future activity will likely be bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. Moving to Global Markets on page four. Segment net revenues were $7.9 billion in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. We saw exceptional strength in both our FICC and Equities businesses. On page five, you can see revenues across FICC were $4.7 billion in the first quarter, 21% higher than the strong results in the first quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $4 billion. This was driven by particular strength in our macro products with elevated activity across rates, currencies, and commodities. These macro businesses within FICC, which generally represent the preponderance of FICC intermediation revenues, benefit from a portfolio effect. Our diversified and global footprint, combined with our risk intermediation and execution capabilities is a key differentiator. FICC financing generated record revenues of $685 million, which were up 23% sequentially and 55% year-on-year with particular strength in mortgages. Total equities revenues were $3.1 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 16% year-over-year, driven by lower activity in both cash and derivatives due to fewer market-making opportunities compared to a very strong backdrop at the start of 2021. Equity financing produced net revenues of $988 million. Though lower on a year-on-year basis, these results were 21% higher sequentially. While average prime balances declined slightly from record levels at year-end, opportunities to provide client liquidity increased, which drove stronger quarterly performance. Moving to Asset Management on page six, first quarter revenues were $546 million, materially lower than the first quarter of last year due to market headwinds in equity investments and lending and debt investments. Management and other fees totaled $772 million, up 4% sequentially. Net revenues for equity investments were negative $360 our public and private portfolios, we experienced substantial losses tied to Russia-related positions, all of which have been written down to 0. More broadly, we experienced additional headwinds due to the overall market environment. All in, we experienced roughly $620 million of net losses in our public portfolio, offset by approximately $255 million in net gains across our private portfolio, largely due to event-driven items, including asset sales and financing rounds. We harvested $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments in the first quarter. We remain fully committed to reducing this portfolio over time and have line of sight on another $1 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to approximately $750 million of capital reduction. Turning to page nine, Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees were $1.3 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 on seasonality and counseling fees, but up 17% year-over-year. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $339 million were up 28% year-on-year, driven by higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $483 million in the first quarter, up 28% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. We continue to grow credit card loans and deposit balances. Next, on page 10. Across these two segments, total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion, with a quarterly decline, primarily driven by net market depreciation of $94 billion, partially offset by $24 billion of long-term net inflows. Combined firm-wide management and other fees for the first quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2 billion, driven by higher average AUS versus last year. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the first quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting higher loan balances and lower funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $166 billion, up $8 billion versus year-end 2021, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and credit cards. For the first quarter, our provision for credit losses was $561 million, up from $344 million in the fourth quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to the growth in our lending portfolio as well as broader macroeconomic factors, including a slowing growth outlook. As we continue to expand our consumer business and grow our lending activities, we are cognizant that macro headwinds and inflationary pressures could potentially weigh on payment rates and thus portfolio performance. While we have not seen any meaningful signs of deterioration in credit metrics, we are being vigilant and will continue to monitor performance and macro conditions to assess risk mitigation measures and calibrate our underwriting where needed. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year. This drove an efficiency ratio for the quarter of 59.7%. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $3.6 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, driven by our continued investments, particularly in technology, that will further enhance our infrastructure and support our strategic growth initiatives. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.4% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of roughly $700 million. As it relates to the second quarter, we deployed capital to support the closing of the NNIP transaction, and we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the durability and resilience of our client franchise across almost any environment. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical complexity, we remain focused on executing on our strategic plan to diversify our business mix and drive competitive returns for shareholders, and we have significant confidence in our forward momentum as an organization. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So, I appreciate the $1 billion harvesting out of the balance sheet PE and the other $1 billion coming up. So, it's a partial answer to the question. But in the backdrop that we've seen with slowing M&A in almost no IPOs. My original question was going to be, can you still get to that SCB of 5% that's so important to give us all confidence about putting up that 15% to 17% return over time? How do you view that forward look of the march towards 5%? Denis Coleman : So Glenn, it's Denis. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Obviously, our results in the quarter in terms of RoTE of 15.8% and ROE was 15%. Our medium-term targets that you referenced were to be achieved by 2024. So we're really pleased with the performance in this quarter. As it relates to SCB, for us, it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix, creating more durable and predictable revenue streams, and then also continuing to migrate down our on-balance sheet equity position. So I think our commitment to the strategy remains intact. We have, obviously, submitted our CCAR submission, and we await response from the Federal Reserve. And we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can, all of which we hope will contribute to an SCB that is lower and reflects our business mix. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that it's working so far good first quarter. Maybe a little follow-up on the sponsor side. And it's both as you as someone that's planning to raise a lot of third-party money as an alternative manager and also you as the largest servicer of that sponsor community, can you give a little insight towards just what's going on? Do you expect -- is the capital raising environment disrupted. You harvested $1 billion, but can you still have a decent harvesting backdrop amidst the disruptive banking backdrop? Thanks so much. David Solomon : Sure, Glenn, it's David. And I'll jump in here. I would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms. I think despite the volatility that exists in markets, those trends continue to be in place. And I think you'll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital, institutional capital that's allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time. In the context of that, I think we and others do have big broad multi-product, global platforms that are well-positioned. And so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and flow a little bit from peaks, I think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility. I don't think in the short run will affect that. With respect to monetizations and values, there is no question that we've gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that. There were a variety of factors that I think were more short-term than amplified that. And I think we've commented in the past about the fact that we did not think that was levels of activity were sustainable. However, even in an environment like this, when you have a broad diversified portfolio of assets, and there are certainly lots of areas where there's real growth in the economy, and the economy is still growing very well, the opportunity to see monetizations, to see transactions, I think, continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in 2020 and 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning. So overall RoTE of 16% was pretty impressive in the quarter, given it was a pretty challenging backdrop. Are you now in a place where you think, given the diversity of the business model that Goldman should pretty much always earn cost of capital on a quarterly basis? David Solomon : Well, I mean, I -- always is a definitive word. We never say always to anything because there certainly could be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes, a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other. I do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made significant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business, and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully, over time, will give the market more confidence in the durability of these returns. I think we're well-positioned. In February, we laid out these medium-term targets. We do not lay out targets lightly. So I would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter, Christian, but I think we have a larger more durable business, and I think we're going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward, and we're very committed to executing on that strategy. Christian Bolu : Okay. Thanks. On FICC, just maybe more broadly, intermediation businesses. How do you think about the potential going forward as the Fed sort of shrink its balance sheet and raises rates, trying to figure out the potential for meaningfully good volatility and greater demand for risk intermediation services versus any sort of funding cost headwinds that may occur? David Solomon : So I mean, I comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that. And I'm not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is. We're more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact. Intermediation is a big business. I think it's always going to be a big business. That doesn't mean that it can't ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. But I think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity that's out there for firms like ourselves that play a big role in this is bigger today than it was five years ago, going back pre-pandemic. And in addition, based on investments we've made both in the client centricity and the approach we're taking and in technology, our market shares are larger, and we think those market share gains are durable. I'd also highlight that we've been -- and we've been very clear with you on this, building our financing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is financing revenue and that financing revenue is more durable. So I feel good about the way the business is positioned. I won't speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward. But certainly, I think, we're better positioned in this business today than we were five years ago. And I think that's reflected, for example, in a quarter like this and the results of the client activity we're able to accomplish. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So wanted to start off with a question on capital management. You guys were clear positive outliers in the quarter. Many of your peers reported pretty significant drawdowns in CET1. Admittedly, I was a bit surprised to see the improvement in your ratios, just given a lot of the sources of RWA inflation that have been cited on some of the other calls have really highlighted market risk RWA inflation. I was hoping you can just give some perspective on how much of an impact did you see from higher market risk RWAs in the quarter, where you could see some relief down the road? And just given the accretion in capital you saw in the quarter, whether there's any appetite to accelerate buybacks, especially into a declining share price? Denis Coleman : Sure, Steven. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter, that was deliberate. We knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the NNIP acquisition. And so we had -- we've grown our capital over the course of the first quarter. We also were very disciplined on RWA growth. Our growth was $5 billion on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we were able to deliver types of results that David just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to RWA growth so that also contributed to the improvement. Now as it relates to our outlook, we've been reasonably clear that our first priority in terms of driving long-term results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities. And once again, you would see in the first quarter with the Global Markets segment ROE north of 25% and firm line ROE at 15%, there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities, and we prioritized that. We remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend. And then obviously, to the extent the opportunities to support clients or the market environment shifts, obviously, we'd look to return that capital back to shareholders. I would say from where I sit right now, looking at the second quarter, my expectation on buybacks is to be reasonably consistent with the first quarter, but we do expect to remain nimble. And to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price, that's obviously something that we'll consider. Steven Chubak : That's great color, Denis. And just for my follow-up on the investment banking businesses. You noted the backlogs are stable year-on-year, certainly a good outcome given the macro uncertainty. But I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity on the individual investment banking businesses and more specifically, how you expect them to perform over the next, call it, six to 12 months? And how much of the slowdown that we've first quarter would you attribute to growing macro risks and waning CEO confidence that could drive a more prolonged slowdown versus maybe something that's more temporary due to the elevated market volatility? David Solomon : So I'll start, Steve, and just say that, that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high. There's no question that equity beta kind of turned off for the quarter. And so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out. That definitely is a market volatility effect. And my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does, that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace. We've seen when you look over the course of the last 20 years, plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very, very low equity issuance, it's been very rare that, that continues for a year or a longer period and that doesn't mean that, that couldn't happen, but certainly that would be expected given the history. As businesses need capital, they need to make investments at a time as prices reset or values reset, people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations. But ultimately, at the end of the day, they understand the reality and they move forward. I don't see a significant change in kind of strategic dialogue. I would say if the world got materially worse and materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuff that was going on, that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue, but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good, quite robust. But we watch it very, very closely. I would note that I think it's important to just recognize and we said this at the year-end, at year-end on the year-end call that the activity levels that we saw in 2021 in the banking business, nobody expected those to be normalized levels. So I'd certainly describe a little bit of what we're seeing as a normalization. And I think first quarter overall activity, there's some normalization of that, although, I think equity is well below what I would call a normalized trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I know we've talked a lot about the investment banking side of the business. Maybe we could turn to the loan growth areas that you're focused on. And just want to understand what you're expecting there from some of the recent acquisitions like GreenSky, some of the new relationships that you've got, I know it's been a couple of years already, but Apple Card is growing nicely from the GM relationship. How should we think about the capital call that that piece of the business will have? And what kind of growth rate you expect to get this year? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Hi, Betsy. Thank you very much for the question. Look, we've been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of GreenSky, or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our FICC financing businesses, we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a credit sensitive fashion. And in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that through the P&L, you'll see that in the first quarter, we did raise our provisions for credit losses. They were at 561 versus 344 and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity. So that's something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them. We expect as we grow the portfolio of GreenSky that will also continue to provision. So it remains focused for the firm. We're looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so. Betsy Graseck : Yes. And that's kind of the follow-up I had, because we've got the forward curve looking for something like nine rate hikes this year, a few more next year. And so there's a triangulation between rate hikes and credit quality. And how are you thinking about that? When you talk about the provision increase you've done, maybe you could unpack that a little bit as to how much of that was coming from loan volume increase expected versus what you're anticipating for credit quality changes, given that backdrop I just mentioned? Denis Coleman : Sure. Fair enough. And that's a question we're very, very focused on. I mean, in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance, we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios. We remain very mindful of that, given some of the headwinds that are on the forward, but if you look at metrics like our charge-offs in the first quarter, they were $154 million, net charge-off rate of 0.4% unchanged quarter-over-quarter. And as we think about growing these particular businesses, underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow. And to the extent we see indications significantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration, that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take risk mitigating actions in the forward as a result. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, if you could just, David and team, maybe just summarize where you think we are in terms of normalizing? You said equity underwriting would be below normal and maybe trading is way above. And I know nobody has a crystal ball and it's tough. But one of your competitor banks talked about volatility remaining elevated. And I don't know, just how should we think about the normalization of the legacy capital market businesses here? And also, how much did commodities contribute to this quarter? Was it a record or close to a record? David Solomon : So, Mike, I don't -- it's \u2013 and I know I just used it myself, I use the term normalization. We're talking about the equity capital markets business. It's very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say, that's not a normalized run rate level for that business. I would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the first quarter of 2021 was not a normal level for the business. When you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets, again, I would amplify I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you exactly where it's going to settle out, but I think these are good businesses, where we have a high degree of confidence that through market cycles, we can produce very nice returns in these businesses.  We think it's a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have. And we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly. Commodities was not a record. There's no question that when you look at the FICC macro business where there was really great performance, it was well diversified across rates, commodities and currencies. I mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed. But that's what I'd say to that point.  So again, I'd go back, I think these businesses are in terms of available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were five years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition we continue to invest in things in those businesses, which we think strengthen our competitive position. but it's hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number, it's just not that kind of business. Mike Mayo : All right. Let me follow up a different way then. In terms of your market share improvement with your capital markets businesses with corporates, I know that's part of the, kind of, the one firm directive, can you -- do you have any metrics around that progress and how you're doing with corporates? David Solomon : Sure. I mean we -- I'll point out something that I think is an anecdotal metric, but I think it's interesting. We have 100 -- when you open the M&A lead table, which is something obviously we dominate, we have $155 billion lead for the quarter. That's the largest one quarter lead we've ever had in our history in the M&A lead table. So that's a metric that's reflective of clients coming to us. We're tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets. And we've seen market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years, and we'll continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure they're very durable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Betsy asked about this broadly, but maybe more narrowly with GreenSky now closed. How should we think about loans? From my understanding, their loans were securitized, right? So, basically, is the idea that they will mature off and as GreenSky underwrites new loans, then those loans would be on Goldman's balance sheet, and so it would just sort of naturally migrate as the portfolio matures and is reissued? And should we think about it just getting to that roughly $10 billion level where GreenSky had been running? How should we think about that? David Solomon : So in terms of our strategy, we would expect over time that as GreenSky continues to originate, we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. We certainly would retain the flexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously. But the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. I think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter. And so, we're stepping into them based on that level of activity, and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thank you for that. And then, similarly, as far as deposits and deposit costs. What are the expectations for deposit beta in Marcus for this rate hiking cycle? Last cycle was a little unusual. It was a growing and newer platform, more established now. As a happy Marcus customer and myself, I've been watching my yield that it hasn't really moved much, which is not that surprising, because we're just getting started. But how should we be thinking about that on a go-forward? Denis Coleman : Fair enough. You're right to observe that we have not increased our market savings rate. Look, in terms of how we're thinking about the deposit betas across the channels, I mean, that really -- you really need a through-the-cycle experience. We have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle. This cycle will be different than previous cycles. Obviously, I would say at the very, very beginning part of the cycle, the experience is outperforming our expectations. But I think that's because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors. But we remain really focused on managing that, continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning, David and Denis. Maybe I'll just stick on the same theme here on consumer. I'd love to talk about just the consumer product road map and what we could expect from here, I'm sure you don't want to kind of give away your entire hand here, but just kind of what to think about as a natural extension coming next? And then obviously, with the Apple news and kind of where they're going, how that affects buy now pay later and any other kind of parts of the strategy in terms of timing? Denis Coleman : Okay. Great. Thank you for the question. So in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank, a lot of the pieces to the puzzle are in place at this point. A lot of those investments have been made, and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that we've invested in and built out. I mean to give you a sense, our active customers in the consumer space are north of $13 million now. And that number in the fourth quarter was less than $10 million. So we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition, both organically and inorganically, which is an important piece of the strategy. I think perhaps next up on the product road map will be the launch of checking. We're already piloting that internally, and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year. And that will be -- I think that will be an important piece of the product road map for us. David Solomon : The only thing I would add to that, Devin, is I just highlight back in the February update, we put out a $4 billion revenue target. And I just want to tie that target to what Denis said when he said most of the investment was made. Most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something I want to amplify. And then just finally, because you referenced it, our partnership with Apple is very, very strong. While there's been a Bloomberg article about what Apple is doing Apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time, and I would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership. Devin Ryan : Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the color. Quick follow-up just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio. I know it's very the year, so it's hard to give much of a prediction. But comp ratio net provision was 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year, even with, I would say, kind of an unfavorable mix. So is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year and just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop? David Solomon : Well, as we've said always, we're a pay-for-performance culture. This is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the first quarter. We manage this very closely. We're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively. And we will also obviously pay for performance. So I'm not going to speculate going forward, but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. And we obviously -- the one thing I'd just highlight is our focus on our efficiency ratio, and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efficiency ratio. And so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. A question just on asset management with the NN deal now closed. Do you see yourself as a scale provider with that property now? And then within that, maybe highlight or remind us what the opportunity set is with that business in terms of incremental growth now that it's closed? David Solomon : Sure and I appreciate the question, Dan. I mean I would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition, but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in Europe. It opens that some interesting distribution channel, and it accelerates some of our capabilities around ESG-oriented products. So, it was a good step forward to expand that growth. I believe -- Carey will correct me if I'm wrong, it's the fifth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. We see opportunity based on our footprint, our global position, our client mix, our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business, both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with NN, and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there, but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the firm. Dan Fannon : That's helpful. I guess just in similar context with wealth in terms of the outlook for growth, that's also an area where there has been a fair amount of consolidation within the industry. Do you see yourself as a potential participant in that? And maybe kind of the acceleration of hiring and/or some of the initiatives you put in place, how are you thinking about kind of the growth of the wealth business at this point? David Solomon : Well, you can see from our earnings, the growth of the wealth business year-over-year. We continue to be focused on that opportunity. And I'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. You add wealth advisers, you add footprint. It's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically. But we see it as a very big opportunity. I think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. It's only been the last couple of years first with the United Capital acquisition and also to our AECO channel, we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. I think we're off to a good start there, but I think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist I think our Ayco channel, Goldman Sachs Ayco is a very, very unique platform to work through corporations. And I do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with Wealth Management services. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. David, you made an interesting comment about when you were asked about the pipelines that it takes a little while for the potential issue is to realize that they need to reset maybe their expectations. In your experience, how long does it take -- assuming markets don't come roaring back, and I'd say they stay below they were maybe 6 months or 12 months ago, how long does it take for that reset to finally say, okay, yes, we still need to raise the capital, even though it's at lower levels than we originally would have liked? David Solomon : Yes, I think, Gerard, it's a hard question to answer very specifically and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under. But I think if you want me to make a very generic generalization, these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. It's more something that happens real time over months or quarters. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up to another comment you made, you talked about how the global capital markets today versus five years ago are much larger, which obviously we have seen. How much of an impact do you think the quantitative easing by the global central banks? Because I think now it's over $30 trillion of those balance sheets that are outstanding. We all know the US Fed is that $9 trillion, up from $4 trillion at the start of the pandemic. When we go into QT in the US at least, they're going to bring those balances down. What kind of effect -- any color on what you think may happen versus what happened over the past five years when those balances blew out? David Solomon : Well, there's no question that -- and I've tried to say it in different ways, and there's no science to this. And no one knows obviously, where the macro environment goes as we go forward. But when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021, we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reflection of some of that monetary fiscal policy. That doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and fiscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately. I think these are big businesses. There\u2019s a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and financing that will continue to go on. But there's no question, it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just talk about the bank a little bit. You've kind of stealthily grown the US bank to be sort of almost a top 10 player. I appreciate some of the color around the loan book and its rate sensitivity, but the bank balance sheet is almost three to four times the size of the loan book. So can we -- can you give us some sense of how we should think about asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment in the bank? And if there's -- we'd like to think that there's some material upside there given the size of the bank? David Solomon : Sure. Thank you for the question and to help through that. I think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. On the one hand, we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity, that is modestly asset sensitive. So when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve, we think that will be a benefit to the firm. The other thing that I should mention, which is separate, but probably also important just to be clear on and that is, in the past, we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-off of fee waivers may have on the forward. I would just point out that in the first quarter, we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. And on the forward, we expect those to be negligible. So, that too, obviously only a one-time benefit with the first hike, but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well. Denis Coleman : I'd also to highlight -- I'm sorry, Jim. I'd also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits, and deposits are important for funding. So, our bank has many activities across the firm. And obviously, we're growing our lending businesses. But this strategy also affects our market businesses positively too. Jim Mitchell : No, absolutely. I just -- I'm trying to think through ex the market's NII, which obviously tends to be liability sensitive. But if we just think about the bank, the loan book you've disclosed, I think, within the bank, something like $800 million to $900 million from a 100 basis point move, is it at least fair to say that the bank in total would NII benefit from a 100 basis point move would be better or worse. Just trying to get -- think through the other parts of the balance sheet and how that NII can react and what that growth could look like if there's a way to frame that? David Solomon : Yeah. Look, I think I would just refocus you on my comments previously. Overall, NII sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive, I think, just given the relative size, even though we've grown it substantially, given our relative size, relative to some of our larger competitors. And I think that proxy that I offer you on behalf of the firm is a good way of thinking about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first of all, can we talk about your management of the efficiency ratio? Last year, it seems to be more volatile than usual. I guess, in the first three quarters, it ran at quite a low level. And then in the fourth quarter, it seems like you had some, kind of, like cost true-up both for compensation, but also for non-comp. I was wondering if we should expect the same thing again for this year, the first three quarters running at a lower level and then the fourth quarter being higher. And then what would you guide to really for the full year as a whole? Denis Coleman : Okay. Thanks very much for the question, Andrew. I think as David indicated, from an overall framing perspective on firm-wide operating expenses, we have put out this efficiency target of approximately 60%, and that is a target and a lens through, which we look at the combined set of expenses, compensation and non-compensation. The compensation level that we set for the first quarter, obviously, our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year, but I could not predict for you at this point, what our full year compensation ratio will be. That will be a function of our performance, the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efficiency level efficiency ratio. On the non-comp side we\u2019re making decisions and taking steps to manage non-comp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investments for the long-term strength and growth of the firm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other non-compensation expenses that are less strategic. Andrew Lim : Great. Thanks. And then just switching type as a follow-up question. You seem to be a leader in the crypto and blockchain space, it's been a few years coming now for banks to try and get some products off the ground. But maybe this year, you might see something a bit more material. So I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what we could expect maybe this year in terms of your product pipeline and what could be commercialized in the crypto and blockchain space? David Solomon : Well, at a high level, Andrew, what I'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. But in terms of our product offering and what we can do, we're really following a regulatory lead. But at the moment, the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very, very small. I don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022, but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. And certainly, when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure, payment systems and other activities in the financial markets, we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how Goldman Sachs participates in that and how that will affect different business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency -- clients' interest in cryptocurrency. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : Great. Thanks, Erica. Since there are no more questions, we'd like to thank everyone for joining the call. And if you do have other questions, they come up throughout the day, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. Thank you very much. . Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. I am pleased with our performance this quarter. There is no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset prices, market activity and confidence. We see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy. And what\u2019s unusual about this particular period is that both demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events, namely the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chains. Our economist, meanwhile, say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second half of the year. The answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely. Given all of this, we are seeing shifts in monetary policy and those shifts will continue to tighten economic conditions. I expect there is going to be more volatility and there is going to be more uncertainty. And in light of the current environment, we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically. Our risk management culture and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the firm. That said, there is nothing about this environment that changes our strategy and we are committed to our medium-term targets. We have a strong client franchise and we remain focused on providing differentiated service. We benefit from the diversity of our businesses and their global footprint. In light of the environment, we are certainly taking deliberate action on capital and expenses, but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our firm. Let me now turn to our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $11.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $7.73 and an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 11.4%. Our book value per share finished the quarter at $302, up 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. In Investment Banking, we remain the number one adviser in M&A and equity capital markets. And though capital markets activity has declined, our client dialogue and engagement continues to be strong. This quarter again reaffirmed our strategy to be global, broad and deep in our leading global markets franchise. Each week, clients turn to us for our market expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification of our businesses across this segment. I am very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help our clients manage risk and meet their financing needs. In this environment, our on-balance sheet investments faced significant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in 2021. Our management and other fees were resilient as we remain focused on growing fee-based revenue streams across our asset management and wealth management segments and further reducing our on-balance sheet investments as markets allow. And in consumer, we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both organically and through partnerships. Before turning it over to Denis, let me spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. I was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buffer, especially because the test this year was more challenging than in the past. This is a reflection of the progress we are making in our strategic evolution. That said we will advance our efforts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to reduce our capital requirements over time. Following the stress test results, our Board of Directors also declared a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share. This follows an increase of 60% in 2021 and over 50% in 2019. In addition, with regard to our GSIB buffer, while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last 3 years, it is our current plan to target a 3% GSIB surcharge. This intention is driven by the recent operating environment as well as client needs. Should these change, we will naturally reevaluate. In closing, I remain confident in our ability to navigate the market environment, serve our clients and create long-term value for shareholders. Despite the uncertainty we face, we continue to drive this organization forward by executing our client-oriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let\u2019s start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $7.73. We reposted a return on common equity of 10.6% and return on tangible equity of 11.4%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion, down 41% versus a year ago. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion. Our global M&A franchise remained strong as we closed over 115 deals for approximately $380 billion of deal volume in the quarter, further strengthening our number one league table position. Equity underwriting net revenues were $131 million. Industry volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility. Despite this, we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves. Debt underwriting net revenues were $457 million, where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate increases in the quarter. While our Investment Banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year, it is still higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to 2021. We feel good about the quality of our backlog based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive repositioning of client portfolios, but we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists. Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition financing activities. We saw continued growth in our Transaction Banking business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter, generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date. Moving to Global Markets on Page 4, segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market. Looking at FICC on Page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter. In FICC intermediation, we saw a 50% increase in revenues with 3 of our 5 FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the strength and breadth of our diversified franchise. Our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we help clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues in rates, commodities and currencies. And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity, which helped delivered record results. Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 2% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment. Activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago and 14% versus the first quarter. Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of financing from our clients. Growth in equities financing, coupled with record performance in FICC financing, is a reflection of our strategy to grow client financing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our overall Global Markets revenues this quarter. Moving to Asset Management on Page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by net losses from our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of $305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP, which contributed roughly $170 million of management and other fees this quarter. Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter. More specifically, on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440 million of net revenues. We generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the portfolio. Additionally, we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $100 million of marks, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party funds. And in the second quarter, we raised over $20 billion of commitments. We also harvested over $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments. The pace of our realizations this quarter was influenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets, making it more difficult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago as net interest income of $275 million was partly offset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening. I will turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 9. We produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both Wealth Management and Consumer Banking. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year, driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While private banking and lending net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record results last quarter, revenues were up 23% year-on-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer banking revenues were $608 million in the second quarter, rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the first quarter. Now moving to Page 10. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. We expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year. On Page 11, total firm-wide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the first quarter due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $176 billion, up $10 billion versus the first quarter primarily due to growth in corporate, wealth management and residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561 million in the first quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter. Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remain strong as reflected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate. Now, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by integration and run-rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology, and higher levels of business activity. Together, NNIP and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-compensation expenses this quarter. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we are taking a number of actions to improve our operating efficiency. Specifically, we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward, though these actions will take some time to be reflected in our results. We are keeping in mind, however, that while we are being disciplined about our expenses, we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy. Turning to capital on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year. This past quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700 million. As David noted earlier, in the third quarter, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share. Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price. In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reflect our ability to navigate volatile markets, while actively supporting our clients. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I apologize if I missed it within your remarks, but can you tell us what the P&L contribution from the $1 billion or so in dispositions out of the private equity book was? And I want to ask that in the context of when people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets that they want to see why you have confidence, what about the portfolio gives you such confidence that it wasn\u2019t as affected by what\u2019s going on in the public markets? Thanks so much. Denis Coleman : Thanks, Glenn. It\u2019s Denis. Let me take that for you. So, we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. And specifically, we made note of event-driven gains of approximately $380 million during the quarter. We noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across consumer and technology sectors. And what I would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very, very granular basis. It\u2019s comprised of both corporate and real estate assets. And we look at the performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance. On average, they are growing north of 20%. And if we were to take a look at some public comparable, albeit an imperfect one, those are growing in a negative fashion. And so it reflects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Very much appreciated. And then one quick follow-up, obviously, ECM and DCM pipelines are down a lot given what we have seen. But you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. I wonder if you could expand on that a little bit, because we haven\u2019t seen a lot of activity these days in M&A? Thanks. Denis Coleman : What I would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number, which is quite significant at $1.2 billion. And we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. I think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what\u2019s particularly strategic for them. The nature of the transactions that they maybe considering could very well be different in their complexion than a year ago, but nevertheless, our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market. So, we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. There is no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if confidence were impaired, we could see some softening even in our advisory activities. But to-date, they have been strong. On the underwriting side, that\u2019s much more a reflection of the current capital markets\u2019 receptivity, and again, strong levels of client engagement. We like our backlog, but it is \u2013 there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Denis. Denis Coleman : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Denis. So, you posted pretty strong results this morning. You are continuing to take market share in trading. ROE year-to-date is 13%, just pretty good given the backdrop for me and you guys\u2019 tone sounds very, very cautious. So what exactly are you worried about in the macro backdrop, maybe just more specifically? And how does that impact your thinking on timeline to achieve medium-term ROE targets? David Solomon : I will start, Christian. I don\u2019t know if Denis will add anything to it. I think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. The environment is very uncertain. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inflationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation. And as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy. I think it\u2019s hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. And so I think it\u2019s prudent for us to be cautious. Now that said, I think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader, much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we benefited from that in the context of the quarter. So we feel good about our ability to operate. I would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty, clients are still relatively active. Denis was just talking about M&A activity, and our clients are active. Capital markets activity is obviously down. This is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it\u2019s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. So we continue to monitor it, but I think it\u2019s prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. And if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we\u2019re evaluating things with respect to resources. We\u2019re being flexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. By the way, we don\u2019t know that the environment is going to get worse. The environment might get better, too. So I just think it\u2019s a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense.  Now with respect to our targets, I want to be clear, we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. And we don\u2019t see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. I\u2019m not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way. But I would say in what\u2019s been certainly a very difficult first half of the year, if you think about the headwinds we\u2019ve faced in both public equity markets because of the war in Ukraine and the unwind of the business in Russia, etcetera, I think there have been some exogenous events in this first half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. So we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them. Christian Bolu : Okay, thanks. Maybe switch over to the consumer business. I wanted to get your latest thinking on that business. How is the profitability curve tracking? How are you thinking about that business going into a downturn? And then just strategically, given the pressures on fin-techs out there, I\u2019m wondering if there is any sort of opportunity here to try and grow faster, either organically or inorganically. David Solomon : Sure. I appreciate the question. And I guess I\u2019d just step back and I\u2019d highlight that we\u2019ve been building a business from scratch here. It certainly takes investment, and we\u2019ve been making investment. And we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we have a long-term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business. Now we\u2019ve been at it, as I think you know, for 5 years. We\u2019ve built out a really good deposit platform. We built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology. We have a loans platform. We have some technology around an invest platform, and we\u2019ve also added GreenSky. With that portfolio of product offerings, we\u2019ve told you at our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. You can obviously see this quarter that we\u2019re making progress on revenue in the business. And as we noted, I think when we spoke in February, at the update, we said the vast majority of the build cost associated with the products that will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. And so I\u2019d remind you of that comment. On a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business. And just a reminder, CECL requires very, very significant upfront reserve build. So we continue to feel good about the progress we\u2019re making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to Goldman Sachs over time. And we\u2019re committed to the journey that we\u2019ve set out on to make sure that we do just that over time. Christian Bolu : Okay, thank you. David Solomon : I just \u2013 the one thing I realized, Christian, that I didn\u2019t touch on is we\u2019re very, very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic. When there was enormous uncertainty, we tightened the credit box meaningfully. As Denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don\u2019t see significant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer. But given tightening economic conditions, we\u2019re watching that very, very carefully. And to the degree that we saw different signals in the short-term, we would adjust our credit box very dynamically. Christian Bolu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David Solomon : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So maybe just as a follow-up on the credit discussion, I was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan growth. You noted that you could be very dynamic but just given some of the upward pressure on provision from both growth math as well as the macro deterioration. I was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how we should be thinking about through-the-cycle provision expectation and a more normal operating backdrop? Denis Coleman : Steven, thanks. It\u2019s Denis. Let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context. So as we noted, with respect to the consumer portion, that\u2019s really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality. And on the wholesale side, we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook. And when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the first quarter into the second quarter, our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from GDP growth to employment levels to inflation, probability of recession, possibility of stagflation, etcetera. And so we reweighted our scenarios, and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. We continue to invest in our franchise. We think it\u2019s important to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way. Steven Chubak : Very helpful. And maybe just for my follow-up for David on capital. You did cite plans to manage to the lower GSIB surcharge of 3%, I know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as 3.5. I was hoping you could speak to the specific actions you\u2019re taking to mitigate the GSIB score whether we should be contemplating any level of revenue attrition from those actions. And does your ability to manage to that lower GSIB surcharge inform the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback? David Solomon : I appreciate the question. And let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. As monetary and fiscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very, very rapidly. And the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and, therefore, expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the profit opportunity for the firm. That environment has certainly shifted in 2022. And while our clients are still active, they are not active to the same degree that they were in 2021. And you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the street. In stating that we\u2019re focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level, we are making a forward assumption that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year. I note one of the things that I said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion. We will obviously evaluate that and change that. But based on the experience we\u2019ve had over the last 6 months, and the revenue opportunity we\u2019re capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation, and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. But I would think at this point in time, looking at that, Denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we\u2019re certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year. Operator : We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. One of the other areas for capital deployment, obviously, is in growing the consumer business. And I know you\u2019ve got GreenSky into the belt, the General Motors card. Apple\u2019s doing gangbusters. So I just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you\u2019re thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new partnership opportunities or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there? David Solomon : Yes. So thanks, Betsy. So look, I think what I\u2019d say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology, etcetera, that are interested in doing things with us. At the same point, we\u2019ve done a bunch over the course of the last 5 years to build this business. And as we\u2019ve said, we put a couple of big partnerships on the ground in cards. We\u2019ve started an Invest platform. We\u2019re now working to integrate GreenSky. I think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level. Certainly, as we get out to 2023 and 2024, we will be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward. But at the moment, we\u2019re focused on really executing on what we put forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. And then separately on transaction banking, you\u2019ve given us a lot of good metrics along the way on how that business has been building out. Maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there. I would think you\u2019re running ahead of plan based on that or expected to by year-end? And how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or elsewhere? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Hey, Betty, it\u2019s Denis. Maybe I\u2019ll take that one. As you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking business, it\u2019s progress year-to-date and the forward. We continue to improve on each of the metrics that we\u2019ve been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion revenues year-to-date $175 million. And importantly, we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational. Operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter. So we will continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. It\u2019s obviously a profitable business already. And it\u2019s a business, as David highlighted, that benefits from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the firm to grow it incrementally. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, I guess I\u2019m thinking in terms of the trade-offs that you have to make, David, in terms of both capital and expenses. On capital, I mean, you talked about a broader, diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream, but then we get the Fed stress test results and you guys finished in last place, albeit better than last year but still last place. So I guess the regulators don\u2019t see it the same way that you do. And the trade-off between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. And then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower. As you said you\u2019re taking a closer look at that, the trade-off between ensuring good profit margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back. David Solomon : I\u2019m not sure there was a question there. I think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. I mean I would highlight, while it\u2019s a fair comment that our SCB is higher than everyone else\u2019s because of our current business mix, if that\u2019s what you refer to as last place, I would comment for the stress test we came in first place is that we were the only firm that actually saw their SCB decrease and many institutions saw their SCB increase very meaningfully. Now I don\u2019t take that as a victory lap. We\u2019re early in the journey of taking assets off our balance sheet, but I still do think, Mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to continue to make that business much less RWA dense. And I do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in this stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward and future tests as we continue to change that mix. I am not satisfied with where we are on the journey of making the firm more fee-based and more resilient. But I am satisfied that we\u2019ve made meaningful progress. And I think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. And so as someone who\u2019s followed the industry and our firm for quite some time, I think the performance in this environment is reflective of the beginning of that evolution. But you\u2019re exactly right. We have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when they are active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of are \u2013 is our true north of what we\u2019re trying to drive towards. So yes, it\u2019s a balance. I think we\u2019re trying to strike that balance appropriately, and we\u2019re going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we can, striking that balance effectively. Mike Mayo : And on the second part, as it relates to expenses, it sounds like you\u2019re going not quite plan B, but you\u2019re getting ready in case you need a plan B. How long do these deals stay alive before it\u2019s pencils down and they just say, all right, we\u2019re going to wait for the next cycle? I mean, it seems like with every month that passes, the chance that capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines. How long do you and the markets have before things just stay lower for longer? David Solomon : Well, I guess I\u2019d say a couple of things. We always \u2013 I think we\u2019re very nimble allocators of resources, financial resources, human resources. We try to have a very, very flexible, nimble approach. And so of course, we\u2019ve expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we\u2019re going to be cautious. Of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. With respect to capital markets activity, I think I told you at the beginning of the year in our January call on January 15 that I did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. And I wouldn\u2019t call that as normal. So when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. I, don\u2019t think we\u2019re going back to that anytime soon. But I do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. And history would just tell you that, that doesn\u2019t mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. But generally speaking, one of the things that affects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. They have to reset their mind around capital costs. And that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. They have commitments. They have to invest. And as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that\u2019s available to them. And so I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity. Now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difficult longer. But it\u2019s not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we\u2019re headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. It is a little bumpy, and so we\u2019re going to proceed cautiously. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to start on expenses. So you indicated that you\u2019re adjusting the investments, but it sounds more like that\u2019s about slowing the hiring outlook. So maybe the impact there has a lag, and we\u2019re more talking about year-end or even into 2023 and more on the comp side. So curious about, number one, whether that\u2019s a fair interpretation. And then number two, the best way to think about non-comp if we adjust for the legal charge and what \u2013 and maybe some higher BC&E this quarter, is this the right jumping off point for non-comp? Or might some of that expense diligence that you flagged also put some downward pressure on the non-comp line? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure. So two components to your question. And obviously, we manage the firm to an efficiency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the first half of the year, we\u2019ve taken compensation expense down significantly, $3.5 billion less comp expense in the first half versus the first half last year. And at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. As we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year, something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efficiency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. And you\u2019re right, some of that will take time to reflect itself through the P&L. So I think that\u2019s the right expectation. You are correct in anticipating that we\u2019re also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non-compensation expense. Some of them are \u2013 dovetail well with investments that we\u2019re making to grow the firm. And some of those activities will obviously look to continue. We may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the firm. And there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inflation, impacting on the overall level of expense. And so that\u2019s just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efficiency target, which is I think the comments and references that both David and I have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks for that color, Denis. Appreciate it. And for the second question, I am curious, we have seen \u2013 you talked a lot about M&A and how, obviously, your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. But just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. So, curious whether or not that\u2019s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability, lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers? David Solomon : I think it\u2019s a good \u2013 I think it\u2019s an appropriate thing to look at carefully. I would say, at the moment, real availability issues are limited to some very, very stressed borrowers or some very, very out-of-favor sectors. But I do think sometimes people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. And so I would say, at the moment, the bigger thing that\u2019s slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment. Ultimately, companies need to raise capital. They find that new clearing price. But I do think if the environment stays very, very difficult from an economic perspective, there are certain sectors where availability is an issue. And there are a couple of them now. I would point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully. And so I think we will watch this very cautiously. But again, I would tell you that there is a mindset when you go through this in a resetting that\u2019s going on, and I think ultimately, markets find clearing prices. And capital markets, there is certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. The most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment. Denis Coleman : I mean another thing I would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity. So, as an example, in our FICC financing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for financing. They have important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have financed. And to the extent that there is less availability of financing across the street, that presents an opportunity for us given the way that we are currently positioned, our focus on financing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning David and Denis. A question on the RIA custody offering, can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of that offering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of that offering in the coming quarters? There has been some recent press suggesting that you guys are better integrating that with the broader Goldman capability. So, I would love to just get an update on your thinking there? David Solomon : Well, we obviously \u2013 we made an acquisition in the space. It\u2019s something that we are focused on as an opportunity for the firm. But I would say, at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small. But I think as we look forward over the course of the next 3 years to 5 years, it will be an area that we see opportunity in and we will turn more focus to expanding. That\u2019s why we made this acquisition and we think it\u2019s an interesting opportunity for us. Devin Ryan : Okay, great. Thanks. And then a follow-up here, Denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of firms in the industry. It didn\u2019t seem to impact your trading or financing results. But can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? Is there another leg that could exist here or clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well? Denis Coleman : Sure. I appreciate the question. I mean connecting it back to some of the comments that Dave has made looking back over the course of the last couple of years, we have gone through an extraordinary period. We see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment. I am sure there are some clients that have looked to de-lever themselves and position for the current operating environment. We continue to see very high levels of client opportunity. There was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them intermediate risk, other clients looking for financing, which is why we had record performance in FICC financing. And I think as we look forward, we are obviously starting the quarter with a buffer to our minimum capital position. We remain very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. We think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turned to us to help them navigate the opportunities. So, I think we are \u2013 we feel well set up, and we are optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on the strategic targets, David. So, you said multiple times on the call that you don\u2019t see any reason why Goldman won\u2019t achieve I think your ROTE target 15% to 17% by \u201824. When we think about that, I think when investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and how quickly you can flex expenses. Just give us a sense of when we think about year-to-date ROTE about 13%, the journey from here to your targets, how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more profitable without any improvement in the macro? David Solomon : Well, if we stayed in a macro \u2013 if we stayed in a macro environment, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a good question. I understand where the question comes from. If we stayed in the macro environment, like the first six months of this year for the next 5 years, I think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns. Although I do think that we would be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly, by the way, not just Goldman Sachs, if you really have that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, etcetera, over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders. I don\u2019t expect \u2013 I think we had a very \u2013 I think this has been a very difficult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. I don\u2019t expect to have the same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that the environment couldn\u2019t be worse or there couldn\u2019t be different headwinds that create different issues. But I think to kind of take what\u2019s going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a 3-year or 4-year thing forward, that\u2019s just not our base case. That\u2019s not our base case. And if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes, investments in the business, etcetera, but that\u2019s not our base case. And so we continue to move forward with the base case, where we are pretty confident that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns. And I would just highlight that, in the first half of the year, we are not that far off from what we said we need to accomplish over the next 3 years. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And then just \u2013 and recognizing it\u2019s very challenging to predict trading activity. But when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility, do you see \u2013 just given all the uncertainty on macros for central bank actions, etcetera, this in terms of fixed trading, things to remain strong as we think about the back half of the year, just whatever is in your crystal ball? David Solomon : Well, the good volatility, bad volatility has never been an expression that I would like. I think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients, and we re making sure that we are meeting their needs. That\u2019s why we have been very focused over the last 3 years, 4 years on really improving our approach to our clients, really improving our market share with our clients, adding financing as a capability to our clients, which is much more resilient and therefore, puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there can\u2019t be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. I am not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward, but I think the investments we have made and our client focus and our market shares and our financing business all give those markets businesses more balanced as we go forward. There will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and there will be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet, but we are prepared to serve them. And I think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter and continue to look over a 3-year period, there is a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. David Solomon : Good morning. Operator : We will move on to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserves on Slide 11. And I just wanted to ask specifically on the consumer book, you have got about 13% reserves to loans. Obviously, charge-offs are only 2% and change. But how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning or just a more tough macro environment, how would you frame that? Denis Coleman : Sure. I think I would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. So, your seasoning point is fair as well. It\u2019s a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. There is an element of seasoning. There is an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to call us \u2013 that that\u2019s the appropriate place to be. You do make reference to charge-offs. Obviously, firm-wide, they are flat quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, down slightly. Consumer is up a little bit. But those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I know earlier you were asked about kind of through the cycle provisioning. And anything specifically on consumer charge-offs as we think about those portfolios, what you would expect once you have the seasoning and what those levels would be, not in a recession, but just more kind of through the cycle? Denis Coleman : Yes. I mean I think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation, so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year. The starting point \u2013 the overall health of the consumer is very strong. The credit environment for consumers has been very, very benign. And so I think you need to take stock of sort of where you are starting from. Obviously, if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we would expect an increase in that regard. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. David, in the past couple of years, you guys have focused on reducing your equity portfolio so that the volatility in earnings would be less. Can you share with us where you are in that progress? Are you at a level that you are comfortable with, or you still got some more to go in reducing that portfolio? David Solomon : Sure. I will answer at a very high level, and then I am going to have Denis walk you through some specific details. I am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. Comfortable is probably the wrong word. I am pleased with the progress. I would like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. And I think we are going to do \u2013 we are going to make progress over the course of the coming 12 months, 24 months. Our progress \u2013 we have made a lot of progress. It was slowed also by the fact that went through a period in 2021 where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. But why don\u2019t I have Denis walk you through some high-level numbers that we have put out there? Denis Coleman : Yes. So, a couple of things. I think we are \u2013 we are well on our way in terms of the journey. We remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel. You will note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter. We continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. We have a detailed asset-by-asset plan that we are executing on. And looking at our results coming through CCAR, Obviously, the Fed recognized our strong PPNR, but we also suspect that the way they concluded the ultimate decision around SCB had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks that they choose to apply against that portfolio. And so that\u2019s incremental affirmation that we have selected the right strategy. And then if anything, we should continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute. But I think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ECM business. Obviously, according to the Dealogic numbers, the first six months of this year, we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver. But David, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. Was it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? Was it lower valuations that pushed them there? What did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry, not just for you folks? David Solomon : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination, Gerard, of all those things. You had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. You also had real volatility. And so people go down the road, doing an IPO, it\u2019s like a tanker. It\u2019s heading down the road. It takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. And you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. And all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. They can\u2019t turn on a dime and get everybody\u2019s mind reset. And so I think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. The period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. And then in March 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. It was the beginning of a decline in the NASDAQ, where the NASDAQ ultimately went down 85%. I am not saying that that\u2019s going to happen again here. But really, equity issuance shutoff in late 2001 and 2002 was a really, really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. And so there is a reset process with all of this. And I think we are on the journey of people\u2019s expectation around valuations being reset. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Can I just \u2013 I just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% GSIB and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year. But I think on the flip side, you guys are pretty optimistic around growing \u2013 still growing the financing business. It looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or flat year-over-year. Loans are up, balance sheet is up. So, is this just something about balance sheet and RWA growth slowing or is there specific areas you think will shrink or you can cut? Denis Coleman : So, I think we are looking at this holistically. A lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute to hit targets over time, given the environment that we are in right now, we see an opportunity to target a 3% GSIB. Obviously, it\u2019s for the benefit of 2024, and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. And so in terms of our ability to target that level, given what we have seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity, etcetera, we think we can do that reasonably efficiently. We have had discussions with our business leaders. They know that, that\u2019s the plan. That\u2019s what they are working on. David did make a comment that should the environment change significantly or the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate. But the current plan is to target that level of GSIB. And we have been obviously growing resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. But in addition to targeting a 3% GSIB we can, at the same time, deploy other financial resources to attractive client opportunities. So, our expectation is that we will be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a 3% GSIB. Jim Mitchell : Well, can you help us a little bit with the specifics of what you are actually targeting, or is that you are unwilling to disclose that? Denis Coleman : We are currently targeting a 3% GSIB. We are not putting out a particular GSIB score that we are targeting. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Try this again here. Just wanted to follow-up on the $20 billion of commitments in \u2013 or third-party funds that you highlighted in the quarter, clearly, there is still strong momentum. As you think about this market backdrop and the outlook for that is there \u2013 are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing? David Solomon : I would say, Dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing significant change in behavior. When you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have significant allocations. Obviously, if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. But I think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, I still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that\u2019s very, very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. I would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail flow into the alternative space. And there my insight there is that is slowing, but it\u2019s not turned off and it\u2019s still adequate. And from what I can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very, very high-end private wealth business, there is still significant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. If the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful. Dan Fannon : Great. And then just as a follow-up on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments. You have historically given a line of sight number on these calls given I would assume the market backdrop in the short-term, there is just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here. Denis Coleman : I think that\u2019s right. So, last quarter, we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up happening. Right now, line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment that\u2019s what we see right now. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : We just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call. Obviously, if any other questions arise, feel free to give me a call directly. Thanks so much. We will speak to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined this morning by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. Global economy continues to face significant headwinds. Inflation remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in decades. Meanwhile, equity markets are well off the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and GDP growth expectations are declining. Many of these trends accelerated towards the end of the quarter. For example, while our own financial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year, we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in mid-August. Everywhere I go, macro themes dominate. My conversations with CEOs, they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans. As we head into the fourth quarter, my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled, though economic performance will vary by region. I also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased that Goldman Sachs delivered solid results during third quarter. As I\u2019ve said before, the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key differentiator for us and client engagement remains strong. For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 11% and a return on tangible equity of 12%.  Before handing it over to Denis to review the quarterly results in detail, I would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution. Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Four years ago, we set out to enhance our client engagement efforts with a goal of further strengthening our world-class client franchise. Our One Goldman Sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor, starting with a 30 client pilot, evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the firm. One Goldman Sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations, proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance. These efforts have produced leading share gains, particularly in our core businesses, and have resulted in a 40% book value per share growth since our Investor Day in 2020.  The execution of One Goldman Sachs over the last four years has amplified two foundational elements of our firm. First, the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our Investment Banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly. Second, the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a significant multiplier effect and drives market share. Because of this, we're making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy. Changes will further strengthen our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efficiency.  As you can see on Page 3, we are integrating our Asset and Wealth Management businesses, as well as our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses into two important segments of the firm. We will also create a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate our fintech platforms from across the firm, including Transaction Banking, Consumer Partnerships, and GreenSky. This segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. We will further integrate our direct-to-consumer activities into Wealth Management given the growing convergence of Wealth and Consumer banking. We will report our full year 2022 earnings using these three segments and will also host an Investor Day on February 28, 2023. We look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses, although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal financial targets. We are excited about the role that Asset and Wealth Management will play in our forward growth plans. Across Asset and Wealth Management, we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice, solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets. Running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our $10 billion and $2 billion management fee targets. Our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum, particularly in alternatives and Wealth Management.  We also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a significant growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs. Through our strengthening capabilities in Workplace and Personal Wealth, we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve. This expanded offering is a direct response to a clear push from C-Suite leaders for more democratized suite of advice and solutions. It's also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking offering, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace. Over the past few years, Global Markets and Investment Banking have been increasingly operating as a unified, leading, world-class franchise. We are the advisor of choice supported by a #1 league table positions across M&A and ECM, and we continue to bolster our leading position as a market maker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe. As the world has gotten more complex and our clients' demands have evolved, we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both Global Markets and Investment Banking to meet their needs. Synergies across these businesses from advice, financing, risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver differentiated solutions to our clients. This creates a significant multiplier effect and has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years. Running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share. Turning to Page 4. Platform Solutions is an end-to-end primarily cloud-based technology platform business that embeds our best-in-class financial products and services into our clients' ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers. In recent years, we saw opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise, world-class risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process, diversify our revenues and funding mix. We have built and launched a Transaction Banking platform, a digital Consumer Banking platform, the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired GreenSky. These platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as Apple, General Motors, Stripe, American Express and Fiserv. Through our relationships with Apple and General Motors, we already have the ability to access more than 100 million individuals in the U.S. Combination of our brand in Apple is unique as proven by the reaction to Apple Card, which has been ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by J.D. Power. We have also extended our partnership to new products. This last week, we introduced a new Goldman Sachs savings account for Apple Card that allows users to grow their rewards in a high yield savings account and to add funds to a linked banking account or directly from Apple Cash. This embeds a high yield savings account from Goldman Sachs directly into the Apple Card experience in Apple Wallet. Goldman Sachs and Apple are committed to expanding our relationship, and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers with healthier financial lives. In Transaction Banking, we are delivering a differentiated developer-centric cloud-based product that allows for seamless integration into our clients' ecosystems. We are extremely encouraged by the client feedback and adoption rate of the offering. We now have approximately 425 active clients, with greater than $70 billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena. Our priority in Platform Solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify Goldman Sachs revenue and funding while driving profitability. We will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our Investor Day in February. Let me now address some additional details on our Consumer business. Since 2016, we've made a significant investment. And on Page 5, you can see what we've achieved as a result. We serve over 15 million customers and generated more than $2.2 billion in revenues in the last 12 months. We've learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business, and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward. Turning to Page 6. For our direct-to-consumer strategy, we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like Workplace and Personal Wealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale. The purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs. In Workplace and Personal Wealth alone, we already have the ability to reach over 9 million individuals. Our Marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader efforts. We will continue to grow the deposit offering and the level of service that has generated over [$110 billion] of retail deposits. We believe that all of our customers across all products will benefit from this reprioritization. Before I turn it over to Denis to go through the results for the quarter, I want to highlight the following. Over the last four years, this leadership team has been working hard to grow, diversify and strengthen Goldman Sachs. Our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey, setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value. Consistent with our strategy, we are focusing on the execution -- we're focusing our execution on 3 key priorities, as you can see on Page 7, which are to grow management fees, maximize wallet share and grow financing activities and scale Platform Solutions to deliver pretax profitability. We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day in February. I will now turn it over to Denis. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 8 of the presentation. As David mentioned, we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of $8.25. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered a return on common equity of 12.2% and a return on tangible equity of 13.1%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 9. Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% versus a very strong quarter a year ago. Financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41% versus record performance in the third quarter last year. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our #1 league table position year-to-date and expanded our lead. Equity underwriting net revenues were $241 million, reflecting limited industry-wide activity. Nonetheless, we continue to rank #1 year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings. Debt underwriting net revenues were $328 million, given muted issuance volumes across both high yield and investment grade.  While activity remained slow this quarter, our backlog is robust, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting. Our advisory dialogues continue to be strong, though clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of certain deal and financing-related activity. Corporate lending generated net revenues of $35 million as solid performance in middle market lending and Transaction Banking was largely offset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending. Moving to Global Markets on Page 10. Segment net revenues were $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year, as client engagement and activity remains strong. Financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth, comprising approximately 30% of the total revenues in this segment. Turning now with FICC on Page 11. Revenues were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year. We saw strength across our rates, currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility. In FICC financing, we generated a 41% increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending. We remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients' financing needs. Our FICC lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized. Moving to Equities. Net revenues in the third quarter were $2.7 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 19% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment and lower client activity. In Equities financing, we generated near-record revenues of $1.1 billion as we supported client financing activities despite lower prime balances. Moving to Asset Management on Page 12. Asset Management net revenues were $1.8 billion. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, roughly flat relative to last quarter and up 42% year-over-year, reflecting management fees from NNIP and the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds. Equity investments generated revenues of $527 million in the third quarter. More specifically, our public equity portfolio produced approximately $215 million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments. Across our private portfolio, we generated approximately $310 million of net revenues. We saw event-driven gains of over $350 million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly $150 million from our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $200 million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and TMT sectors. Given current market conditions, our harvesting of on-balance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter, but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. We continue to make progress on our fundraising targets, securing $12 billion of alternative commitments this quarter. We also closed West Street Capital Partners VIII, our flagship private equity fund, which at $9.7 billion was significantly above its original target. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $231 million, primarily reflecting net interest income of $267 million. I'll now turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 14. We produced record net revenues of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, up 18% versus a year ago, driven by significantly higher net revenues in Consumer Banking. For the quarter, despite the market headwinds, management and other fees of $1.2 billion were relatively flat sequentially as net market depreciation was largely offset by strong client net inflows. Private banking and lending net revenues reached a record of $395 million, up 35% year-over-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $744 million in the third quarter, nearly double the third quarter of 2021, reflecting higher credit card balances and improved deposit spreads. Moving on to Page 15. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the third quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. On Page 16, total firm-wide net interest income of $2 billion in the third quarter was up 18% relative to the second quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $177 billion, up slightly versus the second quarter as growth in credit cards and Wealth Management loans was offset by a decrease in real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses was $515 million, primarily driven by growth in our consumer lending portfolio, net charge-offs and worsening economic indicators, particularly in Europe. The credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient as reflected by minimal net impairments in the quarter. On the Consumer side, though we are seeing some signs of credit deterioration and an increase in charge-offs, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations. That said, we're closely monitoring the portfolio and actively using our underwriting in light of the softening macroeconomic outlook. Let's turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion. Our compensation ratio year-to-date net of provisions was 32.5%. Through the third quarter, our compensation and benefits expenses are down over 20% relative to 2021. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by ongoing integration and run rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions, $191 million in litigation reserves and higher transaction-based expenses. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency. As we've previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts, and we expect that these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time. Turning to capital on Slide 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially and representing a 100 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement. In the third quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million. As a reminder, our GSIB surcharge will increase by 50 basis points in January 2023, bringing our CET1 ratio requirement to 13.8%. We will continue to target a buffer of 50 basis points to 100 basis points above this requirement. In conclusion, our solid third quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We are mindful of the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, and we will prudently manage our resources and maintain a risk-sensitive orientation as we continue to serve our clients. I share David's enthusiasm of the opportunities ahead of us. The further alignment of our businesses will help drive the organization forward. Successful execution of our strategic priorities, growing management fees, maximizing wallet share and scaling platform solutions will further strengthen the firm and unlock shareholder value. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate your macro comments. I was wondering, in private markets specifically, I feel like those markets have changed as well or hopefully only temporary, but great time to be a private lender in private credit. And you're big in that, but not as a great time to be in private equity for marks or capital raising. So I wonder if you could talk as both manufacturer and distributor, just maybe a state of the union in general and then if you could weave that into your thoughts on your gross alternative fundraising target of $225 billion and $2 billion in management fees. David Solomon : Sure. So thanks for the question, Glenn. And look, at a high level, the targets remain in place. And our confidence in the targets and our ability to deliver those targets is high, and we're very focused on them. We continue to make progress in the fundraising, and we highlighted it in the context of the script. And we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next 18 months. And while certainly I'd say that private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternative fundraising environment is broadly more constrained, I would highlight just the fact that we have a very, very broad franchise, a very, very diverse sense of offering at -- sets of offerings and that there's a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this. And I actually think from a vintage perspective, the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then when we look back, it's probably something that will be very, very attractive. We're obviously shifting the macro environment, as we've talked about. That's going to create headwinds around valuations, and there's been a big reset. On the other hand, if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies -- you highlighted some. I think lending strategies will be quite attractive in this environment. I think there's good institutional capital and, candidly, good capital out of the wealth channel still available to support these strategies. So we're taking a long-term approach to growing these businesses. The businesses are growing nicely. We've set targets that we'll continue to meet. And I know that if we have a good broad offering for our clients, that we'll continue to have success in this. And candidly, this is one of the reasons why we're integrating Asset and Wealth Management is as we believe by putting these platforms together, we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance. Denis Coleman : And Glenn, I can add from an alternatives perspective, we mentioned growth of $12 billion in new commitments in the quarter. That brings year-to-date to $57 billion, just shy of $60 billion. We now sit at $164 billion towards our increased $225 billion target. We continue to migrate our alternatives into AUS that sits now at $256 billion of alternatives AUS. So despite the environment, we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals, particularly in alternatives. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for that, Denis, and David. Maybe a related follow-up on RWA. Is that a little bit in the quarter? I appreciate you took share and lots of volatility, so that has a bunch of moving parts. But curious your just overall approach towards optimizing RWA. And then maybe a specific question related to FICC financing. And it was up 41%. It's great, making good money. Does that come at paying better or worse return on risk-weighted assets as intermediation? Denis Coleman : Glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on RWA. As you note, our RWAs were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We have been focused on managing our RWA footprint tightly. Within that number, you'll see reductions in terms of market-based RWAs and increases in credit RWAs. And we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy RWA capacity to drive efficiencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. And FICC financing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our RWA deployment. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the FICC financing line. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start with a question on expenses. You spoke of expense mitigation efforts as part of the broader realignment strategy. What's the level of non-comp inflation we should be contemplating? Recognizing we're still dealing with inflationary headwinds. You alluded to more proactive measures to mitigate expense growth. Just want to get a sense if the goal is to actually slow non-comp growth or to deliver absolute reductions in expense. David Solomon : Thanks for the question, Steven. I'll start at just a high level, and then Denis will go to the details with you in terms of how we're thinking about it. But I do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth, but one is there is definitely an inflationary pressure that's affecting certain aspects of the business. We're obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully. I do think we're making investments across the platform, particularly in certain technology infrastructure, and that's having an impact in the medium-term. We think those are investments that we need to make. At the same point, though, given the environment, we're extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can. Now there are going to be headwinds given the natural inflation that sets in, but why don't I have Denis kind of walk through and break down some of the different components that we've been focused on? Denis Coleman : Sure. So if we take a step back, we look at our overall level of operating expenses year-to-date, they're down 6% compared to the prior year-to-date period. They are up 1% sequentially, drivers obviously across both comp and non-comp. If you look at the non-compensation growth over the course of the last year, roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of NNIP and GreenSky together with change in litigation. So that is representing about half. On the balance, as David indicated, we do see some impact from inflation. We do see the impact of higher levels of transaction-based expenses, but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non-compensation category where we can. You may note that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we reduced our professional fees, something that we indicated in our previous earnings release. And we're going to continue to think very, very disciplined about the way in which we deploy non-compensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efficiency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the firm. Steven Chubak : That's great. And maybe just a question for my follow-up on the equity investment portfolio. Given the challenging equity market backdrop, certainly, the revenues came in better than expected. There's also been some increased scrutiny more favorable marks on some of these private equity portfolios. And just given the better revenue outcome and a pretty heavy concentration in areas like TMT and real estate, which have come under pressure, I was hoping you could speak to what drove some of the better results this quarter, anything idiosyncratic worth flagging? Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you, Steven. Let me cover that in a bit of detail for you. So obviously, on the $527 million equity line, there's a number of components. As we mentioned previously, we have a public equity portfolio, and that contributed positively north of $200 million for the third quarter. And then also within the private portfolio, you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio. We have roughly $0.5 billion of event-driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter, whether those be capital raising activities, strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our CIEs, those positive gains were offset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio, particularly in TMT and Consumer. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just going back, David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rationalize spend. The segment realignment makes a ton of sense. Just give us a sense from the outside as we think about the rationalization of the spend, does this lead to you achieving your strategic targets around costs, ROE at a faster pace? Or do you have a high degree of confidence that you get there relative to the previous plan and understanding the core tenants are the same? But just give us a sense of just your confidence in achieving those targets despite the market backdrop as we look forward and how does the alignment supports that? David Solomon : Sure. And so first, I just want to amplify, I said in the script, we continue to be committed to our forward targets. And there's nothing about the environment or the way we're running the firm that doesn't lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years, whether the return target or also the efficiency target that we've set. And we're tracking a number of KPIs and continue to be very focused on that. The realignment of the firm is really driven by our ability to serve clients. That is the most important thing that's coming out of this. And we've been very, very focused on wallet share and client share broadly. We've made real improvements over the last few years, and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability. Now in this realignment, we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our direct-to-consumer business. And I'd just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our direct-to-consumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower. And so of course, as you look at that, that's helpful in the overall returns of the firm. But I would highlight that just the numbers, either way we were looking at it are small in the context of businesses, our core businesses, banking and markets, asset and wealth management. And I don't think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which we will meet our targets. We do think, and this is why we're doing this, that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward. And so that's why we've made this purposeful shift. But again, I'd just amplify, these are not big numbers in the context of our meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the firm. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess just one follow-up in terms of -- you talked about organic growth opportunities in private lending given market dislocations. There are a lot of asset values that have been hit, too. Just remind us in terms of M&A, where you're focused on and just appetite to execute M&A. David Solomon : Well, at the moment, we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us. As you know, we made a couple of acquisitions. We're in the process of integrating those acquisitions in. And at the moment, that's where our focus lies. As we go forward in the future, if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth, particularly in Asset and Wealth Management, we'll consider them. But at the moment, we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Christian Bolu : Just trying to better understand the point of the reorganization of the businesses. What does this reorg mean practically for the businesses? What can they do today that they couldn't be before the reorg? I guess kind of when I listen to you, other than scaling back on consumer acquisition, I'm struggling to understand what the broader point of the reorg really is? David Solomon : Christian, we've been -- it's interesting because I know you follow us closely, and we've been talking about a variety of things in this. If you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year, we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned. We also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between Asset and Wealth. And then when John spoke at the Bernstein conference in May, we put a big, big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing Asset Management and Wealth Management closer together. So it's not that by doing this that we're doing something dramatically different. We've been driving the firm in this direction with respect to client service and One GS for a number of years. And we think as we've done that and we've looked at that and we've learned, we think by organizing the firm this way, it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how we're operating against that client set. And so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients. And so that's why we've moved in this direction. That's with the big businesses, banking and markets and Asset and Wealth Management. On Platform Solutions, we have a bunch of these platforms where we're making investments. We think they're very interesting. They're growing. They require more focus. This alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter, more transparent light on them. And we're very committed to driving them to profitability and a meaningful contribution over time. And we think by organizing this way, it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business, but one that I think in the future allows us a differentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients. Christian Bolu : Got you. Okay. Maybe switching on to Consumer. I mean just looking back over time, what lessons have you guys learned in terms of trying to execute in this business? If I think about the thesis that Goldman outlined as far back as 2016 in terms of building a full-scale digital bank, that was a great thesis, right? It's actually played out. You've seen a bunch of smaller new banks like Square and Chime really do a good job of building that. One could argue that there's been some execution challenges for Goldman on Consumer. You've had multiple leadership changes. Now it feels like we're sort of breaking up some of the businesses and putting them in different parts of the organization. So just stepping back a little bit here, kind of what lessons have you learned in terms of execute on Consumer? And what is that -- how do you take that going forward to build that business? David Solomon : Well, I think, Christian, what -- the steps that we've taken today are reflective of the learnings. And whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things, you're always going to be constantly looking and examining what you're doing and saying what have we learned, how can we do this better? I'd say I'm very proud of the team in our Consumer business, the markets team broadly. When I look at the deposit platform that's been built and the growth from zero to over $110 billion of deposits over the last six years, we have 15 million customers on the platform. I think we have a very unique credit card technology that's differentiated. We have a couple of extraordinary partnerships. I think that when you look at all of that together, we have some very good things, but one of the things I think we've learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers and the direct-to-consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way. And so we're focusing it by aligning it with our Wealth business where we have access to millions of people. And so I still see a terrific opportunity to take what a really, really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our Wealth business, provide those products and services to clients and customers at Goldman Sachs.  In addition, I think the partnerships that we've built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very, very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients. And so yes, there have been bumps. Not everything has been perfect. I think that always happens when you're innovating. But I also think we've built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the firm as we go forward. And in particular, our ability to have a more diversified funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to offer Wealth customers on our platform a broad array of services, I think, positions us well as we move forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : So two questions. First, a follow-up on the conversation just now. Is there anything that you're going to be fading as a result of this? Is there any part of the Consumer business that you're not going to do anymore? And I know you did the renegotiation with Apple Card. I guess it's through 2029, if I got it right. And how is that restructured in a way to enhance your ability to generate revenues from that? Because I know you mentioned on CNBC this morning, David, that the balances aren't being carried as much as had been expected. David Solomon : So there's no -- the first part of your question, Betsy, there's no aspect of the services that we're offering to consumers that we don't continue to offer. The big thing, though, is this alignment that we are aligned with our Wealth business, and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people. With respect to the Apple Card, I made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with Apple. I just highlighted that it's very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this. But I think it goes to the fact that it's a very, very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity, but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology and Apple's platform, there were different results than we had expected. I mean one of the positive results was very, very good for consumers, if consumers have an ability and, therefore, are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly. That led to different modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you'd have with a certain population on the platform. And so in looking at the forward arrangement, the platform has to work for both us and Apple. Apple believe that. We believe that. And so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital financial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform. Betsy Graseck : And then just on a separate topic, but the question is on the GSIB surcharge. And I think over the past couple of quarters, you've highlighted how you've been looking to take action to bring your GSIB score down such that you don't trip into that next 50 bp bucket in Jan '24. Could you give us a sense as to the progress there this quarter and if that goal is still on the table for year-end? Denis Coleman : Betsy, it's Denis. Thanks for that question. Our position is, we remain focused on targeting the 3% GSIB, same message we gave at the end of the second quarter. We're one quarter closer to the end of the year. We are on track to achieve the 3% GSIB level. As we indicated in the second quarter, I would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change, we could pivot away from that. But from where we sit right now today, looking into year-end, we remain focused on the 3% GSIB. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : I have two easy questions that I'll requeue for, but I'll ask my harder questions now, if I'm able to requeue. On Slide 5, you say that Consumer revenues were $2.2 billion for the last 12 months. What were the earnings for the Consumer? And the reason I ask that is there's all sorts of news articles, and I'm not sure if it's a lot of money. And I just don't know if that's the case or not or to what degree, and that makes sense in any start-up that you'd be investing along the J curve and you lose money at first and you make money down the road. So how is Consumer from a financial standpoint, from an earnings standpoint panning out in relation to your original expectations? David Solomon : So Mike, we're not giving complete transparency on the four-wall look at the Consumer business. It doesn't make money at the moment. I'm not going to go further than that. But what I will say, the deposits are hugely valuable. And we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that we've had, so you're not front-loading reserves the same way, that what we're doing will deliver accretive returns to the firm. And so we continue to feel very, very confident with that. Not everything that's reported is accurate and reflects the journey of innovating and building something like this, but we continue to feel very good about what we've built. We're making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools, this activity contributing to the firm. I'd highlight that the overall performance and the firm -- the firm's overall performance and our targets remain the same. And so again, I know this gets a lot of attention. I understand why it gets a lot of attention, and that's all okay. But we've set targets. We're going to deliver on those targets, and we're going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the firm, and this is one of them. Michael Mayo : All right. I guess the reason I asked the question -- I mean, look, for the last five, 10, 20, 150 years, right, your strength has been serving your corporate relationships, investment banking. And look, that's your legacy, too, the strength there. And so when I'm looking at this third division, Platform Solutions, the first two divisions are based on how you address the clients based on distribution, One Goldman Sachs. Whereas the third division, Platform Solution, seems to be based on how you manufacture solutions. So that just seems like a little disconnect. So just a little bit more color. I know you'll talk about it at your newly announced Investor Day, but distribution, and this is based on how you manufacture clients. I'm just trying to reconcile with the Goldman Sachs history and what you're doing elsewhere. David Solomon : Well, I appreciate that, Mike. And look, it's very generous of you to account 150 years of history, but I just highlight firm looked very different in the 1860s than it looked in the 1920s, than it looked in the 1960s. The firm continues to grow and change. I joined Goldman Sachs in 1999, and it was 23 years ago as a partner, it was a fraction of what Goldman Sachs is today. So we're a big business. We have very big businesses. And of course, our Investment Banking and markets business is core to who we are. It will continue to be core to who we are. It drives our earnings and performance. It drives what we're associated with. . We've built over a number of decades a very, very powerful Asset and Wealth Management business, what we're bringing together today. We're the fifth largest active asset manager in the world, and we think we've got a real opportunity to grow that. I understand now that people accept that as being core to Goldman Sachs. When we started back in the '80s, I don't think people viewed it as core. But we also have 11,000 engineers here, and we're doing some very, very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology. After the financial crisis, the regulatory structure came, and we became a bank. And it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding. And so what Platform Solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of Goldman Sachs that we're investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients. We've, I think, done some very interesting things in Transaction Banking, as we've outlined. I think this card partnership is very, very interesting in terms of what it's allowing us to do. And so we think it's an opportunity. It's still small relative to Goldman Sachs. It's less than 5%, but we think it's an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what Goldman Sachs can do for our clients. And that's kind of the way we're thinking about it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. . Brennan Hawken : I've got two questions and one is on the Consumer pivot, but I feel like we need a break. So let me just add the other one first. You guys -- how should we be thinking about the efficiency ratio this year? The last six months have been tougher revenue-wise. And so the medium -- we've been above your medium-term target of 50 -- 60%, sorry. Non-comp expense is a little sticky. You guys laid out some of the things that you're trying to do there. But do you think that -- do you fully expect that you'll be hitting your 60% ratio target this year on the efficiency front? Denis Coleman : Brennan, I'll take that for you. Thanks for the question. As David indicated earlier, we remain very committed to our firm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. The efficiency ratio is one of those. We will not necessarily hit that target each and every year. This is probably one of those years. It's not been a top quartile environment for performance. But that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. You'll note that our compensation and benefits on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. And we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. And finally, remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. But you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efficiency ratio. And then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efficiency target. David Solomon : But Brennan, just to amplify, we're committed to our efficiency target. It was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way. And so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment, and it's having an impact. But we remain committed to the target and are operating the firm to deliver on that target. Brennan Hawken : Great. And then for the next one, just to come back to the -- pivot to Consumer. And apologies for hitting on it again, but I think it's important because want to understand strategically, you all laid out in early 2020, David laid out a lot of the goals and aspirations around Consumer and building this Consumer business. It seems like this shift is a toning down of some of those aspirations. Previously, we had heard that you were looking to launch some general consumer banking to complement the deposit business. And it's -- while you said before that you're not changing the current offering, not completely clear if you're continuing to go forward with the rollout and all of the original aspirations that you were targeting. And just to be honest, when I speak with a lot of investors on Goldman Sachs, very few are excited about the Consumer business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that a pulling back in the aspirations would necessarily be negative. I just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is. David Solomon : Yes. No, Brennan, I appreciate that. There's no question that the aspiration is probably got more communicated in a way that they were broader than where we're now choosing to go. And we are making it clear that we're going back on some of that. Now we have built some things. We have a checking platform. We have an investing platform. And if you are aligning us with wealth and you have wealth customers, wealth customers can use those things, but it's very, very different to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers on mass. And I think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that we're better to play to our strength. And now our focus is -- I think the technology with Gold is very, very good, and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform, and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure. It is a purposeful shift, tried to make that clear in the script. And I think it plays the strength that we have. But we are a bank. We need deposits. We are a wealth platform. People around a wealth platform want an ability to leave money here. Actually, if you look at other wealth platforms, they have banking capabilities attached to them. And so I think we're strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform. And I want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very, very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuff that we've now built. So I think we've made a significant investment. We are narrowing our focus very clearly, but I still think there are opportunities for us. And again, I want to amplify our other businesses are performing. They drive the overall results. This is still small in the overall scheme of Goldman Sachs, but we think that it's additive, and that's why we're trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way. And I appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it. And that certainly affects some of our decision-making. Operator : We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : I want to ask a question just on Investment Banking. M&A financing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals. I'm just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether financing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit. And then kind of interrelated, just how much that's weighing on your outlook for M&A advisory business? And where it sounds like backlogs are still solid, but you need functioning financing as well. David Solomon : Yes. I would say, Devin, at a high level, we're tightening economic conditions very, very quickly. And when you tighten economic conditions, it has an impact on these things. I think the impact lagged a little bit. I do think there's been a big reset in the capital markets for IPOs, for debt financing. People have to get their minds around the valuations, the cost of capital. I think that reset is occurring. History would tell you that capital markets generally don't stay close no matter what the environment. They don't stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward. They have to operate their businesses. They have to raise capital. And so they adjust to the new environment. That said, the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in 2023. And so I think there are going to be headwinds. So I expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and M&A environment as we head into 2023. I think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inflation to really see all that stuff accelerate from the levels it's operating at today. Devin Ryan : Yes. Okay. Great. A quick follow-up here just on deposits. Deposit rate in markets right now, I think, 2.35%. The delta versus many of your bank peers is widening. And so I'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple of months, especially as customer cash sorting has been accelerating in the industry, and then whether you can just share some expectations from here around what you expect in kind of Marcus deposit gathering just as rates potentially continue to move higher from there. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you for that question. So maybe just some observations across deposit flows across the firm given the changing environment. On the consumer side of the equation, continuing to perform and outperform our expectations. Our focus is on continuing to attract deposits. We are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope. And so -- in such a fashion that we can attract deposits. We do not intend to be the price leader, but we do intend to remain competitive. It's obviously an entirely digital offering. We're not burdened with a lot of other cost and infrastructure. And so we have some flexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the firm. Obviously, this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle. But thus far, it's outperforming our own expectations. On the other hand, institutional activity through Transaction Banking, we're observing that, that is more competitive. There is -- there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels, being more disciplined. And so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Wanted to ask about Wealth Management. You had a strong quarter for inflows versus, I think, what we saw in the industry has a bit of a slowdown sequentially, look to be a record inflow quarter for alts for you. Can you just talk about the momentum in that business and how to think about maybe growth from here? Denis Coleman : So thank you for acknowledging that. Obviously, on top of that, our overall growth in management and other fees add up 15% year-over-year; in the last quarter, had almost $2.25 billion. We're well on our way to both our $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. And the reality of attracting these types of flows over this period in time, a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously. Some of these particular flows have longer lead times. Other, shorter lead times. But looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter, looking at the change to our alternatives U.S. on the quarter, which was very strong, and then looking at our inflows across the more traditional channels, we are very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter. And we're very focused on continuing to drive that going forward. Daniel Fannon : Got it. And then just in the Consumer business, both the consumer banking as well as the private banking lending accelerated quarter-over-quarter, and you gave a handful of reasons. But just thinking about the trajectory for those businesses even in addition of -- with the realignment, just trying to think about momentum on more of the shorter-term basis. The step-ups quarter-over-quarter were quite strong. So just some color -- a little additional color there would be helpful. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you. I mean, obviously, for the firm overall, loan growth was just about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. But we do continue to see good opportunities, particularly across the Wealth Management segment. You saw better growth in that segment. It's a high-quality lending opportunity for us. And we're leveraging an existing set of relationships in existing franchise that's very much in place. We've obviously been recognized for our advice and solution-oriented way in serving those clients, but we are finding that increasingly, they're looking for us also to provide financing to them. And so we're making sure that we're very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible. And we see good opportunities on the floor to continue to grow those types of financing activities. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor : May I keep calling for the normalization of fixed income trading? And I think over last quarter, you guys tried to frame what might be a good kind of medium, longer-term level. But obviously, it continues to be. And I am wondering, has it reset higher kind of permanently due to likely higher inflation, higher rates? And usually, that does bring higher volatility. Even if things settle down from here, are we just looking at a structurally bigger and maybe materially bigger wallet than we thought not too long ago? David Solomon : Look, Matt, I think it's always hard to predict. But I think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic, I do think the level of client activity and a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet. I think one of the things that we benefited from, and we continue to try to amplify this, is we've grown our wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. So we're benefiting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years. But in addition, with 300 basis points of wallet share growth, that's also improved our position. So I do think clients are active. We have a truly global franchise. It's broad. It's deep. We're very, very focused on our market share position with the leading clients. I can't tell you what the future will bring, but I just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned. Whatever that opportunity is, our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong. Matthew O'Connor : And in terms of the share gains, how much of it -- so obviously, it sounds that is you're leaning into the business with some investments, including in financing, but how much of it is -- maybe mix has been favorable to you and there's also been some pullback by some global peers as they've been building capital and you obviously have enough to lean into it. David Solomon : Well, it's hard to pull it apart. I mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate, the people who are committed to it, the big U.S. players are going to benefit. But I actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains is the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the firm, the investment in the One Goldman Sachs ethos, I think it's had a material impact on our Global Markets business. And I think it's affected our shares. I think the team in that division has executed in a very, very strong way against that. It\u2019s improved our client relationships, improved our positioning materially with the top 100 clients. I know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we were 40 -- we had 44 of the top 100 that we were in the top 3 with. We're now in the top 3 with over 75. That's been a very coherent -- very focused effort to improve our client positioning. I think that's had the biggest impact on our market shares. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : David, you talked about the need for deposits. And if I recall back on your Investor Day, one of the advantages for growing deposits was the improvement in your funding costs from wholesale funds. With the rise in rates, has that improvement lessened at all? And second, I think you had a goal of getting to 50-50 in terms of funding half of the business with deposits and then wholesale funds. And where do you stand on that? Denis Coleman : So thank you, Gerard. It's Denis. So I think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original Investor Day, we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix, also benefiting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel. We've developed, since that period of time, multiple deposit funding channels. The digital markets platform is one of them. Transaction Banking is another. In terms of that original goal of changing the mix, we have achieved that. We continue to be very, very focused on moving that mix. You'll see on a quarter-over-quarter basis that we have improved our deposits, reduced our other unsecured funding. So we remain focused on that. It's an attractive source of funding for us. It also fits within the overall strategic realignment that we've been discussing. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up in your outlook, David, for what's going on in the capital markets business, obviously, the tightening that we're all seeing. Is it a straightforward in terms of an improvement of the Fed finishing with its monetary tightening and markets rebound quickly after that? Or do you see other factors that have to play in aside from what's going on, of course, with Ukraine and Russia and the European situation? David Solomon : I don't think it's simple for sure, Gerard. I think it's still pretty uncertain. I do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inflation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. The Fed is executing and has sent some very, very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but I think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inflation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. And so I think we're in an uncertain period. I think that this warrants, and we're operating the firm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. But we'll have to watch closely. But I don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the Fed's current trajectory, we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. I think that's still relatively uncertain. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Jeremy Sigee : You've covered a lot of ground, so I've just got a couple of specific follow-ups, please. The first one goes back to the cost topic and the headcount increase in this quarter. I just wondered if that's mainly seasonal with new joiners because I think the acquisition impacts were all already in the prior quarter. So I just wondered if it is just seasonality really that's driving that headcount increase and just how you think about that relative to the cost focus that you've been talking about for a couple of quarters now. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you for that. In terms of a quarter change, a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year. Our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter. We mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity. We have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives. That's to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market. We have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the firm. There's a lot of talent inside of Goldman Sachs. There's also talent outside of Goldman Sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients. So we are focused on overall levels of headcount growth, looking to slow it, but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires. Jeremy Sigee : Very clear. And then a separate follow-up just on the Wealth Management -- Workplace Wealth Management, which I feel is a sort of -- it's a new thing for you to talk about in such a high-profile way. Do you have all the building blocks that you need to be successful and to grow that space? Or are there bits that you're going to have to build to make a success of that? David Solomon : So I appreciate the question, Jeremy. I mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago. It started with the acquisition of Ayco. I'm going to get the date wrong, but it was in the early 2000s. I think it was approximately 18 to 20 years ago, which would -- which allowed us to basically affiliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and financial counseling to executives that then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives. But that business has grown nicely, and that was the building block under which we built this. And today, I think we deal with more than half of the Fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the Fortune 1000. It's through that platform and then with the addition of United Capital, which was investment we obviously made a few years ago, that gave us a broader high net worth footprint that's allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with. And then we've added digital solutions that we've been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team. So we have certain companies that we're partnered with where we're offering financial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees, which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly. So the building blocks are in place. They've been put in place over a long period of time. And over the last couple of years, we've started to execute much more directly across that. And you're right, now we're amplifying what we've invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that we've built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it. But we think it's a big opportunity for the firm. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : I guess the word for the quarter is resiliency, if I'm hearing you correctly. And it's really remarkable that you haven't had a big blow up that's come back to hit you or your peers so far. But how are you protecting yourself against, I guess, the likelihood -- there's going to be some third-party problem that could ricocheted back on you. I'm talking about outside of, say, the largest U.S. banks, which have reported now. And then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines. How long does that last? David Solomon : So Mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. And I just start by the fact that the firm has a very, very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. So I've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that I think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. I think we've taken a number of actions inside the firm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about our RWA allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difficult environment. Now obviously, we have exposure to that because we're a large financial firm. So you can't 100% protect yourself from that. But there is no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. I think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buffer during the quarter. I think that's reflective of a conscious decision in this environment to ran a little bit more cautiously, a little bit more conservatively. We've been watching what's been going on in markets across the UK And when we see things like that, we reflect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be amplified. And so we're extremely focused on issues like that. And I would just say that I think the world is fragile at the moment, and it's uncertain. And we're operating through that lens. We're big financial institutions. So we have exposure. If there were -- if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them. But on the other hand, I think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise. And we're well capitalized, and we're very focused on this. And we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis, whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : Yes. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and thank you for all the questions. If you have any additional questions that come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks so much.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 17, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategic Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information and forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with a review of our financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. FICC and equity activities - activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world class franchise. On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our non-compensation costs. We have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and managed down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right-size the firm for the current environment. We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best. Additionally, we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey. We also narrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally, although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our wealth management clients. For now, our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. We are very focused on developing a path toward profitability and platform solutions and we will provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us \u2013 for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inflation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren\u2019t many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy, but it\u2019s clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We generated double-digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor. That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses : number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability. We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in place around the world to serve our clients\u2019 broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let\u2019s start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year, down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for firm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity, but remain solid, particularly in advisory. That being said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity. While we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some positive signs of activity, particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year-on-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC financing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year. The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client financing activities. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products. Let\u2019s now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach profitability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents a 130 basis point buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So given the capital RWA and expense actions that you have already taken, if 2023 is a little bit better in banking, but it\u2019s kind of the same atmosphere we\u2019ve been in because it feels like it\u2019s lingering. Can you all get closer to your return targets this year? I know it\u2019s very difficult in this backdrop but what I am getting at is do we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions you\u2019ve taken start closing the gap? Thanks. David Solomon : So, thanks, Glenn and I appreciate the question. Obviously, an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. We talk about our targets in a normalized environment. One thing I just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. This certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. And we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very significant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. We reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. But given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it\u2019s not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. And if you look at the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. I don\u2019t think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way. And so I think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. I\u2019d highlight last year, we way outperformed the peer average ROE by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we\u2019re just more sensitive to that. Denis Coleman : I mean things I might add, Glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the [forward] (ph) I think the reason why we\u2019re taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive efficiency even further. And as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe staying up to 50,000, transaction banking is good, but it\u2019s unfortunately a small revenue base. Consumer maybe music to some investors ears is being deemphasized. So I guess my question is, whereas your goal is to build a more durable firm and I share that goal, where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy? Thanks. David Solomon : Well, I think, Glenn, the big thing in that, and it\u2019s always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry. We continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business. We\u2019re continuing to grow our wealth business. Our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. And so it\u2019s that mix change, less balance sheet intensity, growth in asset and wealth management, continued financing growth in our core Global Banking and Markets business, which you\u2019ve seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate profitably, which we believe we can do. We believe they are good businesses at scale, but they are in a different stage of the development. Those things should make the business more resilient, and that\u2019s not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at Investor Day. What I think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we\u2019re making in other things. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning and thank you. I guess maybe, David, just sticking to that, as you make the asset management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the ROTE target you put out last year? Is that still achievable within the 3-year time frame that you had laid out or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and, in a world, where consumer is being deemphasized? David Solomon : I think, candidly, that it depends on the environment. An environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we will push it out. If that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the firm, in addition to the work we\u2019re doing on the expense side that we\u2019ve gotten focused on, will show a very, very different picture. I\u2019m not going to guess on how that will play out. But again, I\u2019d amplify that I don\u2019t think what we saw in 2022 was normal. And certainly, if you go back and look at 15 years of history, it wasn\u2019t. Ebrahim Poonawala : Okay. And I guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in asset management, wealth management, significant asset price dislocations. Does that create some M&A opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those businesses? Or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic? David Solomon : I think at the moment, we\u2019re extremely focused on in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here, I do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset and wealth management. But certainly, this year, we\u2019re focused on the execution. We made an acquisition in asset management last year. We want to integrate NNIP. We want to move forward with that. So I think this year, we will be focused on execution. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So David and Denis, I wanted to start off with a question just on the provision outlook. Admittedly, the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated. And I was hoping you could just speak to, how much of it was growth math related versus deterioration in the macro? And given some of the planned actions you\u2019re going to take for that business, how should we think about like a normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward? Denis Coleman : Good morning, thank you for that So let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter. So order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%. Net charge-offs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. I think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter, and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023 is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, GreenSky. And so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. So that\u2019s something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year. Steven Chubak : Got it. And maybe just for a follow-up on capital. As it relates to the discussion tied to Glenn\u2019s question, I was hoping you could speak to how you\u2019re scenario planning for Basel IV, Basel III end game. I recognize we don\u2019t have a proposal yet, but certainly, it has significant implications for future returns you can generate. You\u2019re running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment. But just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses? What planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain? Denis Coleman : Sure. Fair question on everybody\u2019s mind. As you note, we don\u2019t yet have the details. But we give it a lot of thought. We\u2019ve taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we will be in a position to respond quickly to that. We do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. You can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our financial resources that we were able to maneuver them very, very quickly to build capital and change our RWA footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. So we\u2019re standing by for more detail on the rule, but confident that when we get it, we will be able to manage accordingly. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning, Betsy. Denis Coleman : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One follow-up on the consumer business, I heard you on the markets pull back, you\u2019re going to see originating there. Does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration and the partner card GreenSky, those pieces that you are keeping or is this market pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the ISG business? Denis Coleman : Sure. Betsy, it\u2019s Denis. I\u2019ll start with that. So as we indicated, we\u2019re going to cease the originations in under Marcus lending. And then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives. That should free up a bunch of financial resources. We\u2019re continued within the overall asset and wealth management segment where the deposit business is resident within the private banking and lending line. That remains a strategic priority for the firm, and we\u2019ve experienced very good growth there. That business is achieving more and more scale. So that will remain an ongoing focus. I think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we will continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. And within the Platform Solutions business, we\u2019re now down to three different businesses : transaction banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, GreenSky. And our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter. I know you had the action of the headcount reduction. Is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because, obviously, it\u2019s not ongoing? Or does that hit 1Q? Maybe you could speak to how we should think about that? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have one. Dave, I think it\u2019s your birthday today, right? You announced that a few years ago. David Solomon : It is my birthday, and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be on this call with you. But thank you. Thank you for that. Mike Mayo : Well, since it\u2019s your birthday, do you want the positive question or the negative question first. David Solomon : You want \u2013 I\u2019m happy to take any question. Any question that you have, Mike. You know that. We\u2019re happy to take questions both positive and tough. I mean it wasn\u2019t a great quarter. So I don\u2019t expect all the questions to be easy. Mike Mayo : Well, I mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg, I mean we will get more at the Investor Day. And just a comment, I hope you give us more data. Here we have three new sectors, and you only gave us the prior four quarters and the prior 2 years without much detail. So I hope you give us more ahead. But the question is, you present the firm differently, but will the firm actually be run differently other than the more narrow focus on consumer? David Solomon : Yes. And so I appreciate that. And to \u2013 two comments. First, just on the transparency and information comment, I think this management team, Mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of Goldman Sachs, and we remain focused on that. If you have certain feedback on things you\u2019d like to see, etcetera, we really welcome that, and Carey will reach out to you, and we will take that feedback. But we\u2019re focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we\u2019re doing. Second, on the evolution and the move to this, what I\u2019d say, and this has been something that\u2019s been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally. And that candidly is a difference than the way Goldman Sachs has been during my tenure at the firm. In terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we\u2019ve been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. I highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our Investor Day. It\u2019s long forgotten. But when we did our Investor Day, back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the ROE of the markets business above 10%. That was a big question on the minds of investors. And we look now at our combined banking and markets business, this business, we think, is a leader. It outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. We also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our financing business there, and we\u2019re very, very focused on that. In asset and wealth management, we\u2019ve worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. And as we\u2019ve said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. And we\u2019re on a journey. Would I like it to be further along? Yes. If it was further along, there would have been less volatility, particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter. But we continue \u2013 that\u2019s something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. The change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer business, I think, is a change. We continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. We think our partnership with Apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time. We think GreenSky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other businesses. They are small in the overall scale of Goldman Sachs, but we think there are benefits to that for the firm. We will communicate more as we move forward around that, but we\u2019re making progress and we will continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability. So that\u2019s a high-level response. I don\u2019t know if there is something else you want me to drill into, but that\u2019s a high-level response. Mike Mayo : Yes, the follow-up is more specific. I mean, look, you said it\u2019s a disappointing quarter. Your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efficiency ratios go the other direction. So I mean, I think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the benefits of what you might get on the expense side, okay, you\u2019re scaling back consumer as I asked you last quarter, you said you were losing money so maybe you lose less money. The headcount reduction should allow you to save money. So can you ballpark the benefits to expenses from the moves in consumer and the headcount reductions? And along those lines now that you\u2019ve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own firm\u2019s target buyback so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023? Denis Coleman : Sure, Mike, let me take that. So unpacking a couple components. So we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year, approximately 3,200 employees left the firm. The run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the benefit in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. Beyond that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. We\u2019re setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efficient levels of non-compensation spend. The narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. There are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of that. The focus is now narrow. And then finally, as you identify, we have more flexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for Mike. And just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter, just given how elevated the expenses were. So I guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inflexibility, revenues down 20% for the full year. And I understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was \u2013 it was a remarkable year. Some of it even identified or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn\u2019t be expected to repeat. So the \u2013 was the discipline fully there? Are you doing enough on comp? You have reiterated the focus on efficiency, but the results here in \u2013 I get it, nobody is buying Goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year. Denis Coleman : So Brennan, a couple of questions. As for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that\u2019s the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. So that\u2019s what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. As it relates to compensation expense, variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter, I guess I would point out a couple of things. One, the overall comp and benefit expense were down 15%. We had grown headcount by 10% additionally. And when you \u2013 that\u2019s over $2.5 billion of less compensation and benefit expense, so it\u2019s a meaningful number. And if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inflation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our firm on behalf of our clients. And we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. But ultimately, it\u2019s a balance. And we have excellent people. We depend on them to deliver for clients. The market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we\u2019re in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. Certainly, we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Alright. Thanks for that color, Denis. I appreciate that. This one might end up being moved, but I just don\u2019t want to confirm it. I have spend some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of J-curve expectation and whatnot, but it seems as though exiting Marcus and the tone down. Should we not even be thinking about a J-curve for the consumer business? Is that not a consideration here any longer because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even ex-provision has been a lot longer than expected. So, should we just forget about that chart given the pivot, or does that still remain part of the consideration? Denis Coleman : So, a couple of things I would point out. As people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the Platform Solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. So, we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to drive a lot of benefit at scale. But as we have discussed and you will observe, we also continue to build our provisions as we scale some of those activities. And so our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate profitability. And we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at Investor Day. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning David and Denis and happy birthday, David. David Solomon : Thank you. Devin Ryan : I guess just first one to zero in on transaction banking here in platforms. $325 million for transaction banking and other in 2022 is up 50% year-over-year. So, you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a couple of years ago, but still obviously immaterial. So, I just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is going in that part of the business. Can this get to a multi-billion dollar business just doing kind of what it\u2019s already doing? I know you just launched in Europe there, really just trying to think about kind of the execution roadmap for that part of the business. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks for that question. Now, we are very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it\u2019s a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it. We have our tech platform up and running. We continue to grow our clients on the platform. They unanimously continued to give us the feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of. And we have taken that business, as you say, from its inception to larger scale. We think there is a lot of potential for that business on the forward. And we are very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mentioned, our international expansion continues. We have opened in our fifth country. We now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. There are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global reach. And we continue to see very, very good opportunities for this business. Devin Ryan : Okay. Great. Thanks. A follow-up here just on the market\u2019s financing opportunity. So, that\u2019s already obviously been a nice part of the story for Goldman. What do you need to do to grow financing further? Is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling, or are there specific things you could point to that could drive kind of another step function there? And then just kind of more near-term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter. Has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetite to maybe a bit better today than through most of the fourth quarter? Denis Coleman : Yes. A couple of comments I would make. So, I think as it relates to the FICC financing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. The progress that we have made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now, our clients continue to come to us. And given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental financing activities in the FICC business. On the equity side of the equation, obviously, asset markets moved around quite severely, particularly in the end of the year, which drives prime brokerage balances. But as you know, we are also working very hard to reduce our financial resource footprint, particularly our G-SIB level. That brought with it significant RWA reductions. And it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter. I think as we turn the page on a New Year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities, and we have less constraints given that we have now achieved the 3% G-SIB target. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to expand upon the new Slide 7. And as you look at the different buckets and asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fund raises and closings? And I was hoping you could maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you have typically seen for second or third funds from the previous one to give us a sense of the momentum you are seeing in that business? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, we always have a very, very broad portfolio of funds. And we have been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it\u2019s one of the contributors to our position as the number five largest active asset management firm in the world. And across the portfolio of different funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. Our GS Capital Partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. We have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. And we continued to diversify and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. So, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many different types of investors, many of which are very, very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer. Dan Fannon : Okay. And then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the FICC and trading backdrop. It sounds like you are through kind of the optimization of RWAs, but maybe can you talk about where you see on the broader intermediation side, the backdrop, maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, we continue to focus on market share. Market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year, it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. So, that remains a very, very core focus of the firm. We continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. One of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. The last year, given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. Meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. Certainly, if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there is a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we have made in the client franchise. So, I can\u2019t predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. Certainly, some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022. But it\u2019s quite possible that certain activities that were softer in \u201822 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. You mentioned continued interest in asset and wealth management deals, kind of over time. It sounds more like bolt-on, but I guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out, not necessarily this year, but just in the next couple of years. I mean to-date, you have \u2013 what I would characterize, I think most people had characterized, you have piece-mailed some deals. You have done some organic expansion and mixed results in different areas. But just thoughts on maybe more openness to something transformational down the road. David Solomon : I think we have been asked this question. I appreciate the question. We have been asked it a bunch over time. I think in certain businesses like asset and wealth management, there are significant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. We have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that we have stood up all the businesses inside Goldman Sachs. And so that scale is real. And there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. And certainly, there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more significant. I would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. There are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. Certainly, over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we are in a different environment where well, that will normalize. But we are always open to things that we think can strengthen Goldman Sachs, but also as somebody that\u2019s been an M&A banker for a significant part of my career, I know the barter do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very, very high. So, I would say we are always open. But at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That was clear. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. David, in your opening comments, you gave us your three priorities of growing management fees in the Asset & Wealth Management business, maximizing the wallet share and growing financing activities in global banking and markets and then scaling the platform. In your \u2013 in the number two, maximizing the wallet share, can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share, both in investment banking and markets? And how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years? David Solomon : Yes. So, we \u2013 you can take a look at our performance in these businesses. And you can see that the performance is quite strong. A couple of things I will point to even in this quarter\u2019s performance. You can look at our relative M&A revenue performance. You can look at our relative FICC performance and even our equities performance in what\u2019s been a tough quarter, the relatives look pretty good. We set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. We had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. We had always thought about them in our investment banking business. And we really \u2013 we brought that ethos into the markets business. And I know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our FICC and equities businesses. And we are top three with only 44 of them. We are now top three with 77 of those top 100. And now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay, top three, but why aren\u2019t we wanted to, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we think there is more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing and ticking equities on that number one and number two position. In banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. That footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there has been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity, but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3-year or a 5-year view looking forward. So, again, there is a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we are investing in. The core of the firm is very strong. Those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. And I don\u2019t think there is any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we will continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the consumer business, you have been very clear, obviously, on how you are positioning this going forward. I may have missed this, so I apologize. But what went wrong? When you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, I know Marcus deposits has been around longer than that. But when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong? David Solomon : Well, I think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. I think we executed well on some things that we didn\u2019t execute on others. But the simple thing that I would phrase, Gerard, and I think it\u2019s a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly. And of course, in the environment that we are in, it\u2019s hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. We obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. And I think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. One of the big changes that affect the pace of the ability to do this and it\u2019s different in scaling things like this is CECL is a big change. CECL changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. So, we have had to adjust to that. The regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. But I think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was affecting our execution. I think we probably, in some places, haven\u2019t had all the talent that we have needed to execute the way we have wanted. We are making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the three core things that we are going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm. I think we have got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. And so that\u2019s what we are doing. And I \u2013 the takeaway I would like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. We are not married to things. We are willing to change. I think when I go back to our 2020 Investor Day, and I look at what we laid out during that period of time, we have accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we have laid out. That doesn\u2019t mean there is not more work to do. But you know what, we didn\u2019t execute perfectly on some. So, we have taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. And that\u2019s kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of Goldman Sachs that I want to amplify. We are always willing to make changes. We are always going to be focused on shareholders. And even though everything has not gone perfectly, again, I would point to our 40% book value growth since our Investor Day, and I map that out. Our book value per share growth, I believe it\u2019s more than double the next nearest competitor. And so we are going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long-term. I think we are good at nimbly making adjustments, and we will always be very clear to have when we get things right or we get things wrong. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking, I appreciate Denis\u2019 comments, we have seen a big increase in debt issuance, so some improving liquidity in the debt markets at least. Is that, in your mind, a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs? And just generally, how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking? Thanks. David Solomon : Yes. Sure. I think that \u2013 I think one of the things we are dealing with and it\u2019s over-amplified in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. The second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. They were way inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of, I would call, on the spectrum of activity, excess activity, pulled a lot of activity forward. And then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. It\u2019s the first year in over 50 years that both fixed income and equity markets were down. We had the S&P down 20%, the NASDAQ down 30%. You had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. And when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. My historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. And so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly, for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. But if it\u2019s at $70 for four quarters or five quarters, six quarters, then it\u2019s $70. And suddenly, when you look ahead and you think about either an M&A transaction or financing, you have more realism about the reset of values. So, I think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. I think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but I think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. That would obviously be where it would come first. But my expectations would be in the back half of \u201823 meaningfully better. And also, it\u2019s interesting, and I will be heading to Dallas tonight with others, but I was watching some of the commentary, the macro commentary. People are softening their view of 2023. And I would say it\u2019s getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. And that too, will affect capital markets opportunity because it\u2019s really tied to confidence. So, I think we are going through that. I don\u2019t think anything has fundamentally changed. I think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. But you shouldn\u2019t look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn\u2019t look at 2021 is normal. They normalized somewhere in the middle. Jim Mitchell : Right. And maybe just a follow-up on the reserve and provisioning. That\u2019s obviously been a big drag in profitability as you grow the platform business. But as you shrink Marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow. I know GreenSky is growing on balance sheet, but the rest of the business is that slow? Do we start to see provisioning slow and given how high your reserve levels already are? Just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. And so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. That being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. So, that\u2019s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. You notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. That\u2019s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. And so we have made some adjustments, which reflect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : Since there are no more questions, we would like to thank everyone for joining the call. And certainly, if additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon and seeing many of you at our Investor Day on February 28th. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 18, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer, Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. We produced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79 and an ROE of 11.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The first quarter was certainly volatile, particularly for the banking sector. After a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year, in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the United States. Stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the financial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order. These stresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of Switzerland's two largest financial institutions. It's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves during the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen two-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday. One was in September 2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year. Monday, March 13th was the biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years. As we sit here today, it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering confidence and stabilizing market sentiment. The events of the first quarter acted as another real-life stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest financial institutions. The G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the financial system. We joined a consortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term deposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of confidence in and commitment to the U.S. banking sector. As for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history, we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous processes and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to react quickly and effectively when they do occur. While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly, our risk management culture, strong liquidity, and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients. Given this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a strong quarter, as we helped clients with their intermediation and financing needs. Underwriting activity, however, remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry-leading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and diversified set of businesses. Management fees across Asset & Wealth Management grew sequentially, but segment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments remained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do. In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards profitability. We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses. In the first quarter, we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reflected in our AWM segment, it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you through the financial impact of that momentarily. Additionally, we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky. We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with first quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities however, we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. We will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments. As I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit. This is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely. Businesses and consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward trajectory is still unclear, we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the firm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further. Overall, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated, we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence. And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February, we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the first quarter, which generated an industry-leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were down 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be below recent averages and were lower year-over-year. Despite the difficult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for completed M&A and high-yield debt underwriting. We also ranked second for equity and equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter, primarily in Advisory, but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. We also expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen broadly, but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the first two weeks of the second quarter. FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter, down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than offset by significantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the first quarter of 2022. In FICC financing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record financing revenues of $1.3 billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year, given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year, driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions. The associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely offset by a reserve release of $440 million. Additionally, we benefited from NII and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was profitable for the quarter. Net revenues for equity investments were $119 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially offset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate. This quarter, we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE portfolio, which are reflected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues were $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million. Moving on to Page 6, total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inflows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide flows in the money market funds. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid given the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain confident in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion. On balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which $27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density, including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by 2024 year-end. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms. This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional offering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the firm. In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February, we're focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider. In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately 20% in the first quarter. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter was down 14% relative to the fourth quarter, driven by increased funding costs supporting training activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $171 million, including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates, which were only partially offset by roughly $245 million in consumer net charge-offs. Spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter-end, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversified by property type and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical LTVs of approximately 50%. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4 billion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter, but up versus last year. The majority of the year-over-year increase was driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to NNIP. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year, we expect a tax rate between 21% and 22%. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buffer. In the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over $2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million. While we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary. Though we find our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In conclusion, our first quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment. Our robust financial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients and helping them navigate this period of market disruption. Across our leading businesses in Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, we remain well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic priorities. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. Curious, you mentioned being optimistic about M&A in the back-half, particularly on the strategic side. I'm curious what and how you -- what you're seeing that gives you that confidence. Obviously it must be conversations. And then what about the sponsor community? Thanks. David Solomon : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. And so appreciate the question, and you're right. It has to do with dialogs and things that we can see. I'd say as we came into the new year, there's no questions dialogs have picked up. There's no question -- and I always talk about this when we talk about it broadly, confidence affects the ability for people to move forward to be active in the M&A market and certainly what's gone on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs. But when you think about big strategic activity, I think most big companies continue to operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies. And so those strategic dialogs are quite active. And if you actually look over the course of the last week or two, there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that. We're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come to fruition. I just think that's a steady part of the diet. The companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position. Now, with respect to financial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. I'm encouraged by the fact in the quarter, we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a financial sponsor could achieve and the financing price came to a -- came to meet. There was a good data point and a sell-down of a legacy deal in the market, but I would say the financial sponsor activity is still muted and there is more upside as the reset on both value and financing cost continues. I think we're going to get there. I'd expect more in the second half of the year unless there was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset. We've now kind of gone through five quarters of reset. And so generally speaking, historically, you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters. So I would just expect more of a base level of activity from what's been very, very muted. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. And building on that, your comment about companies wanting to build on their strategic position, maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction banking platform because it's still growing. I'm just curious on the March events that we saw, did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the direction of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits? And did you notice any -- was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the March crisis? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Glenn, it's Denis. Thanks for the question. I'd say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very, very strong. I think what we were able to observe in the first quarter, I highlighted in my script and it's something that we're focused on strategically, is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter, which is a similar amount to all of last year. And we're very, very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients, offer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value. I think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter, they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on a quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, David, you referred to the hyper volatility in the rates market, but would appreciate if you can address just fixed-income trading, what happened there this quarter. Clearly there was some lagged performance versus peers. To the extent you can, just give us a flavor of what happened and your expectations around how things evolve from here, how are clients' macro funds holding up in face of this volatility. David Solomon : Yes. So I appreciate the question. I mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what I'd highlight is, I think we had a very solid quarter in FICC. We had nearly a $4 billion quarter. And just to put that in perspective, I think that's a top-decile quarter for that. I think we've had -- I think it was the eighth best quarter on record. I think we've got 96 quarters. So it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid FICC quarter. It was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter, and I think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. Now, some of the noise that I see just from the early morning release, our FICC business was down versus the first quarter of last year by 17%, but in the first quarter of last year, we had significant outperformance. If I remember correctly, our FICC revenues in the first quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of flat or down. And you can go look at that from a base perspective. We had much more significant outperformance in the first quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. So if you remember back in the first quarter of 2022, the war with Ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. And so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, I think FICC performance in the quarter was strong. We were there to serve our clients. And by any standards, it was a good quarter. I think given the environment that we're operating in, I would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. It's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're finding our clients active at the moment. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thanks for that. And then just separately, I guess, a big focus post Investor Day was picking up pace on asset sales. How does the environment over the last month influence that? Equity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the financials. So given the sense of just asset sale pace of that, how you're thinking about that and any change today versus Investor Day and how does that translate into pace of buybacks maybe in the back half of the year? David Solomon : Yes. So we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter. Then it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months. We feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time. There are a lot of positions. There's no question when there are market headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower, but we're on pace with what we're trying to do and are committed to it. And obviously, we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments out, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Denis. Just to follow up on the question on the Markets business, March did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients, particularly saw hedge fund closures, we are hearing of deleveraging. So how does that inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market share, particularly given, I guess, Goldman's exposure to the hedge fund community? David Solomon : So I appreciate that question. We're obviously very focused on share and our share gains. We do participate with the hedge fund community, but when you look at our big competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too. We also are very significant with the broad institutional community. As I said just in the previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot going on. We're very focused on our market share. As we said in our Investor Day, we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets business. We continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to serve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be active. Christian Bolu : Great. Thank you. And then maybe a question on capital return. Can you just clarify why you are slowing buybacks? Your capital ratio is seen very healthy to your point that the stock is attractive at this level. So not sure that I get it. And then any comments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here? There's been a lot of stress in the wealth management space, which is a space I know you guys are interested in. So curious here, if you're conserving capital to go on the offense. Denis Coleman : Sure. Christian, it's Denis. Thank you for the question around capital. And obviously, in this case, appreciating the starting point in Q1, where we significantly increased the amount of buyback activity in Q1. We remain very committed to return of capital to shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the overall capital return profile, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients. And there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. And so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor that over the course of the quarter. As you say, we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start off with a question on Platform Solutions. The business saw a step up in expense. I just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the trajectory for expenses in the segment. And similarly, for provision going forward, just following this quarter's significant reserve release, we know you had accrued reserves pretty conservatively for that segment, but the top line momentum's good. It would just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the expense as well as the credit trajectory from here. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks. In terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, I think we have to step back. Our number one focus is driving towards profitability. We also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efficiency ratio. That's certainly over the course of a period of time. Maybe not every given quarter, but we remain committed to what we outlined. As you say, we've seen good top line performance of the business. And on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for some period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. And GreenSky is actually performing better than we had modeled. And so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment. As we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform. We now have a reserve level of roughly 13% in the consumer space. So that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity. Steven Chubak : That's great, Denis. And just for my follow-up on expense and maybe more like a ticky tack modeling question, the expenses were a bit higher than expectations, but I recall you noted at Investor Day the need to absorb some severance charges. You also had some pretty outsized impairments related to CIE portfolio. Was hoping you can maybe help us quantify the level of one-timers in the expense base this quarter just as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longer-term efficiency targets. Denis Coleman : Thank you. Thank you very much. So let me take that in pieces. In terms of -- on the compensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the first quarter are included within our overall comp accrual, which is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. That's embedded inside of that number. In terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but did include, as you know, $355 million of CIE impairments. And so we thought it was important to call that out. And that also explains a bunch of the year-over-year delta between Q1 '22 and Q1 '23. That together with full quarter impact of NNIP helps explain the delta in that line for the first quarter of this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : So just a couple of quick questions here. One, on the consumer repositioning that you talked about today with the Marcus loan sales and with your comments around GreenSky, would you say that as those are done and dusted, that would be it for the consumer repositioning? David Solomon : I think, Betsy, what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. We continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. I do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible. As I just highlighted, we don't think we're necessarily the best owner of GreenSky. So we're taking action on that, and then we'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to profitability. Betsy Graseck : And so there's some nice capital release that comes from that. How should we anticipate you're going to be utilizing that as we look forward here? Denis Coleman : So as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us incremental flexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the franchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy. How much in the Marcus loans, I think there were $4.5 billion at year-end, did you sell? And what do you intend to do with the rest? Denis Coleman : So we sold about $1 billion of the Marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time. Mike Mayo : And so the marks that you took on these loans, what -- on what -- how much of those marks were in the $4.5 billion? Was it only a subset or the entire portfolio? Denis Coleman : So we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the balance to market. And you'll see that reflected in the $470 million number moving through net revenues. And our reserve release was $440 million. If you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter, we generated incremental NII, and we had other net paydowns. So for the whole quarter, we generated revenues north of $150 million and it was profitable for the quarter. As we move forward into the second quarter, we'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to follow up first on a question that Glenn asked about the transactional banking. In the past, in conversations, I believe that you've indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks there. So I want to confirm that that's the case. And then given some of the stress that we've seen and concerns around some of those providers, how are you adjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem to have shown here in the first quarter? And if we see that continued stress, would you pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities? David Solomon : Yes. So appreciate the question, Brennan. The -- we think in transaction banking, we have a very good platform, a very good product. And the feedback that we're getting from clients about the product offering, how it works, what it allows corporate treasuries and CFOs to do is very positive. It's obviously attractive for us to take deposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform. And so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding clients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in a way that grows that platform. We are seeing positive results, but this takes time. These are long-cycle decisions. They're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. As Denis highlighted, we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. I do think, given the size and the strength of Goldman Sachs, as a G-SIB and the way we're positioned, we're well positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product offering. So we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it. And then for my follow-up, you all just announced this morning the new deposit arrangement with Apple. And the yield on that is pretty close to Marcus, a little above. How should we think about the economics of that Apple relationship and the deposits specifically? And then how do you manage potential risk for cannibalization with your own Marcus offering? Thanks. David Solomon : So thank you for the question. So obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel. It's the opportunity for somebody that's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. We've obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there is any cannibalization. But this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. And so this is small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully, but I think it's an interesting opportunity for the firm. Operator : We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Great. Good morning, David, Denis. I want to just touch on the equity financing strength in the quarter. I know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity, but also appreciate this is an area of focus for the firm bigger picture. So just love to think about kind of where we're jumping off of into the second quarter and whether the first quarter benefited from the market stress and that maybe you do syncretic things that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of jumping off point, and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the year. Denis Coleman : Sure. I appreciate that question. I'll give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction. So our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint. And so as we came into the first quarter, we were able to re-expand the capacity, clients engaged with us. We saw an increase in balances, increase in client activities, increase in customer spreads. We've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come on to the platform and engage with us. And so I'd say that we're working sort of full speed ahead on that. We continue to be very, very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the Global Banking & Markets business. Devin Ryan : Okay. Thanks, Denis. Just a bigger picture follow-up here. So it feels like Goldman generally takes market share during periods of stress. And so we just went through a pretty extreme period of stress in banking system and maybe we're getting on the other side of it, but perhaps not. And so with Credit Suisse now forcing an acquisition and capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly, are there new areas of maybe opportunity for Goldman to take market share just in terms of where you're going to lean in with your balance sheet as you've done in the past? How should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you can maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over the last month or so? David Solomon : Well, I think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. You can see the performance this quarter. I certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for investment banking, traditional capital markets, IPOs, M&A activity. But with a 16.7% ROE in our banking and markets segment, I think it's performing well. We have the breadth, the footprint, the global franchise, I think, to continue to strengthen our share. And as I commented a little bit earlier, we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure that we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well. I do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities. I think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in Europe. We see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large Swiss institutions with a consolidation. We're certainly seeing opportunities in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have. And so that's an area for share that we're focused on. So we continue to look across both Global Banking & Markets and also Asset & Wealth Management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the third-party fundraising. You had another great quarter, but certainly highlighted that a bit slow this year, and I guess that's not surprising given the environment. But could you talk kind of longer term, as you think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up? And also, the cycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year that might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go through that cycle? Denis Coleman : So thanks a lot for the question. Obviously, this remains a big area of strategic focus for us. With $14 billion raised in the first quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel very good about that. We indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year, but we do have about 20 offerings in market on diversified basis across asset classes where we're actively looking to raise funds. I think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets. Different strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of offering, I think, is proving to be beneficial. So even though we indicated it may slow later in this year, strong conviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given what we see across our platform. David Solomon : And I'd just say, Dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for 2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the offering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform. And so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuff, but there is a lot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. And then just a follow-up, Denis, on the expense side. The $1 billion of savings from realization of programs that you highlighted at Investor Day, what was realized in the first quarter? Or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those savings as we think about the range of this year? Denis Coleman : So at Investor Day, we outlined that over the course of the year, we'd have run rate payroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efficiency, about $400 million, and we see about half of that reflected in this year and the balance thereafter. I'd say we're on target for those initiatives and those efficiencies. And we continue to look at it, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efficiency across our platform. One area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional fees. We continue to grind that down. And if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're making good progress against most of the line items. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David Solomon : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : David, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion by the end of '24. In those market conditions, is it more the IPO and ECM markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area? Or is it just general market levels and the activity we're seeing? David Solomon : Well, I appreciate the question, Gerard. And I think all these things contribute. Financing availability contributes on certain assets; IPO market can contribute on certain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. I want to put the comments in perspective because I think that appropriately, we want to make sure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are tough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our Investor Day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments. We continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. We're confident that we're going to execute on that target. So I think the way to think about this is we laid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving along on that target. I wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter basis, things can slow down. I wouldn't overstate that, but I want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difficult, that could potentially slow us down. But we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to execute on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a bit and here in the second quarter, you're very well capitalized. If market conditions -- I should ask, I guess, how important is it that the financial markets need to stabilize for you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying back the stock? Denis Coleman : Thanks for the question. Look, I think it gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment. Given some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful of that. We want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so we're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment. David Solomon : Yes. I'd also -- I also just want to highlight, when we spoke at Investor Day, we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. That is still in place. Quarter-to-quarter may vary, but that is still in place. And so I just want that also kept in perspective too. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I think you hinted at improved dialog levels in underwriting to start the quarter. So can you just give a little more color what you're seeing in the market and maybe how you see the ECM and DCM environment evolving, assuming we don't have another major step back in the macro? David Solomon : Yes. I think there have been some greenshoots. There were certainly some greenshoots in February. Levels are still muted. There are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some significant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. But I still think we're below trend level. As I said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. Generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. But when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. We're kind of five quarters in. And so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile March, and I'd say things are still slow, but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. And we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year. James Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on FICC financing, I know that's been a focus of growth as well outside of -- equities saw a pretty strong improvement in spreads and volume, but it doesn't look like we saw that in FICC. Anything to think about on the FICC side, on the financing space and how you see that going forward? Denis Coleman : Sure. Still very, very committed to the FICC financing business, which, as we indicated, was up slightly year-over-year. There continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients. I think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go-to calls for the provision of financing across the FICC space. So that, combined with the equity financing, remain real priorities for our Global Banking & Markets business. We feel good about it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Jeremy Sigee : Thank you. Good morning. Could I get you to talk a bit more about the Credit Suisse opportunity in wealth management? You mentioned Europe, but could you also talk a bit about Asia and Latin America? Are those regions where you as a firm have sufficient strength in wealth management to take more share from the Swiss banks since they are disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you? David Solomon : On the second part of the question, I think when you look at Latin America, it's more marginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are opportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world. We also have very, very strong Latin American presence that comes into our presence in Florida, obviously, where our private wealth business is focused on Latin America. So there is opportunity there. We continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in Asia. We haven't been as focused on growth and investment in Asia as we have been in Europe over the course of the last couple of years. We did launch a private wealth joint venture over in Asia over the course of the last couple of months with ICBC, which I think is a small and slow opportunity, but is an opportunity for us. I think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple providers. So whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversification of their footprint. And so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients. Jeremy Sigee : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. So my first question is about your focus on credit cards on the consumer side. Perhaps you can talk more specifically about what you see as your competitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in this point of the cycle. It's perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that credit card growth tends to be a reflection of individuals not being able to manage expenses in a high inflationary environment. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks. So as you know, we have our card platform business. We've been building that over the next -- over the last several years. We have partnership with General Motors, a partnership with Apple, and we've been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances. As you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down sequentially, just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe it's an overall piece of the firm that is diversifying. Andrew Lim : Great. Okay. I've got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in March and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well. So if we think about the SVB situation, obviously, they decided to sell a lot of their assets below market value, and in the process, crystallizing a lot of those losses. And I guess in retrospect, it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets with the Fed and avoid those mark-to-market losses. And I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to maybe why that didn't happen. It would have been obviously to afford a lot of the crisis confidence advice from that situation. David Solomon : I don't really have a -- I don't have a comment on that, Andrew. There are a variety of factors in the actions that they took. Ultimately, there was a bank run at SVB and that led to the situation we are. But I don't -- I'm not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that. Operator : Thank you. We'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. First, Goldman specific and then general. The Goldman specific is why now on the consumer repositioning, GreenSky sale and Marcus loans? And then a more general question. To what degree did Silicon Valley impact the capital markets and the advisory appetite out there? Thanks. David Solomon : Yes. Thanks, Mike. So first, why now, it's actually not why now. It's like -- it's why over the last 12 months is, as you know, we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on it. And it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it are not things that can be done instantaneously. So we've gone through a very, very thoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that. Again, I think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of Goldman Sachs. The Marcus loan portfolio was profitable but small, wasn't strategic. GreenSky, as we highlighted today, we think it's a good business, good platform, and actually, as we watch it perform, it's performing well. But given the way we've narrowed our focus, not strategic for us. And so we're simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders. On the second question, which is just what happened in March, how did it affect capital markets and M&A, I think it has a effect. It was a highly -- as I highlighted in my comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really, really outsized volatility, and as you and I discussed before, whenever you have that kind of volatility, it slows down capital markets activity. So I thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of February. I noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets are behaving reasonably well. I can't say that there won't be some other event that creates stress. There certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an example, but I do think when you have that kind of volatility, it slows down or it has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets. So yes, [technical difficulty] quarter. It was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole. Operator : We'll take a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Just one quick question, Denis, maybe. Around the Apple savings deposit, how do you intend to use the funds that come in? I appreciate early days in terms of the level of inflows that you may get on that product, but is that money just going to sit in cash earning Fed funds? Just trying to figure out what the NII revenue impact could be tied to those deposits. David Solomon : Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Ebrahim. So across the firm, we have multiple funding channels, multiple sources that we tap in our BAU activities. We have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day. We view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our relationship with Apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account. And we'll take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Carey Halio : Yes. Thank you all for calling. We appreciate the time and interest in the firm. And if you have any additional questions, certainly feel free to call me or the rest of the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference. Carey Halio : Thank you. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, [indiscernible] this information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Solomon. Let me pass the call to David. David Solomon : Thank you, Carey and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our results were impacted by several items related to businesses we are executing on a strategic transition and positioning the firm for the future. In particular, shifting our asset wealth management business to a less capital-intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition. All in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular, headwinds facing our specific mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk-off posture over the course of the quarter. CEOs around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions and slower growth. But we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our financial system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity. And we're seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already, particularly equity capital markets and M&A dialogue. There's no question, recent economic data in the U.S. indicates the Fed's efforts to fight inflation are showing progress and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory. However, the year unfolds, we stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and operating the firm more efficiently. Importantly, we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our Investor Day in February and we are in execution mode. We have 2 incredibly strong client franchises a world-class global banking and markets business, we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels and a scaled asset and wealth management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our Investor Day goals with growth and more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending. These businesses are supported by a number of things. First, a long track record of serving the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals, building relationships as a trusted adviser is core to what Goldman Sachs does. Next, the client-centric mindset. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our efforts to bring to bear the best of the firm's capabilities and holistically serve clients with our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. Client feedback continues to be highly encouraging and we see opportunities to make further gains. We also have a global, broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions a key differentiator of value to our clients around the world. We have exceptional people. They are differentiated and they work hard to make a difference for our clients. And lastly, this is all underpinned by a culture of collaboration and excellence. We are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business and multiyear progress, deploy our capital. We continue to execute on the $30 billion share repurchase program we announced in February and we recently announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have made it a priority to grow our dividend to a competitive rate. And since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our dividend from $0.80 to $2.75 per share per quarter. Given our ongoing strategic efforts to lower the firm's capital density and reduce earnings volatility, we are well positioned to grow it further. As I said, we are laser focused on executing on our strategy. This moment in the economic cycle creates meaningful headwinds for Goldman Sachs and our business mix. At the same time, we are making tough decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the firm. Given both these factors, that should come as no surprise that we're going to a period of lower results. I remain fully confident that we will deliver on our through-the-cycle targets of mid-teens returns on at significant value for shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $10.9 million [ph] and net earnings of $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.08. As David mentioned, we have provided additional detail this quarter on 3 items that impacted our results. These items are a gain in connection with our sale process for the market's unsecured loan portfolio as well as the business' operating results. Losses from our historical principal investments within Asset and Wealth Management and results related to GreenSky, including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms. In aggregate, for the second quarter, these 3 items impacted net earnings by $1.4 billion and reduced our EPS by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 4; Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Advisory revenues of $645 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid significantly lower industry completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $338 million as we saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets, although volumes continue to remain well below medium and long-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of 2022 as activity remains muted. Nonetheless, our client franchise remains very strong and we remain well positioned to support the needs of our clients. We ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and high-yield debt on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, primarily in advisory. Fixed net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter as clients remained in a risk-off posture, relative to an active prior year quarter, particularly in commodities, rates and currencies. Fixed financing revenues were $622 million. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-on-year. Equities financing revenues were a record $1.4 billion as we benefited from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances. This was largely offset by a decline in intermediation revenues, primarily in derivatives. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both second equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support further growth. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5; revenues of $3 billion were down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments. Management and other fees increased 5% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher assets under supervision. Private Banking and lending revenues were also a record at $874 million. We continue to see positive momentum in this business as we benefit from higher deposit balances and NII. Results were supported by a gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of substantially all of the remaining Marcus loans portfolio. Equity investments generated losses of $403 million. More specifically, we had roughly $305 million of net losses in our private portfolio, primarily due to markdowns on investments in office-related commercial real estate and approximately $100 million of net losses in our public portfolio, largely driven by a loss related to a historical principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter. Importantly, we have now reduced the public portfolio to approximately $1 billion, down from more than $4.5 billion in 2021. Debt investments revenues were $197 million, with the year-over-year decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments. This quarter, we also experienced approximately $485 million of impairments on our real estate-related CIE portfolio which are reflected in operating expenses. In aggregate, the results from Marcus loans and the losses from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately 15 percentage points for the first half of the year. Now moving to Page 6; total firm with assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $30 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows and representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning now to Page 7 on alternatives; alternative assets on supervision totaled $267 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $521 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $11 billion for the quarter and $25 billion for the first half of the year. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now over $200 billion and remains very well positioned to achieve our 2024 target of $225 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $53 billion, of which $24 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we reduced this portfolio by $3.6 billion which included sales of a number of CRE-related investments, bringing year-to-date reductions to approximately $6 billion and putting us well on pace to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8; revenues were $659 million, driven by growth in loan balances and consumer platforms. As noted earlier, we took a $504 million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer platforms this quarter in connection our exploration of a potential sale of the GreenSky business. We will continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment and should we decide to sell the business, we will also make a determination regarding moving Greensky to held for sale, similar to the action we took last quarter with respect to our markets unsecured loan portfolio. We will share further updates as appropriate. Additionally, you'll recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we said that we expected to reduce the efficiency ratio in Platform Solutions below 100% by the end of this year and we are making progress. Absent the impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms, the efficiency ratio for the segment year-to-date would have been better than our stated goal. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, unchanged versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $615 million. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net charge-offs in our lending portfolio within consumer platforms. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments and a reserve build were partially offset by releases due to lower balances. Moving on to Page 10; we've added a new slide this quarter, providing additional detail on our CRE exposure. Starting with the left side of the page, CRE loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book, roughly 15%. And we are well diversified by property type with only 1% in the office category. Moving to the right side of the page, you can see additional detail on our CRE-related on-balance sheet alternative investments. We conducted a comprehensive asset-by-asset review of this portfolio this quarter and we have incorporated the feedback from our sell-down process. Office-related exposure represents approximately 2% of the aggregate portfolio and equity securities loans and debt securities and approximately 15% of the CIE investments in other category net of financings. Overall, the CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Furthermore, 50% of these investments are historical principal investments that we intend to exit over the medium term. We continue to remain highly focused on the overall risk management of this portfolio. Turning to expenses on Page 11; total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 34% which includes approximately $260 million of year-to-date state severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated this year and we have now largely reached this organ with line of sight to surpass it. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion. The increase in our non-compensation expense was entirely driven by the CIE and goodwill impairments I discussed previously. Absent these items, non-comp expense is down for the second consecutive quarter, even in the face of inflationary headwinds. Our effective tax rate for the first half of '20 was an increase in taxes on non-U.S. earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of roughly 22%. Next, capital on Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach which is 190 basis points over our new 13% requirement that will become applicable in October. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain confident that our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our SEB over time. The 80 basis point reduction in our SEB will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to support our client franchise. In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $750 million and common stock dividends of $864 million. Our Board has also approved a 10% increase in our dividend, to $2.75 per share beginning in the third quarter. This increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield, complemented by our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program where we intend to step up the level of buybacks going forward. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect a challenging backdrop as well as our ongoing execution of several strategic actions. These initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return profile. We remain confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I want to talk about how we build towards that that the medium-term ROE target. So obviously, this was -- this quarter was depressed by the write-downs. Let's start with a 9-ish starting point. We know capital markets activity will be better in normal time. So I know we're a lot closer than it looks right now. If you look at Page 7, where you spelled out the $3.6 billion of historical Principal Investments that declined in the quarter. Or if you want to do it year-to-date either way. My question related to that reducing capital intensity is in a good way, it didn't look like there was a big gain or loss related to those exits. A) Is that right? And B) how much capital that free up because I'm just trying to build towards that ultimate goal. Denis Coleman : So Glenn, thank you for the question. And I think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns, there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at Investor Day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efficiency. The capital efficiency has been a project that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had particular increases in those reductions over both the first and second quarter. As you know, about HPI down $6 billion. And as we -- if we ultimately reach our target, we expect the total AE reduction to be approximately $9 billion. David Solomon : Yes. I just -- Glenn, I just want to add 2 things, just looking at that because Denise focused on the AE and the continued journey. The one thing you didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that, there are some where you're reduce where -- it might be a public physician. So we mark those public positions that market that night and you sell that position at a discount. So there could be a slight loss. There are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe it's worth as you sell and you get a gain. But I wouldn't say there's anything material that I'd call out in the context of that process. But the important thing about the journey that I'd like to emphasize is we laid out clear in Investor Day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these 2 big businesses. Clearly, at this point in time, given the lack of investment banking activity, our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. We don't believe that's constant. We believe that, that global markets and banking business can deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than 2/3 of the firm. In addition, Mark Nachmann laid out at our Investor Day, a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to 25%. At that point, that is a mid-teens return business. And as we continue to narrow the drag which we're making progress on in the platforms and I believe we'll narrow that to 0 and move past that, you've got these 2 businesses that are the firm that will be mid-teens through the cycle. So that's the way I'd think about it. But obviously, you need a better environment in this environment to see that. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that. And maybe 1 just big picture. Think a lot of banks that -- investment banks that have reported over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity returning. And I think in typical Goldman fashion, you all have been I think, appropriately conservative over the last couple of quarters. So maybe I'll just get a mark-to-market on what green shoots you may or may not be seeing. You mentioned your advisory pipeline was up; just like kind of contextualize that, that would be great. David Solomon : Sure. I'd say on the following. It definitely feels better over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks than it felt earlier in the year. And I've talked in the past on this call and other times when I've talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes 5 or 6 quarters to get that reset. It's not surprising that we're kind of at 6 quarters now and you're starting to see more activity. So it's definitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity. That definitely feels better. There's more M&A dialogue I can't tell you exactly what the journey is. But when I go back and I look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity, they tend to last for a year or so and then they start to improve. And so I think we're starting to see that here. It definitely feels better. I think the inflation data has been better. The client sentiment is better and now we'll have to watch and see that journey. But I know this activity level of 10-year loans and investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a forward basis. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just the first question, when we think about potential for obviously pick up in the back half, David, as you just mentioned but give us a sense of rightsizing the business, given the slowdown that we've seen over the last year or so, -- are we there headcount-wise, infrastructure-wise, where you want it to be on the expense base and as we anchor back to the efficiency target around 60%. Just give us a sense of how you think we get there and where the where Gold minister in terms of just rightsizing the expense base? David Solomon : Yes. So I think we've made -- I'll make a couple of comments and Dennis will probably add on with some more granular detail. But I think we've made progress. We set out some targets at the beginning of the year. As you heard in Dennis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished in line of sight for more. You've seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row. We've been very focused on that. And there's been real work done there because there's certainly inflationary pressure on a bunch of the line items that are noncomp expenses. I think that with hindsight, I'm very glad that we were early in January is starting to work on the headcount sizing. We took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are. I'd remind everybody. And we've said this before that we are resuming our regular performance-based process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and started again next year when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review but we have no other specific plans on the headcount now. We'll watch the trajectory of revenues in the environment as we go forward. We'll always make adjustments if something changes. But as we just said, we think we're operating an extraordinarily low activities of investment banking. We're not going to erode that franchise. That is a key franchise of the firm. So this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover. We obviously are focused on a bunch of efficiency uplift in processes and operations. We have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that. So we think that over time, that's or early '24 thing but we think over time, that's something else that will benefit the trajectory. Dennis, do you have some specific extent? Denis Coleman : I mean just to add for you. So end of the second quarter, we ended -- headcount was 44,600 down about 2% on the quarter, about 8% year-to-date. I think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter. But as David said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year, positioning the firm reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just maybe a quick follow-up. I think if I heard you correctly, you mentioned goal to maybe step up a pace of buybacks in the back half. Just if you could maybe put some numbers around that, what level of buybacks we should expect? And how big a deal is the Fed Basel NPR, from what we're hearing, it may take 6, 12 months before we know what the final rules when they incorporate industry feedback look like? So how big of an unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans? Denis Coleman : Sure. So you have pieces of the answer to my question to the question for my answer. So what we would say, obviously, very pleased with the CCAR results -- we have 190 basis points of cushion. We intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there. We announced our increase in dividend. We've been very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and we're going to increase our level of buybacks. We are mindful of Basel III revisions but we also recognize that we will get a rule. There will be a comment period for the rule. There will be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. That implementation may even have a phase-in period. So as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. We obviously will make sure we're in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early -- but in the intervening period, we're going to continue to manage our capital to grow the firm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that, that intention is to step it up from where we are. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : David, there's been a fair amount of price speculation covering how you\u2019re -- the consumer business, specifically even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to partnership with Apple and GM. I know price speculation might not be representative of what's actually being discussed. So it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business, maybe how your vision has evolved in recent months just given some of the challenges facing that business and maybe not fitting with your -- aligning with your core competencies. David Solomon : Yes. So thanks for the question. And I frame it this way. As I think you know, we made difficult but appropriate decision over a year ago, working with our Board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out the fall, the direction of travel and have been executing on that. And that included the wind down and the execution of the markets the wind down of the execution of the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for GreenSky which we've been transparent on are in the process of. We've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. We don't have unilateral rights with them. They definitely can operate better. We've been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and we're making good progress on that. And we're working with Apple and also with GM to do that. And so there's a significant focus on reducing that drag. And the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024. We continue to have a very strong deposit platform. We launched an Apple savings platform which also was a successful launch to grow our deposit base. And so we'll continue to grow deposits and that's the course that we're on at the moment. Steven Chubak : It's great color. Maybe just for my follow-up on equity financing specifically. The contribution in the first half actually implies an incremental $1 billion in fees year-on-year. You've definitely been highlighting the commitment to grow the financing piece. And just wanted to better understand, one, the durability of the gains that you saw in the first half and as we look out over the next few years, how significant of a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the financing component both across equities as well as FIC? David Solomon : So I'm going to start with a high-level just strategic view of what I think we've done and we're focused on doing and then Dennis will give you a little bit more detail. But 1 of the things -- this has been a strategic priority for us because I certainly remember going back over the last decade, there were times where we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in a position with our clients and the equity franchise that we're in now. And there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time. But we've been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the financing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real difference. And so, I look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it; very good about what the team has accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. Now broadly, that financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is affected by risk on, risk off and overall market level activities. And so there can be variability in it but there's a base stability there that's much more meaningful than intermediation revenues. Dennis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective. Denis Coleman : Sure. So that is the strategic direction of travel. We are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital, financial capital to grow those activities Equities financing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenue this quarter and that's something that has been growing. Even the combined FIC and equities financing as a percentage of pick and equities continue to grow. So remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients. And we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. It's paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing David's comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior, there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the financing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base. So remain committed to growing that activity. It's relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items, it can fluctuate on the forward. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just one follow-up to that last question and then a different one. But just on the last question. So you mentioned durability when you were talking about financing, that was part of what I wanted to understand. Do you feel like this quarter of financing revenue is a good jump off point for us to grow from. And if there's any puts and takes on how you would think -- how would you want us to think about that level of durability, that would be helpful. Denis Coleman : Sure. So I'll comment both on FICC and equities. In fixed income, we had slightly softer performance over period-on-period. That was driven by a component of fixed financing which is more episodic which is commodities-based financing, those activity levels were a lot higher. And so I think you see lack of contribution from commodities-based financing activity that was in prior periods but I think the forward for other components of our fixed financing, like collateralized lending and repo, I think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities. I'm always cautious about predicting growth off of record performance. We're pleased with the equities financing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but we'll have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth but we do think there is still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues. Betsy Graseck : And you highlighted capital obviously have excess, significant excess. So there's that flex between buybacks versus deploy. This is an opportunity to deploy. I guess the follow-up I had to that was in your comments earlier on the Basel III end game. I think you mentioned that you -- look, you're in a position to be opportunistic, whether or not you want to meet the requirements early. And I guess that was the question I had on when you say on time, of course but early just meaning within that phase-in period early. And again, I kind of asked the question with the context of you've got this opportunity in financing. So how should I think through meeting it early versus leaning into financing versus other options you might have. David Solomon : Yes, Betsy. So look, I appreciate that. I think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this. And we're talking about years out. And so I think Dennis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in period, making sure we were getting there on time. But no, we are focused on deploying -- we generate a lot of capital because the firm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. We are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as we're talking about to deploy that in service of plants. Given the work we've done strategically, we now have much greater flexibility which gives us the option to look sharply as some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we felt we needed to be more cautious. And at the same point, we have more capacity, as Dennis said, to step up buybacks. You should view that we're very, very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and we'll be very thoughtful about the adjustment phase in of whatever comes when we understand it. But I'd just say there's a lot of uncertainty. It's a ways out; there's going to be comment periods. And so there's nothing going to be premature about what we do. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Look, I think you described here the rightsizing with investment equity debt CIE, the consumer and with head count is what were any [indiscernible] and where are you on the rightsizing of headcount? And the big picture question for David is simply, is this as bad as it gets? Do you feel comfortable that you captured everything with any severance to marches to GreenSky to CIE with debt investment -- debt equity investment and that you were conservative enough? Are we going to keep seeing 9% ROEs or does this accelerate your journey to that 15% midterm ROE? Denis Coleman : Okay. Mike, it's Dennis. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to David. So we called out our severance expense year-to-date was $260 million the vast majority of that was in the first quarter in connection with much, much larger levels of headcount reductions then. The reason that we're making an effort to call it out, you will also notice that our comp ratio net of business at 34%. We're just making an effort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance. And we think that's important because with the balance -- we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance Ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. So, the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the financial impact of the actions we've taken David will give you more color but we've largely done what we set out to do. We're on target for the payroll efficiencies and that I'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense. David Solomon : And Mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter of putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us. With respect to the balance sheet, I think one of the things that's very important to call out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. We are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter, if the environment improves, of positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too. But if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce. So I've been around the firm a long time. This was obviously a tough quarter but we also had one-off items that we put in. We're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to continue to move forward. I think the environment feels better, if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better, you'll see better performance. But I feel very, very good about the strategic decisions that we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in asset and wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment. Mike Mayo : And can you remind us -- so you're taking this pain the charges and you're looking to get to mid-teens ROE in the medium term. How do you define medium term? And what should we be looking at along the way because to the extent that this accelerates this transition. It'd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress? David Solomon : Well, we're going to make progress, Mike, over the next couple of years, the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make meaningful progress. But I'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, banking and markets, where we are a leader and I think given the mix of that business is performing well and what's not a perfect environment for that business, if that business, we really believe will deliver mid-teens through the cycle. The investment banking returns right now are at a very, very significant low but we do have a 14% ROE to date in Global Banking and Markets. So an improved environment should help us. The asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in February, it's going to take 2 to 3 more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift. And we're working on it. We see a clear line of sight and we're going to make progress. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : You spoke earlier to green shoots that you're seeing in the banking side given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise, curious to drill down and specifically understand what you're seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market recover before they can come back in full force? David Solomon : Yes. So thanks for that question, Brennan. It's a good question. It's an important thing. I'm glad you're asking us to highlight it because I think about it this way and it's very, very important. When you look at our M&A business, a significant contributor to our M&A business is M&A responses and that's come to a halt. It's come to a halt. There are 2 aspects of it. There's buy side and the sell side. The buy side obviously also give us financing and other capital markets activity. The sell side sometimes gives staple and financing opportunity, too but that stuff has kind of come to a hall. Here's one thing I know about financial sponsors. Number one, they own a bunch of assets. They're all for sale and they all will be sold. This environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate. And I think we're going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here. This has been a particularly slow environment for that. Secondly, they have enormous dry powder, okay? And they can't make money unless they deploy. And so as soon as you get to a place, the values reset and financing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy. We're starting to see some of that. You saw this quarter, obviously, a very, very big transaction around FIS. And so you're going, I think [indiscernible] as we move forward. So this is a very, very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment. And I'm not smart enough to tell you this quarter, next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and it's an important component to investment banking activity. And it's one of the reasons why investment in banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level, kind of 10-year lows. And the other part of your question, Brennan, speaks to availability and health of financing markets. I think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions. We believe we can distribute risk into the market. There's also a number of principal in buckets, both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying financing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the firm. Brennan Hawken : Great, I appreciate it. And then for my second, you started the process of selling GreenSky. We saw the goodwill impairment. What's been the reception to that asset? And has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could finalize that sale? Denis Coleman : Brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. We have feedback. I think extra color, just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward. It's a business we bought for $1.7 billion. We integrated into Goldman Sachs. We're seeing it perform well. It's a good business. We had made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right fit necessarily for Goldman Sachs. We've written down the goodwill in the Consumer platform segment. There's no more goodwill to be written down. That business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles approximately $625 million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so in the future. And should we move forward with the transaction with respect to GreenSky, it could happen in a number of different ways. We could sell the platform, we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet. And should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held for sale, much like the Marcus loans process and you'll see the P&L impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve. So those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but I don't think there's anything else to say about the GreenSky process given where we are. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : In markets we hit on financing. So I just want to look at intermediation here. And obviously, results were off quite a bit from a great quarter last year. But based on the results, it also looks like you did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter. So just the implication there would be that June got a lot better for intermediation. So I just want to make sure kind of that read is correct. And then did June feel like a more normal month relative to the first couple? And has that continued? Just trying to think about the quarter and the cadence there? David Solomon : Yes. So thanks, Kevin. I'd just say and you highlighted this appropriately, just pointing back. I mean, one of the big differences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we're coming out of the period where the word started in Russia and there was an enormous activity in the commodity space. And we were very, very well positioned to serve clients in that space. And so we -- if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didn't have that here. I think to the second part of your comment, yes, June was better. June was definitely better. And so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk on and what we're early in the quarter. But there's no question, there's more of a risk on sentiment in the month of July than it was earlier in the second quarter. And you just think about it, we're coming out of March, we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early April, we're in a very different place in terms of investor sentiment overall. So there has been an improvement through the quarter. And I think it's noted appropriately. Devin Ryan : Okay, that's great. And then just on transaction banking and the momentum there, be great to just get an update on some of the kind of the drivers. And really, the question is, it's such a huge market as you guys identified when you got the business. It's still a very small driver for Goldman. And so just trying to think about the growth there? And are there opportunities for more step function growth if you add a certain capability? Or just how should we think about the opportunity to really -- this to become a much bigger business for Goldman? David Solomon : So I appreciate that question. I think it's -- I think you're right. I think we've got an interesting platform. It's been very constructive in bringing deposits to Goldman Sachs. But one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the flow, so this delivers real revenue and real value over time, that's taking some time and it will take some time. I think it's a dispersed business where there are lots of providers for most people. These are our clients, so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged for this. They like our technology but making changes in payment flows takes time. So I think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment in building those relationships. I think a particular opportunity for us is around what I call kind of financial sponsor companies, etcetera. We're obviously given our financial sponsors franchise. We have a very, very good opportunity set over time. But this is going to take time to execute. I think it's one of those things where we have a business that's performing fine but it's not making a meaningful contribution. But I think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to figure out how this can make a more meaningful contribution to the firm with our client base. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : I wanted to ask about private banking and lending, even ex the $100 million gain this quarter. That continues to be an area of growth. Can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward and the inputs to kind of continue the lower growth you've seen? David Solomon : Sure. So it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall Asset & Wealth Management business which we think has the combined benefit of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues, there's a couple of components inside of that line item. We've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our Marcus loans activities which on the for those will obviously have -- will not be contributing on the forward. But the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities. And we have, as I think David highlighted earlier, premium ultra-high net worth business that has been growing nicely. But we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space. And so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very, very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect that will be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward. Daniel Fannon : Great. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook and as you think about line of sight which I think you used to give us some numbers and given capital markets may be opening up and a little bit more receptive to exit anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the short term that you're planning on or have as I said, line of sight on? David Solomon : Sure. I appreciate that question. So obviously, we took you to current on historical principal investments at 23.8%. You know that there is a year-end '24 target of below $15 billion. We said we are well on pace towards that target. I would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. We have a large number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. They're all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on offer to being marketed to being prepared. We've moved a large number of positions year-to-date and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. So I would offer that up as it's an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress. Operator : We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: So the SCB obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now. We are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. And specifically with the sale of the Marcus loans and potentially sale of GreenSky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. I guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the SCB? Or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual FACA. David Solomon : Sure. So look, you're familiar with the process as we are. There's various levels of transparency that you get through the process. Obviously, those contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test. But the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our SCB towards the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. We think that has a very, very meaningful impact for us. And the thing I would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this SCB of 5.5% due to be implemented in October, that's based on the snapshot of activity that the Fed took last year which means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. And assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which I don't know. But if it is, we will continue to see benefit from our reduction of these on balance sheet investments. So the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that, that's a very, very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until, obviously, any new news on that front. Matt O'Connor: Okay. So focus much more on the legacy on balance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios? David Solomon : Yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : David, in your opening comments, you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a mid-teens ROE through the cycle. We all know the business has been depressed as you pointed out in your comments. Can you share with us, if you go -- we have -- the public has access to the geologic data your data is probably better than that. But if you look at the geologic data for '21 and '22, obviously, global investment banking revenues were unusually strong. Why would you think is a normal level for global investment banking revenues that you need to get to that mid-teens ROE that you're targeting? David Solomon : So again, I'd highlight that Global Banking and Markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% ROE for the first 6 months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. We don't disclose the separate ROE for investment banking but I just highlight to you, it's running way, way below what it's run on average over the course of the last 5 in the last 10 years. We do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking ROE which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle uplift of our Global Banking and Markets franchise. I'm sure in my lifetime, maybe not my career, I'll see another year like 2021 but 2021 falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade, I wouldn't call that normal either. But I would say that this is not normal and normalize somewhere in between. Our average, I hate the word normal, average lies somewhere in between. Denis Coleman : The only thing I would add which I'm sure is intuited to, Gerard, some of the activities that are not contributing us substantially right now are very capital-efficient activities. And so looking at deal logic levels of activity or revenues are 1 metric but some of them are very, very beneficial to our overall results. And they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. So in environments of more active levels of investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the firm that's not necessarily captured simply from the Delta explained in that investment banking line. David Solomon : Yes. One other thing, Gerard, I'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. If you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. There's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. You can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. You can see that from 2001 to 2002. You can see that from 2007 to 2008. You can see that in 2010 to 2011. And obviously, you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. What's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy, etcetera, I don't think it's going to be different this time. I think this is a cycle. We haven't seen a cycle in a while. And the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity, IPOs, equity financing, destiny, that's a fundamental part of our economy. It's not going away. It's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful. And then Dennis, a technical question for you on GreenSky. You mentioned that you still have intangibles and you are going to think -- or you still have a determination to make whether GreenSky should move into held for sale. Two-part question. What will trigger that to move it into held for sale? Then should you do that? And if there's an intangible impairment, do you have to take that impairment at that time when you move it into held for sale or you can wait for a later date? David Solomon : So, thank you. The decision as to whether and when we move it to held for sale is when we make a decision affirmatively that we are selling the business and we're selling the loan portfolio and we will. When we make that decision, we will designate it as such and you will see the P&L consequences of that designation at that point in time. We evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment. And in the next quarter, we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. James Mitchell : Just on Platform Solutions profitability. I appreciate you getting to an efficiency ratio already below 100%. But the other drag on profits is credit. I think you guys noted that in consumer platforms had a 5.8% net charge-off ratio. I would imagine point of sale is lower than cards. So that would imply cards as well north of 6% in terms of that charge-off ratio. How do we -- is that right? And how do we think about the credit quality in that book and where you see it kind of normalizing? SP1 Sure. So a couple of things. On the one hand, the net charge-off in consumer at 5 for the quarter, given the nature of our portfolio, its maturity, the overall operating environment we do expect that, that will continue to tick up over the next couple of quarters. Carey Halio : But you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well. And that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected. We had put together provisions on a conservative basis. And now as we have more and more data coming through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio. So I'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated. James Mitchell : Okay. Maybe just a follow-up question on Wealth Management. I haven't really talked about it in a while but whether it's with AECO and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultra-high net port space. Can you talk to the progress you've made there? And what kind of where you're seeing investments in growth? David Solomon : So AECO, within the overall platform, ACO is something we continue to grow. We continue to be focused on. It's extremely well received, in particular, by a number of our C-suite clients. It's part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. We do see opportunities to continue to expand our offering. We also see opportunities to expand within the ultra-high net worth space, both in the United States and abroad and we have a very, very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise under-penetrated and continue to grow that as well. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. Please continue with any closing remarks. Carey Halio : Yes. We just want to thank you for joining. And obviously, if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Johan and the rest of the team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you, everybody.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Taryn and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. This call is being recorded today, October 17th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference. David Solomon : Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the Middle East. We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region, and it's very concerning for many of us around the world. We obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds. Earlier this month, I marked the end of my fifth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic about the firm, and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise, and our growing Asset & Wealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle. As I reflect on the past five years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the same, long track record of being a trusted adviser to the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals. A global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions, an aspirational brand, exceptional people and a culture of collaboration and excellence. Additionally, over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice and execution capabilities has strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today, our client franchise is as strong as ever, enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients. For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day, there have been four marquee IPOs priced in the United States, Arm Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and Birkenstock. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires long-standing client relationships, deep market expertise and experience. Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospects of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity. As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tail [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs. In Asset & Wealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years, we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. We are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees. While market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus, and we have made significant progress on these priorities. Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we've seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned. Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it. We, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial system. There are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, which is driving the needs of much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity, simplified businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector. Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country. Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal. The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the US, material improvement in the -- soundness of the banking system. We, alongside clients and others in the industry, have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately, changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business, and we remain firmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover financial results for the quarter. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in a [indiscernible] and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong progress across a number of activities. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points. These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & Wealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky, which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally, we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page four. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date, we ranked Number One in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and ranked number two in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from a strong performance last year, particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $730 million grow sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally, we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September. As we spoke about at our Investor Day, alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us, and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives, while equities financing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter. Total financing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our financing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our first Investor Day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. We are raising the floor in Global Banking & Markets as reflected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across Investment Banking. Now moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page five. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year, as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset by our sale of substantially all of the market loan portfolio. We remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period. Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. We saw $11 billion of liquidity inflows and $7 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs Vintage Fund IX in the third quarter, our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. We are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions, page eight. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held for sale. On page nine firm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, flat with the prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio, offset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter. On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter. CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired office-related exposures by approximately 50% this year. Now turning to expenses on page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024 and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efficiencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive. Quarterly non-compensation expense were $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in the intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While onetime expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efficiency goal. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, high versus the first half due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of under 23%. Now onto slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks so much. I guess just big picture, if we add back all the significant items in the quarter, we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. I know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuff. So I wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator. So I wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much is -- comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? How much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? I know it's tough but I want to say high level [indiscernible] pieces and thanks. David Solomon : Sure, Glenn, and appreciate the question. And so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about Basel III. But first, we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the firm to be in two core businesses, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. Investment Banking activities are well below 10-year norms. I don't think that will stay that way. But if you look at the performance of the business through nine months, that business, which is kind of 7% of the firm, that is two-thirds to 70% of the firm, that business is operating with a 13.4% ROE and an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. I can't tell you when the environment will get better, but I do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. History tells us that it doesn't stay short -- it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time. There is an adjustment. We're making the adjustment. Yes, the world's uncertain. As we mentioned, that could be a headwind. But I do think it will improve. And that business performs well. And we firmly believe that, that business is a mid-teens through the cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our financing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business. Second, we have the Asset & Wealth Management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal and make it a lower capital business. We're on that journey. I think you see us making progress. We've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We set a target for $15 billion by next year, which we'll meet and then close to zero two years later. And so that business, we have a high degree of confidence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. As we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. We're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. And we're relatively confident that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. So you add that up with what we have and I think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target. Now, the Basel rules. The Basel rules, if they were implemented as they're position now would be a headwind to that but also that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass through pricing. We've seen things before. I'm not to saying it won't be a headwind, but I don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. So we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. And when there's more clarity on Basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view. But I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. I'm not saying you are. I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. One quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. You mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates. I'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is. I'm thinking from more of the big picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear. Thanks. David Solomon : Yes. Glenn, as I listened to you play it back, what I'd say, US economy has been more resilient. The fiscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. I'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy, we will see more sluggishness. Now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly, there's a good debate on where this all lands. But we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. And I just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy, not all, but most sectors of the economy. And I do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. I am hearing as I interact with CEOs, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. I don't want to over-amplify that because I think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. But I think that gear from watching closely. Glenn Schorr : Thanks so much. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess maybe just one first follow-up, Denis. I just want to make sure I heard you correct. Did you say you marked your CRE exposure by 50% in CRE office? And on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond office CRE. Clearly, it's a very manageable issue for you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. How much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, yes, to clarify, for our CRE and CIE exposure in the office space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year. So that's -- I think that's quite significant. We started the year with about $15 billion of CRE alternative investments. That's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. So we're making very, very significant progress against those exposures. If you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-office, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. So we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reflected the valuations in those positions. But as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just a separate question. I mean, I think the capital markets environment, it is what it is. When you look at the firm over the next year or two, if maybe, David, where do you see the best growth opportunities? One, maybe talk about the client franchise and cap markets financing. Is that getting better or worse? And then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. You've talked about credit being an opportunity. Just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two? David Solomon : Sure. So in our Global Banking & Markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. We expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or three as opposed to just top three. And so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. So that's not most significant. We are growing our financing for our Global Banking & Markets franchise, and we expect to continue to grow that financing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward growing that financing footprint. And we do think that it has reasonable returns. And it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a significant financer with them. When you turn to Asset & Wealth Management, I think we've been very clear at our Investor Day, and Mark stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single-digits. That is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector, where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in Wealth Management to grow the franchise all over the world. And we've made continued progress on that journey. When you talk about private credit, we have, as you know, over $100 billion of private credit. We've launched private credit vehicles. We obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at Global Banking & Markets. And what we do with financing, which we think can also be an Asset & Wealth Management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise. So those are a handful of things I'd highlight at this point. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Christian Bolu : Good morning. Just another one on Basel III Endgame. I appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that. But now that you've had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it affects the competitiveness of your markets businesses? Are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted? And then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions. David Solomon : Sure, Christian. I appreciate it. I mean, I'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all fluid. But obviously, if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an effect of the businesses. But it's different from business to business. There are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. A corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative. I can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher. Obviously, it's some balance, they would think about that differently. There are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new Basel rules, the terms don't look attractive. But there are others, and one I'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a significant part of the impact to us would be is prime, okay? There aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. There are very few in Europe, a little bit, and obviously, the Europeans, if this was implemented this way, would have an advantage. But at the end of the day, there are a handful of scale players. There are lots of scale institutions that need that service. Our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way. We'd have to look at the final rules. We'd have to adjust. So it will affect behavior. It will affect pricing. It will affect optimization. But I know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer, I think you need to see the rules, and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality, whatever it is. And it's not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry that are obviously be a process of working through that, as we have in the past. Christian Bolu : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Maybe a question on the platform businesses here. I just have a two-part question. I guess firstly, maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the partnership with Apple. Can the economics work for Goldman in the current states or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership? And then the second question is more on the credit quality in your senior credit cards. Kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? How does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry? David Solomon : All right. I'll start on the first part, Denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. First, I think we hired a gentleman, Bill Johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. As we've stated to you a number of times, and I'll repeat it here very clearly, we've worked to narrow our focus. You've seen us execute around Marcus loans and GreenSky. Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships. So our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag and bringing them to profitability. And we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. And Bill Johnson joining is helping with all that. We'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for Goldman Sachs. But our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better. Denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing? Denis Coleman : Sure. What I'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. A couple of things to bear in mind. In Consumer, the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-offs down as well. You'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. That adjustment is basically a function of GreenSky being removed from that ratio. And so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now. On the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. We made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment. Christian Bolu : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. So David you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. I was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efficiency goal? And maybe more specifically, given changes in revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightened competition you cited, how that's going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all? David Solomon : Yes. So we continue to be committed to the 60% efficiency ratio. But as you know, we're moving through, we're narrowing our focus. We're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, Steven, and highlight for you. I'm going to turn to Denis to make sure that we get the number right. But ex those one-off items, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been? Denis Coleman : About 64.6%. David Solomon : Okay. So putting it in perspective, I think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity. We're trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our Global Banking & Markets business and our Asset & Wealth Management platform, we think we have the right target. Now back to your point, Steve, about competition. The competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very, very strong. And so we think we've got a very, very good talent ecosystem. I feel good about the hiring we're doing. I'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out of university, we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. There are over 1 million applications for employment at Goldman Sachs last year. Very, very aspirational and desirous place to work, but the competition for talent remains high. And so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. You heard Denis talk about some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of our best talent. We feel good about where we are, but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy, which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, that the efficiency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target. Steven Chubak : That's great color. And just for my follow-up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. Alts fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip, but PE is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the LP denominator effect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. I was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor booking activity as well as the alternative asset management business. David Solomon : Sure. So that broadly defined sponsor community, Steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the first thing I'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very, very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. I think there's some very, very interesting macro dynamics. I believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way, charitable foundations who also invest. So there's a very, very strong dynamic of good flows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes. And so we believe that's firmly intact. There's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. I would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very, very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodated. But there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher. The one thing I know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses, and they also make money when they buy new assets. They obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now. And what I'd say is for the last six quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. In our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. And I would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales. It's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases. I'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. That would not be the norm, but if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity, the sponsor activity would make up, I would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. And at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time. Steven Chubak : Very helpful, David. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my questions I'd love to start on expenses and comp, and David, you just spoke a little to this when answering Steven's question. But the comp ratio, we saw revenue growth broadly quarter-over-quarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for Goldman. Denis, I know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. Was some of that in the third quarter or was there any unusual items impacting the comp ratio? Or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent? Thanks. Denis Coleman : So in terms of third quarter, it was very, very small. We previously disclosed $260 million of severance so there's a small amount of severance in the quarter. We just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year. That obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year. And we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. And we're looking in top composition this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance, but also recognizing, in particular, across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in Global Banking & Markets, record year-to-date financing activity, record management fees year-to-date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. And these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. And we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that, Denis. And then when you're thinking about -- thanks for all the color on those CRE and the exposures. When you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you're intending to continue to sell by the end of next year, what portion of those are CRE or CRE-related? Is it possible to give any color around the assets that you're looking to sell and how exposed they are to CRE or other sectors? Denis Coleman : Sure. So I made a comment earlier. If you look at aggregate CRE-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities, and remaining exposure of equity in our CIE portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion and down already $5 billion year-to-date. There are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firm-wide activities, our CRA obligations and some co-invest exposures. If you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the CRE on-balance sheet investments is HPI, and that's what we're looking to sell down over time. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. The pivot's not new. It's been advertised. I guess what's new is the actual losses. So looking back, who is accountable and who pays the price for the losses with GreenSky, the Marcus loans and a consumer expansion strategy that was wider than you want it to be now? And then looking ahead, once you eliminate what you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments, how much would that alone improve ROE? Thanks. David Solomon : Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. The leadership of the firm, which includes myself and the other senior leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people. So obviously, we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make. I said publicly before that I'm happy that we pivoted. As you say, the pivot is not new. We've made the pivot. We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight, you will do certain things differently. We obviously reflect. We learn from the things that we do. But I think it's important for companies to try things, for companies to learn and adapt. When you make a decision that you think is a wrong decision for shareholders and the firm, you adjust accordingly. So we're doing that and we're moving forward. The second part of the question was? Mike Mayo : How much does ROE improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of? David Solomon : Well, I think we've given you a bunch of transparency, Mike, just looking at this. But if you look at what created a drag to ROE this quarter, 75% of the drag to ROE this quarter were the impairments and the rough [indiscernible] on the historical principal investments. And if you look over the last few quarters, the most significant impact on ROE performance has been the historical principal investments. Now also, there were benefits from those historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that. We think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're driving that. I think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. You can see the banking and markets ROE right now and also the forward ROE of the Asset & Wealth Management business with less capital in it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated. And so that will give you a cleaner ROE that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle. Mike Mayo : And then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks? Basel III, of course. But to the extent that you're discarding of the principal investments, that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere. Kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations? David Solomon : Yes. So I think Denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've built a pretty big cushion and buffer, given that we successfully reduced our SCD based on actions we're taking. We think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more benefit to SCD. Now obviously, Basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity. But we will continue to buy back stock. We will continue to pay our dividend. And as we have clarity under this strategy, there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately benefit to further buyback. But at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we flow ahead. Mike Mayo : All right thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. The floor is yours. Ryan Kenny : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets, maybe asked another way. So trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. Industry wallet and both fixed income and equities is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels, and you've been taking share. But looking forward, is there any scenario related to Basel Endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink? And as you think about higher for longer rates, how do you expect that, that impacts the various trading businesses? David Solomon : Look, I think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues. The growth of the government in the world continues. The market capital world continues to grow and expand. I can't and I won't speculate on exactly where the final Basel rules wind up and how everyone optimizes through all that, but I don't think anything is changing in intermediation. And the need to finance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing. And so I continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprint and are in a leading position in these markets businesses, I think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. Of course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses. But I think the businesses will continue to perform very, very well. Ryan Kenny : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Devin Ryan : Thank you. Good morning, David and Denis. Want to come back to Wealth Management. I know that the sale of Personal Financial Management is a small business. But just if you can remind us how and where you want to compete in Wealth Management moving forward. And David, maybe give a little more color on some of those growth opportunities you alluded to that you're seeing there across the globe. Thank you. David Solomon : Yes. So I appreciate that question, Devin. Our focus is on ultra-high net worth management where we have a leading franchise. I just highlight that ultra-high net worth management -- high net worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business. And while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid-single-digit share and we have less share than that in places like Europe around the world. We've seen really good growth in Europe. We see continued growth in the US. We have an ability as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business. We've seen good growth over the last five years. I think we have neat run rate room to do that. One of the decisions we made, and again, this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned is by selling United Capital and selling PFM, which was a small business, as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared towards growing that and add it to our investment in ultra-high net worth growth. And we think that's a better returning business and something we're very confident that we can continue to execute on. Devin Ryan : Okay, terrific. And then just a quick follow-up. So the $15 billion capital call facilities with Signature Bank, it sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers. And you framed out obviously why that's such an important customer base for Goldman Sachs. So if you can, maybe give us a little flavor for how that's going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsorships, given how important they are as a customer for Wall Street, whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top three or where you can go from three to number one? Or just any flavor for where your market share opportunities exist there? David Solomon : Sure. In traditional investment banking services, we have leading share with sponsors across M&A and leveraged finance. These capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business. And while we've been in the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us. One of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity, and it gives us an attachment to them. So this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we run meaningfully. Again, I made this comment when we were talking about the Global Banking & Markets business, financing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the financing is important to them. And so as we continue to finance sponsors, I think it strengthens ready, very strong position with the sponsor community. Devin Ryan : Understood. Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Platform Solutions. So for the quarter, if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? And as you think about achieving your target of profitability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? And if you could also just give an outlook for Transaction Banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you for the question. I don't think it's the right run rate. I think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efficiency with respect to expenses. So I think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. I think on Transaction Banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. We had grown quickly. We're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high-quality deposits. As you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially, I think, reasonably in line with the industry, given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. But we did grow our client count. We remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall Investment Banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for Goldman Sachs. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. And as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives and the fundraising at the private equity challenges. But maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're in the market with today. And then also, as you think about the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives, how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward? And when should we start to see those become a more material component of the overall revenue profile? Denis Coleman : So on the alternative space, our fundraising activity, $15 billion in the quarter, $40 billion year-to-date has been broad-based. We have a broad-based platform. We have mentioned the secondaries fund. David covered some of the private credit spaces. These are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. They're particularly relevant. We expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly. Incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry. So incentive fees will be lumpy. It will depend on the performance of different funds, but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. When we laid out at Investor Day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that David covered earlier, but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. So I think that's a source of upside for us. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David, in the past, you -- and you talked about the IPOs, the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter. But in the past, you talked about green shoots, and part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations today are far below where they were in 2021 at the peak of the cycle. Are you finding those conversations easier today or are you finding more people are recognizing that's correct? And if they want to go public, they just had to accept it? David Solomon : Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think absolutely, they're easier. And if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now. But I don't think those discussions are difficult. I think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. And I think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to enhance themselves strategically. Denis Coleman : And Gerard, I'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in market, both space for equities and across the leveraged finance space. So the conversations that we're having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets. They're informed by our leading role in insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. And so I think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. But can you share with us some of the color in the Transaction Banking area? That was obviously a new business line that you guys created. Just how is it going? I saw the revenues were down slightly, I think, sequentially. But what's going on in that line of business? And again, granted it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time. Denis Coleman : Sure. No. Thanks, Gerard. Our Transaction Banking activity remains a strategic focus. The revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those things are linked. We have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. No change in strategy. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. The floor is yours. Saul Martinez : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on Platform Solutions. I think, Denis, you mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. But even this quarter, if I adjust for the loan markdown and the impairment, it seems like you -- my math is correct, you are PPNR positive. Obviously, credit costs are high, the credit card book is seasoning and you're still growing that portfolio. But if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to -- or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say, 24 months? Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks, Saul. So just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question in the context. So rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very, very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with CECL. We expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further, and that has some positive impacts. And then as David mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. I mean, we're working very, very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. We remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for Goldman Sachs. I think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with we manage the expense and the operating efficiency. Saul Martinez : Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe a quick follow-up there. I think you mentioned that NCOs, net charge-offs, were down this quarter. Is that -- and you do have a 13.3 reserve coverage. It does seem like your maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under CECL. But just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. And is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years? Denis Coleman : So you have a couple of facts that are right. We did have a charge-off ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-offs. We are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. It's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. We do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. So as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-offs. And as you look at our reporting on that with GreenSky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-offs. Saul Martinez : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question, we'll return to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just a clarification on my prior question. So if I have this right, you reduced your PE investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter, and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the Asset Management and Wealth segment. I mean, is that completely correlated. So if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, would that free up, say, $16 billion? Is that ballpark right? Denis Coleman : No. Mike, I think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. So I don't think -- I'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but I don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, significantly less than that. Mike Mayo : So how much do you have left that once you discard the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be freed up? Denis Coleman : I mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. So we probably have remaining mid-single digits. Mike Mayo : Okay. And as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be excluded when we think about our models? Denis Coleman : So we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. We do think of them as more onetime in nature. We, as you know, did a headcount reduction earlier in this year. That's not our current expectation to repeat that. If anything, we think that the work we've done to right-size the firm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. So we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. And we are taking into account as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the firm. We're very focused on pertaining to continue to drive the franchise. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, January 16th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference. David Solomon : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year. The US economy proved to be more resilient than expected, despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a significant tightening of financial conditions, regional bank failures, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was the year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the first half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. We are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity, which is reflected in our backlog. I am starting today's presentation with a strategic update, and Denis will provide comments on the financial results. Beginning on page one, we aspire to be the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity, and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands in financial services. Goldman Sachs is a preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. We've continued to simplify our strategy, and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on page two, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well-positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business. It also includes our number one equities franchise and top three FICC franchise. We are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our unified Asset & Wealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top five alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision and where we see significant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On page three, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC and equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. We generated record total financing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth in a more durable revenue base of management, other fees, and private banking and lending revenues. This past year, we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion, and also surpassed our five-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. We exited the Marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. We sold our Personal Financial Management business. We announced the sale of GreenSky, which remains on track to close this quarter. We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter. We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer. We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities. I firmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth. But it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to grow further from here. These deposits have materially improved the firm's funding profile. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows the firm to operate more efficiently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable. And we need to be measured and focused in our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale, and exceptional talent. On page four, in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversified franchise has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted effort to grow our wallet share and financing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue floor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last four years. Turning to page five, a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our efforts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. We've maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed M&A, number one in equity and equity-related underwriting, number two in high yield debt. In FICC and equities, we're in the top three with 117 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reflection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' confidence in us. In addition, we have significantly increased more durable financing revenue. FICC and equity financing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management on page six. We've continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. We've also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pre-tax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to page seven. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inflows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds, while on alternatives, over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last five years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early. This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation and developing new strategy, as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. I'm very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our first Investor Day four years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of $150 billion seemed. We\u2019ve surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on page eight, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the firm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represents the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory, underwriting, and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company, it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from financing, management, and other fees, as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together, these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across different market environments because of our diversified franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversification of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue-generating power of our firm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a significant amount of time in 2023 realigning the firm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values, and our strengths, which we highlighted on page nine. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence. Second, to run world-class, differentiated, and durable businesses. Third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture. Exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes, to continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people, and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very confident about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence, and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made significant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions, as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04, and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year, down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than offset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year, driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed M&A as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high yield debt underwriting. Our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, driven by a significant increase in advisory. As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base. And though we're only two weeks into the New Year, there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the US and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2 billion in the quarter, down 24% from strong performance last year, amid lower activity in rates and other macro products. In FICC financing, revenues rose to a record $739 million. Equities net revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. The year-over-year increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives. Financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose year-over-year with continued strength on higher average balances. Across FICC and equities, financing revenues rose 10% in 2023, consistent with our priority to grow client financing. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 14. For 2023, revenues of $13.9 billion rose 4% year-over-year, as an increase in more durable revenues, including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues, offset a decline in equity investments revenues and incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.4 billion were up 9% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $9.5 billion, putting us on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024, notwithstanding the sale of our PFM business. Equity investments produced net revenues of $838 million, higher year-over-year, driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Results in this line item also included a gain of $349 million from the sale of PFM. Moving on to page 15. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and alternative assets, and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. Turning to page 16 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $295 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $571 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, surpassing our $2 billion target for 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $32 billion for the quarter and $72 billion for the year. As David mentioned, third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day now stands at over $250 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $46 billion, of which roughly $16 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $4 billion, including sales of $3 billion of CIEs across over 40 positions, bringing reductions for the year to $13 billion. We continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the medium-term, though we don't expect portfolio reductions in 2024 to be at the same pace as in 2023. I'll now turn to platform solutions on page 17. Full year revenues were $2.4 billion, up 58% versus 2022. Quarterly net revenues of $577 million were up 12% year-over-year on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances. As David mentioned, we reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer, the impact of which was to move the loans to held for sale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately $160 million. We have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time. On page 18, firm-wide net interest income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter was down 13% relative to the third quarter, reflecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $183 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending, which includes the pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities we won at auction in October. Our provision for credit losses was $577 million. In relation to our consumer portfolio, provisions were driven by net charge-offs and seasonal balance growth, partially offset by the GM reserve release I mentioned. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters, with roughly half related to CRE. Let's turn to expenses on page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $34.5 billion, excluding severance-related costs of $310 million, compensation expense was flat year-over-year, amid solid core performance, and as the market for talent remains competitive. As of the fourth quarter, we achieved our goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies, which allowed us to continue investing in our talent. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion, and included CIE impairments of $262 million. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was 20.7%. For 2024, we expect a tax rate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on slide 21. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.5% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, 150 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $311 and common stock dividends of $922 million. While we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return, given the ongoing uncertainty around the Basel III proposed rule, our capital management philosophy is unchanged. We prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities, sustainably growing our dividend, and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks, particularly when valuation levels are attractive. In conclusion, we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in 2023 with our execution driving a much stronger platform for 2024. Our best-in-class core businesses are well-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives. We will continue to Harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class differentiated and durable businesses, and invest to operate our businesses at scale. Additionally, the execution focus areas we've identified for 2024 will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients, our people, and our shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So I wanted to get a mark-to-market. You've been rightfully cautious but optimistic on green shoots becoming reality in investment banking. You definitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter. So curious -- and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarter-on-quarter. So maybe just differentiate between what you're seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the mark-to-market on how you're feeling. Thanks. David Solomon : Sure. Sure, Glenn. I mean, just at a base level, I'm pretty optimistic, given the way we've got the firm positioned. And there's no question that these capital markets and M&A activity levels have been depressed. As I've said before, I don't think that continues year-on-year-on year, and we really started to see, in the second half of this year, real improvement. As Denis highlighted, the M&A backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter. And I'd just highlight, and I know this is obvious, but I think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of M&A revenue. If the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up, plus then have growth. And so, that's a very, very strong replenishment. And I would just say the level of strategic dialogue has definitely increased and we're seeing it across our platform. I'm encouraged by capital markets activity. I'm not going to say, it's running back to 10-year averages right away, but it has materially improved. I do think you're going to see some more meaningful IPOs in 2024. And we are just, across debt and equity issuance, seeing more activity, more engagement. At the end of the day, people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. So when I look broadly, it feels better. There's a lot going on in the world. And so I think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time about the 2% of things that can go wrong. So we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the firm, but I do think the firm is incredibly well-levered to this pickup, and it feels better is the way I'd frame it. Glenn Schorr : All right. Cool. Maybe just to follow-up on that note. Reducing the on-balance sheet investments, as you mentioned, is an important part of the ROE improvement for Asset & Wealth and for Goldman overall. So with that said, the markets are higher, pipeline's better. How come the balance sheet reduction of on-balance sheet investments might be slower this year when the intent, I think, is to get rid of all of it at the right price? David Solomon : Yeah, first of all, I think we made a lot of progress last year. And so if you look at what we accomplished, I think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. One of the things that happened is we pulled some stuff forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. And so to be clear, our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible. If you're operating inside this firm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible. But we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately. We set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero. My guess is, we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. All right, thanks, David. David Solomon : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just wanted to spend some time on the FICC business. So if I'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like FICC revenues are now back to pre-COVID levels if you go back to 1Q of '19. Maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at slide 13, seemed like most products were quite weak. Give us some perspective around does both -- the intermediation piece of FICC, does that feel like we are close to trough, and unlike seasonality, we should see some improvement in FICC from here, if you can just provide some perspective there. David Solomon : Sure. I mean, at a high level, what I would say, this quarter, intermediation activity was quiet, and particularly in the back half of the quarter, kind of late November and December, clients were quiet. If you look at the whole year, I don't think it's fair, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think it's fair to say the whole year is back to '19 levels. The overall activity levels were up and down during the year. We have a big diversified business. When our clients are active, we execute on it, we continue to grow the financing revenues, which make it overall more durable. But it was a quiet quarter, particularly the back half, in terms of intermediation. I don't expect it to continue at that pace. I think Denis' comments in the opening, we're seeing more activity in the first few weeks of the year. But we'll watch it. And as you know, that activity, particularly in that segment, can move up and down based on what's going on in the macro environment. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And maybe just sticking to FICC or maybe both FICC and Equity. On the financing side, if you don't mind reminding us of the opportunity to grow financing over the next year or over the medium-term. Thank you. Denis Coleman : So, thanks, Ebrahim. So we've been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both FICC and equity financing. And it's a virtuous activity for us. It dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share. We have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into FICC and equities. We now have leading equities franchise overall. Our equities financing business is in a leadership position and at scale. It has grown significantly and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients on the platform. So we look out into 2024 and 2025. We continue to be very focused. I think there's good opportunities across both FICC and equity financing in GBM. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Mr. Hawken, please go ahead. Your line is open. Please check your mute function. Brennan Hawken : Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. So just curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the Apple relationship. I know it's an ongoing thing, but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could flow through? David Solomon : Denis said in his comments, we've got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated. We continue to work with Apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership, and we continue to make good progress. And the drag in 2024 will be materially less. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Appreciate that. And then when you think about the deposit platform, Marcus, that's been a pretty bright spot on the consumer front and definitely seems to have worked well. What has been your views or how has the beta on that deposit base played out versus your expectations? And do you have any plans to adjust your thoughts around, you know, earlier you talked about wanting to be in the top decile of payouts for that product. Is that still the goal or has that adjusted as the platform has matured? Denis Coleman : Sure, Brennan, and thank you for that question. Our Marcus, deposit platform, has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall firm-wide funding. We did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher-end of the pricing envelope to maintain, sustain, and grow our balances across that platform. We haven't adjusted our strategy at this point. We saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year, not just Marcus. Overall, deposits are up over $40 billion on the year. And I would just say, as we move into 2024, we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey, David. You started off the call saying that 2023 was the year of execution and that's the year when you had an ROE of 8%, and if we throw in some of the charges, it's 10%, and that's not really executing at your 15% or so desired return. So can you give us a kind of waterfall chart in words on how you get from that core 10% ROE to 15%, and if you could define medium-term? David Solomon : Sure. So I appreciate the question, Mike, and obviously, we're very focused on it. It wasn't an A environment for our core business. In fact, I don't even think it was a B environment. When investment banking is operating at low levels, that is an impact overall. I do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very significant portion of the firm and do note, on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a B-plus or an A environment, given the investment banking activity, it had a 12% ROE. We continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a mid-teens business. And so I don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at. We have that business positioned very well. And so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. And then secondarily, on Asset & Wealth Management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. The balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but I think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the Asset & Wealth Management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns or better with a 25% margin. We're on that journey. We're making progress. I think we'll make very good progress over the next two years. And if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the firm, and I think they can operate mid-teens. We've significantly reduced the other drags. We got a lot of it behind us in this year. That doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. And so I think we're making good progress in the medium-term is over the next couple of years, provided it's -- provided that it's a reasonable environment. And so I think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the firm over the next three to five years. Mike Mayo : And then just to follow-up that other drag, you said would be a lot less than 2024 from Platform Solutions. And can you dimension that a little bit? And also, as it relates to principal investments, do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much? David Solomon : They absolutely do. I mean, when markets improve, they help the disposition. There's no question. I also -- when you look at the last two years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. With a better market, you actually might have some benefit to revenue performance, but we're focused on reducing that broadly. You see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on GreenSky, move GM to held for sale. And so you have more transparency on that. We think the drag will be significantly reduced in 2024. When we're comfortable providing more specific color on that, we will provide it. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. David Solomon : But small in the overall context of the firm and the firm's performance. Denis Coleman : Yeah. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thanks. David Solomon : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Devin Ryan : Thanks so much. Morning, David and Denis. Question just on kind of interplay between a recovery in investment banking versus trading intermediation. And I know there's probably a lot of assumptions that need to go in here. But if you think about kind of the environment with macro conditions settling down, which would likely support investment banking, I'm assuming some areas of trading could also slow down and then maybe other areas could pick up as well. So just love to maybe hear a little bit about kind of the puts and takes, kind of what you've seen historically there, if easier. And just really kind of the key question is, just whether you can grow investment banking revenues and trading ex-financing at the same time. Thanks. Denis Coleman : Yeah, so at a high level, Devin, appreciate the question. I think we can continue to grow our financing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing, and we will normalize investment banking activity. And obviously, over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market capital world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity. When there's real disruption in the world, we find that FICC can be a little bit countercyclical in some way, shape or form. But that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity. I think there's a lot going on in the world. The trajectory of rates, there's a point of view on rates and inflation, but it's certainly not certain to me. I think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. There's debates about how the Fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. And so all of this, I think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. So I do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. I think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. But I'm not a good predictor, and we're prepared to operate whatever environment we have to operate in. Devin Ryan : Understood. I appreciate that, David. Maybe a quick follow up for Denis. Just commercial real estate, clearly big headwind in 2023. Appreciate all the disclosure. Their office on-balance sheet is only $1 billion now. So when you think about just the environment relative to current marks, how do you feel about kind of the pain being behind the Company and just characterize the environment where maybe there still could be material marks? And then just more broadly kind of expectations for marks as you exit the historical CRE on-balance sheet principal investments. Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure, Devin. Thank you. And as you know, we have new disclosure the last couple of quarters on CRE in particular on the nature of the loans in that sector. And then as well as the on-balance sheet, both CRE and office in particular. You can obviously see from those disclosures, we've made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of 2023, gave disclosure on the number of CIE positions that we moved down recently, and we've made really significant progress. We disclosed on prior calls and our office exposures from an impairment and marks perspective, we're sitting at roughly 50%. So we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of 2023 that that portfolio, and the broader portfolio for that matter, sits at the right place. As we move into 2024, there should be opportunities for further dispositions and we'll remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is. When David was reviewing our expectations with respect to HPI sell-down on the forward, in addition to moving towards our medium-term target, we're also mindful of what the long-term franchise impact of those sell-down activities are. So just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace, we have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency. And for the long-term benefit of the franchise, we very much hope that we'll remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients to exit those positions in advance of a potential refinancing would be to surrender our incumbency position. And so we're being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the third-party fund management business while supporting clients in the process. Devin Ryan : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So you highlighted in the prepared remarks that Goldman surpassed your fundraising target in alternatives. And so as we look forward, can you give some more color on your strategy to grow, particularly in private credit? Any update on how big you expect to get in private credit, how it complements your DCM and wealth franchises, and maybe any risks that we should be thinking about would be helpful? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure. Appreciate the question. It's, obviously, something, Ryan, we're very, very focused on. We feel good about the fundraising progress we've made. I think when you look forward in 2024, you could expect us to raise another $40 billion to $50 billion of alternatives. We're, obviously, very focused on private credit. We do operate at scale on private credit. We have over $110 billion of private credit. But I think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale on private credit, especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage. So we're going to continue to keep this focus. It doesn't stop because we met our goal. Our goal was meant to flame the opportunity set three-and-a-half years ago, but you'll see us continue to raise money on a year-to-year basis. And we've got some big funds that we're going to be in the market with in 2024, and we'll continue to build the partnerships with that client base. And both myself, John Waldron, and the broad team across our Asset Management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships. Ryan Kenny : And then Basel endgame comment letters are due today. So now that you and other GSIBs have had time to digest the proposal, could you give us an update on how Goldman might plan to adapt if the potential final rule comes through and how the proposal is written might impact your 15% to 17% through the cycle RoTCE target? Denis Coleman : Sure. Well, obviously, today marks the end of the comment period, and what I would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. In fact, I would say, it's the end of the beginning of the process. And so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our significant concern with the proposed rules. You'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. You'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could affect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business. And I think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry, and also I think disadvantages the US from a competitive perspective. So to be clear, my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. I don't think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed, I think there's a pretty significant view out there that the Fed is listening carefully, they're taking in the feedback, and I don't think there's anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. We're very flexible with our capital, as I've said before. If the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity to adapt. I think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature. But we've got a lot of capital flexibility and we've proven over time we can be particularly nimble. And so we'll continue to focus. Ryan Kenny : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. As you think about your efficiency targets, what's a reasonable level of growth for non-comp expenses as we, excluding, obviously, all the one-timers this year? And maybe what the areas of investment are or priorities when you think about 2024? Denis Coleman : Thanks, Dan. So the efficiency ratio is something we are laser focused on. We continue to orient the firm to drive towards our 60% target. You mentioned the impact of selected items. If you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efficiency ratio would have been more like 65%. That's, obviously, not where we want it to be, but significantly better than the fully reported number. We have a number of initiatives across the firm to get after our non-compensation expense. We had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efficiency targets at the end of last year, rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year. There is a -- we have a ton of different categories. We're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non-compensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing KPIs, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efficiently as possible. We do see an impact of inflation across these activities, and it's for that reason, that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. I think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure round selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat, and we'll be very, very -- remain very, very focused on maintaining our overall non-comp expense spend. And the other component of the efficiency ratio is, obviously, compensation expense. You saw that over the course of this year, we maintained our pay for performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024, that is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. There are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. Our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses, are variable. So we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to, ultimately, determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efficiency ratio. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. And follow-up on Wealth Management, you disclosed 40% of the alternative inflows since 2019 have come from the wealth channel. Curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether you view that level of contribution as sustainable. And also just the economics to Goldman Sachs, how it differs between that 40% in wealth and the 60% externally. How does that -- what's the difference in revenue? David Solomon : Well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past four years that we've grown our Asset Management business -- Asset & Wealth Management business, and it highlights in the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. When you look at our strategy, Dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than 40% from private wealth. So as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community, the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease, but I'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. At scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. They're attractive in the private wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. But as I think you all know, they're not exactly identical. And people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion definitely have a different economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. And that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. So we're continuing to scale the business. We have real margin targets in the business. I think we've got lots of opportunities and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of Goldman Sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the benefit of our scaled Asset & Wealth Management platform. And I'm confident we'll continue to make good progress. Daniel Fannon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. There's, obviously, all the uncertainty on the capital rules as was discussed earlier. But just in the near-term, how do you think about capital allocation? You're, obviously, continuing to lean into financing, which is capital-intensive, depending on how banking, and if banking comes back, that can consume capital. And then just touch on interest in bolt-on deals, and then obviously, anything on buybacks, which were pretty solid in '23. Thank you. David Solomon : I'll start, and Denis, might add some comments. We've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. We've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise -- our client franchises over the course of the last five years. And I think one of the reasons why our big broad Global Banking & Markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in different environments the way it's performed is we've been very, very focused on making sure we have the capital and the financial resources to serve our client base well. Where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there. That's in our broad capital planning program. We do generate a lot of capital from earnings. And to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. At the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around Basel III endgame. Although again, I think that's going to continue to evolve. And I also think we have a long track record of being very, very nimble with our ability to deploy. So we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. And as we generate capital, we have confidence in our capital position that we'll return capital to shareholders. And we've been very focused, as you've seen, on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that. Matt O'Connor: And then just separately following up on the exit of legacy on-balance sheet principal investment, is there an expense reduction opportunity as those investments and some of the infrastructure goes away over time? David Solomon : There is an operating leverage story, which is one of the reasons why the margin in our Asset & Wealth Management business will continue to improve. When we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on-balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions, creates a business that's scaled differently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. And so we're early in the journey. I'll just give a simple example. We went out last year, a year-and-a-half ago, and raised our first growth equity fund. We used to do that business on-balance sheet. We have lots and lots of positions, and therefore, a very, very broad team to service that. We raised our first fund. You need a smaller team to manage that fund. But when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. And so there's real operating leverage in that, and that's part of our margin improvement story in Asset & Wealth Management over time. So the answer is, yes. I don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story, but it is a place where we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, David. Good morning, Dennis. Denis Coleman : Good morning David Solomon : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. In your prepared remarks, David, you were talking about, I think it was slide five or six, but about the success in growing the relationships with those top 100 FICC and equity clients, and you identified that the FICC and equity financing contributed to that success. And that's been a real hallmark for you guys over the last two or three years, the growth in that business. Can you dig down for us and share with us what has attributed to the success? Is it the capital you put into that business, the hiring of additional folks or people in the business, and as well as competition. Has the competition been more challenged than some of your competitors at all? Credit Suisse, of course, is no longer around. But if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that success? David Solomon : Sure, Gerard. At a high level, I'd point to a couple of things. But I'd start with the fact that that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of firm that really does operate those businesses at scale. And I think that's just important as a baseline. But I think there are a handful of things that we've done well. First, One GS and our One GS Ethos. If you go back historically, we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience. And clients would come into the firm in different places and get different experiences. And we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really, thinking about how do these clients experience the firm? And we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. They really wanted to deal with the firm as a partner, one partner. I think we've made through One GS and that ethos, real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. And because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. Secondarily, we've become a much bigger financer of their activities. And when you finance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. And number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view, a very long-term approach to transacting with them. They need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive. We want to be there. If you do that, you do that consistently, you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. And so I think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us. When we look at our wallet shares, we continue to spend a lot of time. John and I spend a lot of time, and Denis, too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. And as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. And as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our One GS operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. It's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then I know you've talked about the pipelines and your comments about what we might be able to see in ECM and other areas this year. Can you also give us a little flavor on what parts of the -- since you're obviously a global force, what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential? Is it the Americas, is it Europe, or is it Asia? David Solomon : Well, it's scale. The Americas is the biggest part of the activity level. And just given the resilience of the US economy, I think you've seen a material pick up there, proportionally that's broader than other places. But we are seeing more activity across Europe, particularly strategic dialogue. I'd say, the one place where things are slower, obviously, is in Asia with respect to China. And just given the nature of economic activity there, where things are positioned, that still seems slower, both on both the M&A side and the capital market side. But those are comments that make it a high-level, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Always appreciate the insights. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Thanks. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. So I wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins. And maybe just to start off, Denis, you noted the adjusted efficiency ratio set at 65% versus the reported figure in the mid-70s. When we try to adjust for various items, at least in the public disclosure, it looks like the core adjusted efficiency somewhere in the upper 60s. And I was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the different items to get down to that 65% figure and whether that's the appropriate jumping off point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to '24? Denis Coleman : So, Steven, I'd say, I think the 65% is a good jumping off point for 2024. And as the business evolves from there, as I indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the firm. Certain of our activities attract different degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. And so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. We'll have to be mindful, obviously, what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. I think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Our revenues net of PCL in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly flat. We observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of significant execution activity, and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. In terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-off FDIC special assessment. The one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on CIEs as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed. Steven Chubak : That's great. And just for a follow-up relating to the comments you just made, Denis, on comp leverage, specifically. It looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about $4 billion this year for The Street. The comp dollars are expected to increase only about $600 million. You do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins. But I just wanted to get a sense, given you were alluding to the fact that you're going to pay for talent and you're going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform, how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage, is an 85% comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from? Denis Coleman : Steven, I'll make a comment. David wants to make another one as well. We're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. We're also focused on driving scale across the platform. And meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. It's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. The ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders. Steven Chubak : Great. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Denis Coleman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. I was just wondering what you're going to do about the Lead Independent Director, who I guess is no longer on your Board, Bayo, I guess, his firm got purchased and now you need to get a new lead director. Is that someone from the Board currently, someone from outside Goldman Sachs, what type of person is the Board looking for? David Solomon : So I appreciate the question, Mike. As you highlight, at the end of last week, Bayo sold his business to BlackRock. Bayo still is the Lead Director. That deal won't close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter. Bayo is the Lead Director. We have a governance process in place. Our Board has met and at the appropriate time, we'll make announcement as to the transition. But at this point, other than the fact that because of the sale, it will create a transition. I have nothing more to say other than Bayo is still the Lead Director, and we'll manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises. Mike Mayo : Okay. So what? You would consider people outside of Goldman Sachs currently for that or? David Solomon : Well, we're always adding people to our Board, Mike. But I'm not going to make comments. I'm not going to make forward comments about our governance process and our Board looks at this at the time that the Board takes action. We announced a clear transition. I'll be happy to answer questions and talk about it. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, April 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference. David Solomon : Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter. As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the first few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. In Wealth Management, we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In Alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difficult fundraising environment. And in Solutions, we continued -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA offerings. These are all areas in which we still see significant opportunities and we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win. I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, Artificial Intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is an enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulations, impact on jobs, and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. Today, we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer-term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be significant demand for AI-related infrastructure and as a result, financing, which will be a tailwind to our business. For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We are focused on enhancing productivity, particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efficiency while maintaining a high bar for quality, security, and controls. Like with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. Turning to the macro-environment, we continue to be constructive on the health of the US economy. The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I am also mindful that US equity markets are hovering near-record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inflation, the commercial real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. But that said, the US economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So, while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. Nonetheless, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $11.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%. We provide details on the financial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter. Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the first quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. Turning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. We remain number one in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose significantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower financing spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year. Record management and other fees were up 7% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year, which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. We had $24 billion of long-term net inflows, largely in fixed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to Page 7, on Alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter. We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year. More broadly, we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next five years. On-balance sheet Alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the first quarter, we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. We expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026 consistent with our target. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment profitability has improved with a pre-tax net loss of $117 million for the quarter. In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pre-tax breakeven next year. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter, as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. Turning to Page 10. We continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know, we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reflecting improved operating performance for the firm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year, even inclusive of a $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% and for the full year, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. Now on to Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with a 170 basis point buffer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for significant modifications to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment. We also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & Wealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January, which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. It's a tough one because you are definitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out. And of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. I noticed your lower pipeline. But the real question I have is, the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. Comp was up with that normally, but non-comp is down, the provision is down and RWA didn't increase even though you were growing your financing. So I'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what of that package can continue to stick? David Solomon : Well, I appreciate it, Glenn. And I think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package. We've made significant progress over the course of the last five years. Certainly, building our financing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. We still think there's lots of room to grow. And look, the world is growing and when the world grows and our clients grow, they need us to finance them. We've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base. And so we stay focused on that. We've doubled our management fees on our Asset & Wealth Management business over the last five years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. Those are more durable revenues. And there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. You've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. Overall, I think, we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very, very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. And we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? I think the wallet shares are. What I can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well-positioned. And we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate all that. Can we talk just follow up on just the non-comp piece and talk -- you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuff. So are those at actually run-rate levels now going forward also because that was a nice positive surprise? Denis Coleman : Good morning, Glenn. It's Dennis. As we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very, very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. There clearly are inflationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non-comp expense. The sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. And so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very, very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. But I think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up, David. You mentioned AI and would love this -- it's hard in our seats to figure out what's hype, what's real. If you can double-click on some of the comments you made around comparing what's going on with AI today versus maybe the dotcom bubble around the runway this might create for capital markets, IB, not just for this year, but beyond? And then also the other side around, is there line-of-sight of how much more efficient Goldman itself can get by deploying AI? Thank you. David Solomon : Sure. So, I mean, big picture and look, I'm not a stock picker, so I'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the Internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001, I'm not going to comment around that. I think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that I think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. But broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power, and these things require financing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. And that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. So I actually think there's a very, very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is -- that is candidly unprecedented. And so I think that opportunity is something over the course, this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next five to 10 years and we're very, very focused on it and very engaged. And by the way, it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locale. And so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. Double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on Goldman Sachs, I would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency. Our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. But I'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes very cost accretive. I think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity, and also when we look at our datasets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be differentiated. And so we're very focused on the productivity side, although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's good color. Thank you. And just separately, for the Goldman stock, right, I think from an investor standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of Asset Management. You've talked about the HPIs coming down, alt assets going up. Is -- how else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the Asset Management revenues and is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today? Thank you. David Solomon : So we -- in January, we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. We're executing on that. We are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. Firm obviously generates a lot of capital. There could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. But at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress. But I think we put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top-line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise, you saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in Alternatives in the first quarter. We said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year. Obviously, the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. That doesn't stop this year. We think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. So we're focused on the things that matter in Asset Management. What matters? Performance matters, client experience matters. We're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very -- very effectively. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Christian Bolu : Good morning, guys. Maybe I'll ask Glenn's question in a different way. If I look at that 18% ROE for the Global Bank and the Markets business, it really -- it really catches my eye here. So how would you characterize this quarter's performance? Is it like sort of normal-ish to you? Does it feel maybe peak-ish to you? Again just trying to figure out if 18% ROE is anywhere sustainable for that business. David Solomon : That was -- it was a -- it was -- there's no way to shade this. It was a strong quarter for Global Banking and Markets. Peak, I mean, I can point in the last few years to quarters in Global Banking and Markets where the returns were higher. But I certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in Global Banking and Markets. We've said clearly, we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. The performance this quarter was higher. There were performance last year was meaningfully lower. I think the right thing to focus on, Christian, is mid-teens through the cycle. That's the way we think about it. And there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and I think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. We're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. And then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at the past. But I would view this as a very strong quarter on Global Banking and Markets and not what we would target as the average run-rate for the business. Christian Bolu : Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe on to private wealth, if I'm reading Slide 9 correctly, you had something like $17 billion of inflows into Wealth Management AUS. So that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which is well above peers, I would call it best-in-class. So can you give more color on what's driving that growth? Maybe any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? And again, longer-term, how are you thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth? David Solomon : Yes. Again, this I think comes down to focus and you know we made some very -- we talked about conscious decisions. We have talked about broadening our Wealth platform to get much more broadly into what I'd call kind of high net-worth Wealth Management. And with the sale of United Capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra-high net-worth platform. It is an extraordinary platform. I do think it's a best-in-class platform. I do think that the ultra-high net-worth business is still a very fragmented business. While we have leading share, I think those shares are still on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. There's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot of wealth accumulating. But we are very, very well-positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. And I think the business is performing very, very well. So, our alts franchise, I think is differentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. I think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. We're expanding our private banking activity. That's not something that we have been focused on, which I think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager. So, I think there's a good runway for this business. I do think it's a best-in-class franchise that has room to grow. And I think you're seeing it perform well and we're very focused on it. I think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, I think we're benefiting from at the moment. Christian Bolu : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? David Solomon : Good morning, Betsy. Denis Coleman : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Great. Just want to make sure. David Solomon : We can hear you fine. Thank you. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks. So, just two follow-ups. One, I heard all the commentary about how the 1Q is run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time. But it doesn't take away from the fact that 1Q was very strong. And I just wanted to understand, was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and fixed income, for example, that were different this quarter? And the reason I ask is, VaR efficiency was so strong, right? You've delivered very strong trading revenues on VaR that was, you know, basically flat Q-on-Q. I mean, a little down, a little up, depending on which asset -- which asset class you're looking at. So, was there anything in the -- in -- when you mentioned, you stepped into client activity and opportunity set, was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didn't really tag VaR at all? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, Betsy, it's Denis. Nice to hear from you. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Denis Coleman : Look, to give you some color on that, I wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. I would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. But in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. And I would observe that over the course of the quarter, it was just a very benign operating environment. Credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our Global Banking and Markets business as well. The first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. So we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. And as David said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter, particularly in FICC and Equities. So, when we talk about like a Global Banking and Markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both FICC and Equities in Q1. Betsy Graseck : Super. That's really helpful. Thanks for the incremental color there. Just one other follow-up. David, you mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the Wealth platform that you've got. Could you just give us a little more color as to what you're thinking about there that we should understand? Thanks so much. David Solomon : Sure. I think one of the things that our Wealth Management franchise finds very attractive is, we want an open platform. And so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very, very broad, very, very deep, very, very unique offering as one of the top five or six alts providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what we're manufacturing out of our Asset Management business. But in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. And so I think that's a very, very unique offering that very, very affluent people who wealth manage at Goldman Sachs find super attractive and super differentiated. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask one on your M&A franchise. So the recovery in announced M&A has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategic, and given your strong franchise among sponsors, I'm curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side. David Solomon : Yes. Brennan, that's -- I appreciate that question. And that's a sharp observation on your part. The sponsor activity is still muted, but I would say it's definitely picking up. The engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. And as I've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. And the level of activity has been incredibly muted. And when you look at the LP community, the LP community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. I'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout 2023. But I would say it's still operating at lower levels. There's a lot of upside for our business. Our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity. And so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly. When I look at our leveraged finance deals book, it's still operating at historically very, very low levels. We feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital flexibility. That was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. We're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but I think it's coming. And certainly, the sustained level we've had over the -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. It will pick up. It's just a question of when. And so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks. Thanks for that color, David. I appreciate it. And then another question on alts. So, fundraising looks really good. I know there can be some noise in the revenue. So, just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the AUS only up sort of marginally sequentially. Could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise? Denis Coleman : Sure. Brennan, it's Denis. So, a couple of things. Obviously, the movement in AUS is a function of how we fundraise, how we deploy, and overall levels. We have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265 billion-plus since the original Investor Day. But there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into AUS. Not all of our funds that are raised are AUS-ing immediately. So I think that is something you can look out for in future periods. And then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as David was walking through our platform, our Wealth platform in terms of having Goldman Sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, and third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform, and if we look over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. David, you reiterated the desire for Goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for GreenSky, the GM Card, Platform Solutions still lost $117 million. So I'm just trying to figure out in this context where transaction banking stands. I mean, you had 8% year-over-year growth. So, that's decent. But three years ago, March 1st, you guys said transaction banking, you're building global payments around the world. And then March 8th of this year on Bloomberg, it says that you're closed in Japan and now you're focusing on the US and Europe. So on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions? On the other hand, maybe you have more financial discipline. You're making sure these adjacent activities are generating profits instead of just growth. David Solomon : Look, Mike, I think you summarized it well. I think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. We're looking hard -- we are -- I think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. We think we've got very, very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. But there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that it's not just top-line growth that it delivers profitability. It's something that sits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. I think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately. And so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. And I think this is a medium and longer-term project that we will deliver on. It's small, but I think we've got the right focus. We made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy. And with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and cleanup. The after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million. We've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or profitability in 2025 and we're executing against that. Mike Mayo : Just to follow up on the transaction banking. You said some ambitions were too broad. Again, it's better to have profitable growth than just growth. So, point acknowledged. But what happened? I mean, where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the build-out costs or what was more difficult than you had anticipated? David Solomon : Well, I think there were a number of things, Mike, that came together. I think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. And I think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. And so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. That doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now, that's the right action. I'd say secondarily, the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds in a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. And so that's something else that went into the mix. And so look, I think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say, okay, this isn't exactly right. So we're going to adjust. And I think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders, driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. We'll get some things right, we'll get some things wrong. But when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So, wanted to follow up, David, on -- Denis Coleman : Good morning. David Solomon : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Good morning, guys. Wanted to follow up, David, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity. Private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. Just wanted to better understand what you're seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting your IB&O franchises. And just given some of the recent price coverage, maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly. David Solomon : Sure. I'm going to -- I'll make a couple of comments, but I'm going to ask Denis to comment too because as you know, Denis -- Denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. But I'd just say first, the narrative that in some way, shape or form, this is -- this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, I think is an oversimplification. As transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community, the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully. We're very well-positioned for that. We are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. But that's going to continue to be a very, very important part of capital formation and it's not going away. The growth in private credit will continue. I think we're very well-positioned for that. We have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. I've said publicly, we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow, and we see a number of places where we can do that. We're very focused on that. I do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. And so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. But I think strategically, we're in a very, very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. And you can see that. I mean, I can point to a transaction that was done in the last -- in the last few months we did just that. And in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too, you can look at the Endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender, but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of the way that I think that our franchise and our platform is differentiated. Denis, do you want to add anything to those comments? Denis Coleman : Sure. I think it's well-covered. I mean, I think there was -- there's been a lot of discussion over the past of the -- past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is, the syndicated alternative didn't really exist. And so it was really just a discussion around private credit. With first quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning, and healthy syndicated loan market. The vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing. A lot of that refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. So the reality is, these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers. And over time, I think there'll be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. And I think we're just in a healthier environment, but from Goldman Sachs' perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leverage lending market make sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity. So, I think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for Goldman Sachs. Steven Chubak : Really helpful color. And for my follow-up, just on capital management. CET1 continues to build, you're well in excess of the regulatory minimums, the direction of travel on Basel III in terms of expectations around the proposal is certainly more favorable. At the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the SLR, which declined to 5.4%. I know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but I was hoping you could just speak to how you're managing to leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment, and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, yes, you're right on all counts. Obviously, we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. The SLR is a slower-moving ratio as you know, but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. And we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. But I appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Devin Ryan : Great. Thanks so much. The first question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in Markets. I know this has really been ongoing work for the firm and obviously, not just the quarter, but really the past few years, this has been pretty consistent story. So, if we kind of move aside financing, love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in Equities and FICC and where you're most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years and then still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there. Thanks. David Solomon : Well, at a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and I think we got right over a period of time, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in this business. The top 150 clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise. And so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. I think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. And so it's something we're very focused on. There are times when there's more activity in commodities, there's time when there's more activity in credit, there's time when there's more activity in mortgages. It moves and it ebbs and flows, but what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. I think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, I think we stand at slightly under top three with 117 of them, don't hold me to that number exactly. It's probably, okay, 117 of them. So, obviously, we have progress to make because there's no reason why Goldman Sachs shouldn't be top three with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. And also when you look at top three, there are also clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be first or second. And so we continue to drill down. We continue to go, talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. And that discipline and that rigor, I think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do and we don't take our position for granted. We try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute both. Devin Ryan : Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks, David. Maybe a quick follow-up here for Denis. Just on the equity investments line, not a great quarter there, not a drag either. It feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes. And so just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? And then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment. Obviously, it's been tough there as well. Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks for the question. So, a couple of things, and may have been embedded in your question. But obviously looking at some of the -- on the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis. Just a reminder that in Q4 when we sold Personal Financial Management, that was reflected as a gain in equity investments of about $350 million that did not repeat. So that will give you some -- some insight into how that's trending sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio, sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. And what we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. We also, as you know, have been -- have focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. So a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute -- contribute to the ultimate performance. The other guidance that we've put out there generally, medium-term guidance is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year. So you could put that in the quarter, about $500 million. Those are some pieces of color I'd give you. Operator : We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Actually, just to follow up on the last question and comment, the run-off of the historical principal investment from the $15 billion here, the $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the run-off that you expect, or was that alluding to the revenues per year? Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks. Let me clarify. I was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio, I guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one. The progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year. And then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target. Matt O'Connor: Okay. So $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year? Denis Coleman : On the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year. Operator : We'll go next to Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about your financing business in Markets. And obviously, there's uncertainty about the Basel end-game proposal. As you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. But one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities financing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. And if that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your financing revenues? Is it a threat? Is it not a big deal? Can you offset it through pricing, product design? Just curious if you can provide a little color on that. Denis Coleman : Sure. So, obviously, where Basel III ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. But I'd say the breadth of our financing activities across both FICC and Equity are much broader than that particular component. And we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both FICC and Equities will remain high. We have leading market shares and capabilities there. So we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. And depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need, either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients. Saul Martinez : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on Basel and the implications of it being softened, Denis, you mentioned more flexibility on capital deployment, if given the direction of travel on Basel. I mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? You did $1.5 billion. Is there -- do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings? Denis Coleman : Sure. I appreciate the question. We were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that David said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy, which starts with our client franchise. And some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. And so we have a good amount of cushion and flexibility at this point in time. As our clients become more active, the first place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. And after that, we would, of course, as you note, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. And only after that would we think about return of capital. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs' first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

David Solomon : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. We are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country. There is no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society. Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first-half of the year. We continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announcement completed M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A recovery. And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity. We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FIC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and financing needs. We continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 118 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees in private, banking, and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter. Our Assets Under Supervision had a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a 23% margin for the first-half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM. In alternatives, we raised $36 billion a year-to-date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies. Given the stronger-than-anticipated fundraising in the first-half of the year, as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset growth management platform. Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there is a high level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policy. And inflation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand the environment in the U.S. remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs. I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon Valley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it significant demand-related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise. Before I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests. Given this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter. We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our confidence in the durability of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit in the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public company. We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm, and it's been an eventful 25-years since then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dotcom bubble, NASDAQ crash, September 11th, the financial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame these challenges, immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people. In closing, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results in more detail. Dennis Coleman : Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 11.6%. Now turning to performance by segment starting on page four. Global banking and markets produce revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. No volumes remain well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leverage finance activity. We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Our backlog rose significantly quarter-on-quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FIC net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies. FIC financing revenues were $850 million, a near record, and up 37% year-over-year. Equity's net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter up 7% year-on-year as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives. Equity's financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially. Taken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2 billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first-half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FIC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base. I'm moving to asset wealth management on page five. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year-over-year. As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707million. Our premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products. A great example of the power of this unique platform. We expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the first-half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium term target. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by $31 billion of long-term net inflows, largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $548 million in management and other fees. Rose third-party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the first-half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion. On page nine, firmwide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non-interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115 million related to our wholesale portfolio. Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first-half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full-year, we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on slide 11. In the quarter we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirement, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter. We will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement. Our board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise. In conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first-half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record first-half revenues across FIC and equities financing, management and other fees, and private banking and lending. We remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Please stand by as we assemble the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi there. Thanks very much. So I liked your forward leaning comments on the IBC pipeline and I think I heard you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high. Does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inflection point in private equity related M&A, sponsor related M&A? And then how much of an [Technical Difficulty] think you have as being maybe the big -- the only big bank that has a full on private credit platform, obviously DCM platform and lending platform? Thank you. David Solomon : Sure, good morning Glenn, and thanks for the question. You know, we're forward leaning in our comments, because we definitely see momentum pick up. But I just, again, want to highlight something that was definitely my part of the script. And I think Dennis amplified, which were still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10-year averages. And so for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on M&A. One of the reasons that M&A activity, one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so I think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity. We're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. And obviously, it's been way, way below the overall M&A activity as kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that and we're starting to see that increase. Now, as that increases, I just think the firm's incredibly well positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. We've been top kind of one, two, three in what I'll call leverage-financed activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private credit platform. And so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position. The size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds, you know, to their limited partners, I think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last two, 2.5 years. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? Can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? Thanks. Dennis Coleman : Sure, Glenn. It's Dennis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. And the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So that is, I think, a large explain of the delta. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I just wanted to spend some time on capital, the post, the SCB increase. One, maybe just from a business standpoint, if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the firm has been leaning into the financing business. Do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? So one, how does it impact the business? And second, Dennis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1Q levels of buybacks going forward? Thanks. Dennis Coleman : Sure, Ibrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess first important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. So we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise. And with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing as David was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses. We have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. Given the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. So assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the financing business. And just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity, we waited all year for things to pick up. Is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? Does it speak to inflated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? Just would love any context there, David, if you could? Thank you. David Solomon : Sure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point, there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. And as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. But I just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. I'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to go back to more normalized levels. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. David Solomon : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, can you hear me okay? Oh, okay. Sorry, [Multiple Speakers] All right. Well, thanks very much. I did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because, we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but I'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? Or is this just a one-off given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call? David Solomon : Sure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves. Betsy Graseck : Okay and as we anticipate a continued pick up here in M&A, given everything you mentioned earlier, I would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way. Would you agree with that or do I have something wrong there? Thanks. Dennis Coleman : No, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. And we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged, Dennis, the record financing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. And it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reflect balance growth. So one, I want to confirm that that's fair? And could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon? Dennis Coleman : Sure. Thank you, Brendan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. We have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products. The business is very diversified by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. That's something that we're going to remain mindful of. But we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then next question is really sort of a follow on from Betsy's line of questioning. So year-to-date you've got a 64% efficiency ratio. You know, when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment, consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily, you know, how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? You know, could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efficiency ratio? Dennis Coleman : Sure. So, thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously, our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency. But ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that. And we do have a very granular process internally, looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. I'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. I mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. You have record financing for equities and FIC combined. You're number one in M&A. You have record management fees and record assets under supervision. Your efficiency has gone from 74% to 64%. Increase your dividend by 9% to signal your confidence, your CET1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher Fed requirements. David, you start off the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 11% ROE in the second quarter, that's not quite the 15% where you want it to be. So where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? Thanks. David Solomon : Yes, thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey. And, you know, the way I look at it, our returns for the first-half of the year at 12.8%. There are, you know, I think there are a couple of things, give gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through. And so that will come out. And at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the first-half of the year would be a little higher exit. And then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I obviously can't predict. But if you look at the returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm. And we're going to continue to focus on that. Now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the AWM, ROE is not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've gotten the margin up to 23%, but the ROE is still around 10%. We think we can continue to grow the business. As we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM, ROE. And then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile. So I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not worked to do for sure. But we feel good about the progress. Mike Mayo : And I assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in. Can you just describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on pass cycles? David Solomon : What I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously, if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. But as a general matter, when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance sheets. They need to manage risks through structured transactions. And so there's a multiplier effect as those activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the M&A side. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, for your returns, the denominator is a big factor. How does that work with the Fed? I know you can't say too much and regional people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the Fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. So how does this process work from here? Will we hear results about the SEB ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors? David Solomon : Look, as a general matter, what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. However, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks transparency. It contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect the significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year-over-year. Now, despite all that, you know, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital flexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But obviously we have more work to do given this result. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question. Just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. They were down only modestly despite the absence of the Green Sky contribution. Just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look at the next quarter? Dennis Coleman : So, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the Green Sky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted. Steven Chubak : Understood and maybe just one more clarifying question. I know there's been a lot asked about the SEB. Really just wanted to better understand, Dennis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal. Just how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to Basel III endgame. There's certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? But just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the SEB and Basel III endgame, where you're comfortable running on a CET1 basis over the near to medium term? Dennis Coleman : Sure, thanks and I appreciate that question. I think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal flexibility. And certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to Basel III endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution. It sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to support clients return capital shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input. Steven Chubak : Helpful color. Thanks for taking my questions. Dennis Coleman : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Devin Ryan : All right, great. Good morning, David and Dennis. A couple questions on AWM progress. So the first one is on the alts business specifically, and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium term target for annual incentive fees? And now with over $500 billion in alts AUM and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative. So I appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in AUM there? Dennis Coleman : So Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective. We do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously you know bounce around from time-to-time it is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. So I think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know, should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures. Devin Ryan : Yes, okay, thanks, Dennis. And then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin profile of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35% plus for alts and some of the public firms we know are obviously well above that. So I appreciate you're running the AWM segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts AUM isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in \u201824. So just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well? Dennis Coleman : So that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us, because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall AWM margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy. And so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution. Devin Ryan : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks, good morning. In terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about? Dennis Coleman : Sure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year. But our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year. Dan Fannon : Understood. And as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. The private credit fund closing here in the first-half was big. Can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year? Dennis Coleman : Sure. So, you know, obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know, once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the first-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year. And I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure. We had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter, but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape specifically in banking and markets. I know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know, are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago. And all these regional banks that I cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. So you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. And I'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point? David Solomon : Sure, Matt, and I appreciate the question. I just say, you know, investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at. There's always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading M&A share for 25-years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. An then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk I think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time. And so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and financial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions is very well. They'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business. Matt O'Connor: Okay helpful, it's unagreed. And then just separately, I hate to ask you about activity levels and stuff like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe I'll frame it. From your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? Do they kind of say, well, let's wait and see the other side? Is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? Thank you. David Solomon : There are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but I think we're well positioned to serve our clients, regardless of the environment. And clients are very active at the moment, and I think they're probably going to continue to be active. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Dennis. David, you said in your opening comments that you took the board out to Silicon Valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for Goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that? Can you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing within Goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efficient? David Solomon : Sure, I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service firm, a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very, very powerful tool. So, you know we you know if you look and you think across the scale of our business I think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. You can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter. You're all analysts on the phone. There's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what I'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there. When you look at the data sets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. For our engineering stack and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful. So those are a handful. There are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But again, I'd step back. Well, this will increase our productivity. The thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. And that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. People will need to make investment, they'll need financing, they'll need to scale. And so we're excited about that broad opportunity. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, Dennis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? It seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book? Dennis Coleman : Sure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, the charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. So while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. And although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on capital, I mean, it certainly is encouraging that your CET1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- I think, a $16 billion reduction in RWA as your presentation talks about credit RWA is falling this quarter? I guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? And I guess more importantly, is there continued room for RWA optimization from here to help manage your capital levels? Dennis Coleman : Sure, thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions both in credit and market risk RWAs. Drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower levels of volatility. We try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. So that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed. And it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under. Saul Martinez : Thank you, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up on financing, FIC financing up 37% equities, the equity financing, now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. I guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know, to continue to grow from here? How much more space is there, you know, to use finding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients? Dennis Coleman : That's a good question, Saul. I think on the FIC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And you know, we think based on what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunities that across the client portfolio. So we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business. In equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. And clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both FIC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow. Saul Martinez : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time there are no additional questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, October 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference. David Solomon : Thank you, operator, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40 an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%. Overall, I am pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises where we were effectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. Global Banking and Markets, we remained premier M&A advisor and a leading global risk intermediary. Across investment banking, corporate and sponsors remained actively engaged and we see significant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchises to benefit from the continued resurgence in activity. In FIC, we delivered record financing revenues and facilitated our clients\u2019 risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter. And in equities, we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and financing. Overall, our global broad e-platform remained exceptionally well positioned to support our clients\u2019 evolving needs across products and asset classes. In the Asset and Wealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager the top five alternatives player and a premier ultra-high network franchise afford us significant opportunities in secular growth areas. Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing $3 trillion, and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. We demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year. We remain confident in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single digit pace over the coming years, and alternatives fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity, secondaries, and infrastructure. Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra-high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading offerings and our lending offerings to clients. Our pre-tax margin and AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid-20s target. We remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business, while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions. As I look at the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Inflation has been coming down, the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we have seen some softness in consumer behavior, the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructed. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity. More broadly, clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world. The policy implications of global elections, particularly in the U.S. and the high levels of geopolitical instability. Against this backdrop are leading global franchises in supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes. Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III revision. Although, we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory officials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR and the G-SIB buffer. We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time, but as we've said before, we need to get this right. The final rule have a significant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small, and will impact growth across the country. We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period. We remain very engaged both as an industry and as a firm. In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. We are leaning into our strengths. Our client franchise is stronger than ever, and we continue to harness our one Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class talent, execution capabilities, and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a firm and allow us to provide differentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $8.40 up 54% year-over-year. ROE was 10.4% and ROTE of 11.1%. As David mentioned, our results were impacted by select items, including agreements to transition the GM card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller financing norms. In aggregate, these items reduced EPS by $0.62 and our ROE by 80 basis points. Now turning to performance by segment starting on Page 4. Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $875 million were up both sequentially and versus the prior year period. We remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed M&A for the year to date. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year over year to $385 million. As equity capital markets have continued to reopen, though volumes are still well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 46% year over year to 605 million amid higher leverage finance and investment grade activity. We are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Overall, our investment banking backlog rose quarter on quarter driven by advisory. FIC net revenues of $3 billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year amid a relatively quieter summer, though we saw a meaningful pickup in activity in September. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record FIC financing revenues of $949 million, which rose 30% year over year, primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion dollars in the quarter up 18% versus the prior year. Equities intermediation revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash products. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average balances. Across FIC and equities financing revenues were a record $6.6 billion for the year to date. A direct result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base. Moving to Asset and Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 16% year over year. Our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.4 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.6 billion for the quarter and $7.6 billion for the year to-date well on the way to achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024. Private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to 756 million. We are seeing positive momentum in this business, and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product offerings. Incentive fees for the quarter were $85 million. We continue to expect to reach our annual target of $1 billion over the medium term, supported by approximately $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter. Equity and debt investments revenues totaled $294 million reflecting NII in our debt portfolio and markups in our public equity portfolio. For the year to date, we generated one and a half billion in combined equity and debt investments revenues. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $3.1 trillion, bolstered by $37 billion of liquidity products net inflows, and $29 billion of long-term net inflows across asset classes. We continue to see traction in our solutions business where we are leveraging our SMA capabilities and outsource CIO platform to deliver customized multi-asset solutions. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $328 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $527 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $16 billion in the third quarter and over $50 billion for the year-to-date. This brings cumulative third-party fundraising to more than $300 billion since our Investor Day in 2020. We further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.7 billion in the third quarter to $10.9 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $5.4 billion. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $2.6 billion in the quarter up versus the prior year period, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $192 billion up year-over-year, driven by an increase in other collateralized lending. For the third quarter, our provision for credit losses was $397 million, primarily driven by net charge offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by $70 million of net recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.3 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.2 billion down 14% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the firm, given ongoing inflationary pressures, competition for talent, and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6%. For the full year, we continued to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on Slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $2 billion to common shareholders, including dividends of 978 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve reduced our SEB requirement by 20 basis points to 6.2%, following a successful appeal process, resulting in a standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio requirement of 13.7%, which became effective October 1st. We remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more transparent process. Given our 90-basis point buffer, we continue to have flexibility on capital deployment and are very well positioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders. In conclusion, our overall performance reflected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating environment. We are executing on our strategy where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership positions across Global Banking and Markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Across both businesses, we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams. Simply put, we are playing to our strengths as a firm and we remain confident in our ability to drive returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So, trading question, I mean, markets business has been great, markets have been supportive. But I guess my question is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in general, and August looked like a spike in volatility, but looks like you did really well. This marks many quarters that you and others have done very well for years. Do you feel the business is managed better? Do you feel like your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side? I'm just curious on what the, if the evidence matters. David Solomon : I appreciate the question, Glenn, and I mean, it's a hard question to answer. I think we've been clear on some of the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process, but I've also been clear on regulatory environments, ebb and flow and that people can be policy. And so, overtime, you see shifts in all this. And our job, and I think we've done this effectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the different regulatory environments. With respect to the business of markets which includes FIC intermediation and FIC financing and equities intermediation and equities financing, I think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in over a long period of time. We have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of services and that's not going away. And certainly, in this environment, this is an environment that's filled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very, very active, on a broad global scale. I think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that I think have made the business more durable. Certainly, our focus and our emphasis on financing and the way we've grown and managed the financing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. But intermediation continues to be an important service, and when you really step back and you step out a quarter to quarter and you look more year to year or year over year, these are very broad franchises across numerous silos, and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quarter to quarter. So, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in it and grow it. I think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. They're correlated to market cap growth in the world. And as long as you believe, over the medium and long term, those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time, and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. How the regulators respond to that over time, I really think is a separate question. And we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. This one will be a short follow-up. With HPI was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter. I think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments. But as that book shrinks the 10.9 that's left, the 4 billion attributed to it, if I take a, should I -- is it okay to take a historical ROE on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on HPI? Denis Coleman : Glenn, its Denis. I guess what I would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments. As we continue to have success doing that, there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved off of the balance sheet. But you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our third party fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio, I don't think I have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns, but I would suggest to you that we have a very diversified portfolio of exposures and a long standing track record of delivering good returns for our clients. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just had a follow-up first on trading and maybe David would appreciate your perspective around when we read about non-bank trading venues, getting into fixed income markets, potentially sort of disrupting the business for the incumbents. Comment on that you may, you could in terms of other parallels to the equity business that we should draw? And how much of a competitive threat are the non-bank/non-regulated entities, especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the Basel game, reproposal and the opaqueness around that? Thank you. David Solomon : Yes, sure Ebrahim, and I appreciate the question. This gets a lot of attention, particularly in the press. But I think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. And look, the equities journey is a relatively good journey. There's been lots of -- first of all, there's lots of competition in all these businesses. There's always been competition, but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world, the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis. And that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients. There can always be competition and there always will be competition. I just highlight, our equity business is as large and as scaled and as profitable as ever. Even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous competition in the equity business. There's been digitization, there's been changed, there are now a handful. By handful, I'd say less than a handful. There are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces, et cetera. And will they compete and will they win business? Of course, they'll win business. But these are big, big markets. We offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider, financier of those clients, which by the way is very, very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works. While these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And just a follow-up on -- back to ROE and conversations with investors around. You have done a good job over the last year or two, performance has been strong. Stocks reflected that. As we think about the journey here from a 12%, 13% ROE to something that's maybe 15% plus, the building blocks, one could argue that the market backdrop, not the best, but not the worst. What needs to happen for Goldman to get to a point where we are registering a 15%-type ROE on a more recurring basis? Thank you. David Solomon : Well, I appreciate the question. And we've been very clear, we have a mid-teens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing towards it. I think the first thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that. And again, I think it's a pretty simple building block of a story. First, we have a Global Banking and Markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last five years of that business and the returns that, that business has delivered. I would say that I still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity, and I just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved, and we've made progress, we are still not operating at 10-year averages in M&A and equity volumes. M&A volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the first nine months of last year and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 34% to 35% that they were below 10-year averages for the first nine months last year. But there's no reason why we're not going to get back to 10-year average is a tailwind, but you can look at the performance in banking and markets, and that's one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns. The second is our continued progress, which requires more time and more execution on our part around Asset and Wealth Management. And while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns, and we continue to be very focused. But we are confident over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise into the mid-teens. The next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platform business, that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible. It's getting closer to that. And so, if you put those building blocks together, Global Banking and Markets, its actual performance with a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it benefits from continued progress on Asset and Wealth Management, that is our business, and we should be able to deliver those returns. We're focused on it. We have more work to do, but that is the path, and I think it's pretty clear. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Christian Bolu : Can you hear me? I just have a question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. How are you thinking about the -- maybe the broader competitive landscape with the -- with other banks? Your market share seemed to peak in 2022. It's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. Just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors coming back, increasing competition from anywhere. I'm just curious on your thoughts there. David Solomon : When you have leading market shares, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, you bounce around at different levels based on short-term activity, but what I'd say is if you step back and you look over the last five years, we took a step function up in our market share broadly across the plot. And so, from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see variability. But I still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on them. We're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution to the markets business. We're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there. And obviously, in a better M&A environment where there's more large cap M&A. You do see some movement in our market share. So that's a market share tailwind for us. They've always been competitive business, Christian. Again, we think we're very well positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term relationships and through our one Goldman Sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the cycle. There's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned. And I don't see anything that fundamentally changes that, but have operated in these businesses. We've operated in these businesses for a long time. There are always going to be competitive businesses. Chinedu Bolu : Okay. On Private Banking, just another set of very strong results there, I think revenue growth up 10%. And if I'm doing my math correctly, organic flows are in the high single-digit range, which would put you, I think, best in class. So just remind us again like what's driving strength there? And then maybe any key initiatives for growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth. David Solomon : Sure, I'll start. I don't know Denis might have something to add. But at a high level, this is a strategic decision that we have this big ultra-high net worth platform, and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. And there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we want a bank. And so, we really didn't look at the world that way. But lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business, and it's a very important part of the business. And we understand that we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking, and we've seen it through market that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your client, including lending, you improve your market share position. So, when you look at our wealth franchise versus under other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated the lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team on a focused effort to increase that activity to these clients. While we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like JPMorgan, and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability for our clients. And Denis I don't know if there's anything you want to add on that? Denis Coleman : The only thing I'd amplify, which I think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. So, we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them, improved our market share position with those clients. We've implemented the same thing across the GBM public businesses of FICC and equities. We stand underpenetrated relative to peers today, and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to the clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients. As David said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities and giving our advisers the confidence to offer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : The first question relates to why do you stop platform solution sets of business line? And what's happening with the Apple Card? And do you plan to exit that and take charges for that? And kind of what's going on with that? Again, two-thirds of the firm's global banking market, one-third is wealth and asset management, and then you have this kind of extra business there. David Solomon : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I mean I know there's a lot of focus on that. I think we've been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. I don't have a lot more to say about where we are with Apple Card other than we're running it and improving it. And that's really all that I have to say. But I think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear. Mike Mayo : Well, back to the core business then, you said M&A is still 13% below 10-year averages. To what degree are 10-year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity. You guys have said -- it seems like everyone has a different number, whether it's $1 trillion or $3 trillion of dry powder out there by sponsors that are ready, willing and able to pursue acquisitions. And I don't think you've ever had that level of dry powder before. So, could this be an M&A super cycle because all that money gets put to work? And if so, how would you change that 10-year average to adjust for that? David Solomon : I mean, one, I think there are long-term secular trends around M&A and market cap, which, by the way, are also meaningfully below trend I think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of large-cap M&A with the market cap expansion, especially around TAP, that might be permanent. It might not, but my guess is that will ebb and flow from time to time. But your sponsor point, Mike, is a very, very good point. And the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than I would have expected, but they will turn on. By the way, if that -- all that dry powder is deployed okay, M&A volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. But by the way, if we were sitting here five years ago, 10-year average was lower five years ago than it is today because the 10-year average is definitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth. So, I do think we'll operate a 10-year averages. I do think over time, by the end of the decade, the 10-year average will actually be higher that it's been with a historical lens. But I will say at the point lower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity. Some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we've highlighted. And I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12, 24 months. Operator : We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me okay? Okay, super. Yes, I totally agree. We've been calling for capital markets rebound. It's really nice to see it coming through. Two questions. One on the expanding loan offerings that you mentioned earlier. And I know we touched on it briefly in the Q&A. Just a few questions ago. What I wanted to make sure I understood is, when you think about the RWA impact of reducing the private investments that you're doing, you're reducing that portfolio and then increasing the expanded loan offerings into Asset & Wealth Management. Do you see that as RWA neutral is the density of the loan offerings higher or lower than the investment, the private equity investments that you've got? Denis Coleman : Sure, Betsy. Very good question. So generally speaking, the density of the HPI that we have left to sell down is high and the density asset and wealth loans is low. So, migrating RWA towards the lending businesses improves the durability, the predictability, the recurring nature of it, it brings forth the holistic access to the clients, all their wealth management needs and it is more capital efficient for us. So that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay, super. Right, because it's collateralized heavily, right? Okay. Then the other question I had was just on the GM cut. I wanted to make sure I understood this. So as far as I get it's signed but not closed yet. So, can you give us a sense as to when you think it's going to close? And are there any trailers in your P&L when it does close, for example, anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments to on the contract to GM? Or is there like a lot of cap that you have to be involved in? I'm just trying to make sure I understand how to model this as we go forward. Denis Coleman : Sure, Betsy. So, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. There has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately at closing of the platform transfer expectations we're targeting Q3 of 2025. So that's sort of timing from a modeling perspective. And I guess what I would tell you, we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform until that point in time. So, we will continue to incur call it, the run rate operating losses associated with that business. As a guide, I'd point you to where we were in Q1 and Q2 of this year, something on the order of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter, just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here until closing. Operator : We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment backlog commentary. I know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog. But we did see some sponsors recently to the IPO market with some success. And so curious about what you're seeing on the ECM and IPO side, particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel? David Solomon : So, thanks for the question, Brennan. I mean there's no question equity activity picked up. But as I highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. And IPOs running even more significantly below 10-year averages. I do think the sponsors, again, some of it is sponsor monetization. And because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher, they've been slow and they're kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. But I do see an acceleration of activity and I expect it to continue, and there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run a 10-year averages. And that those averages will grow over time with a growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsored capital. Brennan Hawken : Great. And then we've seen several partnerships and some innovation getting announced in the private credit world recently. And given your heritage in that business, how do you plan to approach and prosecute that opportunity? David Solomon : Sure. We have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one GS way, to some degree, on a differentiated way than many of the people we compete with. We obviously, as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators is not a leading position in leveraged loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that, we obviously, we originate and distribute. We also in our Asset & Management business, we are a leading player in private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that. I think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting in deploying into private credit. The valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels. And there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting origination channels and paltforms. But I would say when you look across Goldman Sachs, our origination ecosystem across both our Global Banking & Networks business and also in our Asset & Wealth Management business, is unique and differentiated and something that I think will continue to differentiate the firm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform. Operator : We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : I wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets, whether it's in consumer or equity investments. Denis, I believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bp drag on ROE from consumer. And I was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture, just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today. And are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come? Denis Coleman : Sure. I think the 80-basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items, which we have identified as the selected items, which we have announced, we are in the process of disposing of. Obviously, if we complete -- if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital relief potential. And we can obviously across the AWM franchise moved down the vast majority of the HPI exposure, that currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. So, you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the P&L components. And then over time, we will remove the capital. So, removing the capital associated with HPI and then ultimately moving the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time. Steven Chubak : That's great. And just for a follow-up on buybacks. Just stock is currently trading at 1.6x book, does suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to mid-teens ROE target. Just wanted to hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buy back at current valuation levels and in anticipation, at least of David's response, citing prioritization of organic growth where do you see the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically today? Denis Coleman : Our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. I think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition financing, that is an activity that's very core to Goldman Sachs. We have a historical leading market share position there given netting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. And so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the financing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital. And that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buffer heading into the fourth quarter. But we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing our dividend. That's a core part of our philosophy. And we do believe it's important to also continue to return capital to shareholders. We do have a higher valuation. We do think about that. We are sensitive to that, but I don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders. Operator : We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Devin Ryan : Question on just the alternative asset management fundraising. And looking at the fee rates. So, the largest at bucket corporate equity is seeing a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. I know there were some legacy funds in there that are sensing, but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rates, just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in recent years. And just when we should think about the inflection occurring as recently raised AUM moves into fee earnings? And then we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like out there. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Obviously, we put that disclosure out there, so you can track it and follow it over time. It's obviously very much mix dependent in terms of the nature of the particular at assets that are coming in thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise, an important to a lot of our investment in our clients are the services we provide through our OCIO offerings. But in certain of those portfolios, we do bring on board some Alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than paid Goldman Sachs fund generated alternative fee. So, we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. And for us, having scale is an important contributor, ultimately, to driving margins, efficiencies and returns in the business, but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. So, you may see some slight variation in that over time. Devin Ryan : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the trading business, obviously, results have been incredibly resilient and the firm has gained market share. And so, I'd love to get a little bit of a flavor, if you can, just around how much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how that's evolved over the past handful of years. I know there's been a lot of investment there, and you guys have some pretty differentiated offering. So, I just wanted to get a little bit of sense of that. And then how that plays into the story of market share from here just as you become more relevant with clients. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean we look at equity and then frankly, even FICC trading activities, the strategy facing clients is multichannel again. So, we have voice. We have high-touch voice, and we have electronic, and increasingly, we're finding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. So, we have both, call it, run rate, more plain vanilla intermediation activities. Now we have the capacity to either take on board more interesting structure or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process. and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Denis, I want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the $1 billion goal for performance fees. And I think you said $4 billion of unrecognized gains. You're obviously run rating well below that here year-to-date. Can you talk about the time period you think to get to that $1 billion? And is there seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter? Or is this something that should be more pro rata? Denis Coleman : So, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end to their investment cycle. Given a lot of the other commentary that we've been discussing about level of activity, strategically, openness of capital markets, in particular, equity capital markets, sponsor monetization activity, et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments, and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally. So as activity improves, we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run rate, $1 billion worth of incentive fees. But I can't tell you exactly the rates that comes in, that will be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees. Dan Fannon : Got it. And then just a follow-up on wealth management, understanding the strategy of growing lending. But can you talk about the growth overall of the adviser base and how you're thinking about that over the next kind of one to two years in terms of net recruiting, hires and ultimately, investment in that business beyond just diversifying the revenue streams? Denis Coleman : Sure. So, I think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisers needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program. So rather than having it a sort of ebb and flow across different market environments or based on what the firm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at different years in the past. I think part of the strategy of investing in what is a really outstanding business at Goldman Sachs, where we're the premier ultra-high net worth firm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisers over multiple years. And so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. And when David makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across AWM and that we are focused not just on margins and returns, but investing to grow. One of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the adviser footprint. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us your Goldman is in a unique position, I think, to be able to share with investors the benefits of private credit. I think, David, you mentioned you have $140 billion in private credit assets. And when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you, whether it's private credit or just lending. Can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that your customers may benefit from? David Solomon : So, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think one of the things that's interesting about this is, this gets framed in very binary ways. And obviously, private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. It certainly refers to a lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. It can refer to direct lending in the below investment-grade business, which, by the way, is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity, particularly with sponsors. It can be direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. So, there's a wide range of things. When I listened to your question, when I pull away as you're asking in particular about leverage finance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. And I'd say they don't go in through the bias, they're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. And I think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite distribute. We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their might needs might be different in different transactional situation. So, we like our positioning there. I do say that I believe from a secular perspective, there will be continued growth in private credit, particularly in the leveraged finance space. And so, we're looking to capture that. but it's more complicated. There are different channels, there's different origination efforts than sometimes the way this is all for trade. But we feel like we're well positioned across the spectrum to be a significant participant in this space. Gerard Cassidy : And David, just a quick follow-up on that. That was very thorough. Who do you find these your primary competitors? Again, you're in a unique position, I think, to be able to benefit from this. Who do you bump into the most? David Solomon : Well, it depends what you're doing. So, it goes back to exactly what I said it, it depends what you're doing. If you're in the leverage finance market and you're looking at a syndicated capital structure and you're competing for that, you're going to bump into JPMorgan, for example. If on the other hand, you're looking at direct lenders, then you're going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space, which can include people like HPS or Ares or other direct platforms. If you're looking at investment grade, insurance company balance sheet, you might run into Apollo. I mean it really depends on who the client is, what their need is and what the activity is. And it's actually quite a broad and complicated space. Denis Coleman : I mean the only thing I'd add, Gerard, if you just think about it, I think David has laid this out really well. If you think about where Goldman Sachs is positioned against this opportunity set. We have capacity to lend to alternative clients, for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. We have the capacity to underwrite and distribute different types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade capital structures and we have the capacity to offer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposed to the asset class. And while we compete with all of those different parties that David enumerated, I'm hard-pressed to find many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. So we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum. Operator : We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : I wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in Asset & Wealth Management. Year-to-date, you're at -- you got a 24% pretax margin. You've already reach the mid-20s medium-term target. I know you've talked about that margin expanding beyond mid-20s. But how do we think about where it can ultimately land in the time horizon around it? Obviously, you're growing your all business, you have $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees. You talked about the private banking and lending platform. Just can you get to a pretax margin of above 30% like your peers? And again, how do we think about the glide path from here and the time horizon around that? Denis Coleman : Sure. Thank you, Saul. So obviously, we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. I think it's important that we consolidate our position there. We think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating efficiencies across the business segment. There are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite, that are 30% or higher. So, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. But we're also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long term. So, we are going to try and find the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-term value in this segment. But for the time being, we think that both can be achieved. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could follow up on capital and just how you're thinking I know you talked about your capital strategy a bit. But how are you thinking about just capital allocation buybacks given the uncertainty around Basel, we have a proposal, we have the speech outlining the reproposal. We have an agency that seemingly one of the agencies, obviously, resisting seemingly the reproposal. We have an election that could play a big role in terms of influencing whatever outcome happens. So just -- I mean, how are you thinking about your capital? And why do you think a 90-basis point buffer is the write buffer given all that uncertainty. Denis Coleman : Okay. Thank you. Look, what I would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty. There's also been operating uncertainty as well. I think the economic trajectory, outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly, that presents opportunities. So, we run a buffer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. But we also run the buffer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory. As to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position, I couldn't tell you right now. But we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback. From everything we know, there are generally time lines associated with those rules coming into effect. And we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, January 15, 2025. I will now turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference. David Solomon : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to touch on the devastating fires that have spread across Los Angeles. Our thoughts are with the people of LA, including our colleagues and clients. We join everyone else in thanking the brave five firefighters and first responders working tirelessly to protect that community. Now let me turn to our results. I'm very pleased with our strong performance as we continue to serve our clients in a dynamic environment. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenues of $13.9 billion, earnings per share of $11.95, and ROE of 14.6% and an ROTE of 15.5%. For the full year, we increased our revenues by 16% to $53.5 billion. We grew our EPS by 77% to $40.54 and improved our ROE by over 500 basis points to 12.7% demonstrating strong operating leverage. Before we review our financials in detail, I will start today's presentation with a strategic update. Beginning on Page 1, we have a clear purpose at Goldman Sachs. We aspire to be the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our shared values of client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. These values are the foundation of our strategy and enable us to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. As shown on Page 2, our interconnected client franchises are at the core of our growth strategy. Our Global Banking and Markets business is distinguished by its scale, profitability and leadership positions. In Investment banking, we once again ended the year as the number one M&A advisor. In markets, we have the number one equities business and a leading fit franchise. These leadership positions have been built over decades of investment and they reflect the confidence and trust that our clients have in us. Our Asset and Wealth Management business is comprised of a leading global active asset manager, a top five alternatives franchise and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management business. This scaled business has over $3.1 trillion in assets under supervision with global breadth and depth across products and solutions. Importantly, our One Goldman Sachs operating philosophy drives the interconnectedness between these two world-class businesses, enabling us to seamlessly deliver a variety of unique solutions and execution capabilities to our clients. Turning to Page 3. Delivering excellence to our clients is only possible because of our greatest asset, our people. Their exceptional focus and dedication supported by our culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problems. Our people, history and culture have made Goldman Sachs an aspirational brand around the globe, which allows us to attract quality talent across the organization from our summer interns all the way to our partners, and we invest heavily in our people. Many of them have long careers at the firm, exemplified by the fact that over 40% of our partners started as campus hires. Of course, not all of our people stay at Goldman Sachs for their entire careers. Many believe for opportunities to lead other companies and investment firms. And these firms, in turn, often become important clients of Goldman Sachs. Today, more than 275 of our alumni are in C-suite roles at companies with either a market cap greater than $1 billion or assets under management of over $5 billion and hundreds of other alumni end up coming back to the firm as Boomerang hires, including roughly 25 partners and managing directors last year alone, a testament to our enduring brand and culture. All in, we have an exceptional client franchise supported by our best-in-class talent and culture, which enables us to drive our strategy forward, and it is critical that we continue to invest in our people. Now turning to Page 4. At our first Investor Day in 2020, we laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the firm. We also laid out a number of targets that we could be held accountable for our progress. Today, the evidence is clear, we have met or exceeded almost all of these targets. We have grown our revenues from $37 billion to $54 billion, nearly 50% while improving the durability of those revenue streams. In Global Banking and Markets, we've maintained our position as the leading M&A adviser in Investment banking and have improved our standing with the top 150 clients and thicken equities over the past five years. At the same time, we've significantly increased our more durable FICC and equity financing revenues, which together have grown at a 15% CAGR to a new record of $9.1 billion this year. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've consistently grown our more durable management and other fees in private banking and lending revenues, both of which were record in 2024. Notably, management and other fees surpassed $10 billion, exceeding our 2024 target. In addition, alternative fundraising surpassed $70 billion. The success is a direct result of our continued innovation developing new strategies and our long-standing track record of investment performance. Additionally, we further narrowed our strategic focus. We closed on the sale of GreenSky entered into an agreement with General Motors to transition their credit card program and sold our portfolio of seller financing loans. Turning to Page 5. Global Banking & Markets, our leading franchise has produced average revenues of $33 billion and an average ROE of 16% over the last five years across a variety of market environments, demonstrating the diversity and strength of this business. While no one has a crystal ball, there are a number of catalysts that we believe will continue to drive activity. There has been a meaningful shift in CEO confidence, particularly following the results of the U.S. election. Additionally, there is a significant backlog from sponsors and an overall increased appetite for dealmaking supported by an improving regulatory backdrop. The combination of these conditions should spur further activity in 2025. One large strategic opportunity we are particularly focused on relates to financing. Goldman Sachs operates the fulcrum of one of the most important structural trends currently taking place in finance. The emergence and growth of our private credit and other asset classes that can be privately deployed. Our unique origination capabilities position us to both connect companies' dependable capital and connect investors to assets that can produce superior returns. Earlier this week, we announced the formation of our Capital Solutions Group, which will harness the power of One Goldman Sachs to provide our clients a comprehensive suite of our financing, origination, structuring and risk management offerings across both public and private markets. We are taking the current capabilities of our financing group, adding coverage of financial sponsors and alternative asset management firms to better innovate and accelerate the delivery of services to clients. We are also creating an alternative origination group focused on sourcing to provide seamless coverage to our private credit and private equity clients. We are excited about providing our clients with access to differentiated sourcing and investment capabilities, which will in turn help us accelerate growth across the franchise. Now let me turn to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 6. Our assets under supervision reached another record, reflecting our 28th consecutive quarter of long-term fee based net inflows. In Wealth Management, our total client assets rose to $1.6 trillion. We also bolstered our more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019, and we continue to expect to drive high-single digit annual growth in the coming years. Turning to Page 7. We meaningfully improved our AWM pretax margin in 2024, achieving our medium-term target. In our journey to further improve the return profile of the firm, we are committed to driving this business towards mid-teens returns. We see significant growth opportunities across wealth management, alternatives and solutions. In Wealth Management, we are growing this business by increasing the number of advisers in the field and surrounding them with content specialists. We are expanding our loan product offerings, and we're elevating our overall client experience with further investment in our digital capabilities. In alternatives, we are scaling our flagship fund program and developing new strategies. We remain focused on penetrating the institutional client base and expanding our wealth channel. Additionally, we are investing in tailored solutions for institutional and third-party wealth clients, who continue to see customization across SMAs, direct indexing and ETFs in a structured form. On Page 8, we demonstrate the durability of the revenues across the firm. This is not the first time we've laid out this information, but it serves as a good reminder. Baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represent the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered to be more cyclical advisory, underwriting and intermediation. As I said last year, we believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In the 25 years since we became a public company, it hasn't happened once. The dark blue represents more durable revenues from financing, management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, which grew 13% versus 2023. Taken together, these two components made up approximately 70% of total revenues in 2024. In addition, given our diversified franchise, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to generate upside across different market environments, which further highlights the revenue generating power of our firm. Moving to Page 9. Operating efficiency remains one of our key strategic objectives. And while we have made progress, we believe there are significant opportunities to drive further efficiencies across our business. We've established a three year program as a part of our business planning process that will help us dynamically manage our expense base, harness technology and automation, and reinvest in our businesses. First, we are optimizing our organizational footprint by expanding our presence in strategic locations and calibrating our pyramid structure. Second, on spend management, we are optimizing transaction based expenses and looking to more efficiently manage our vendor and consultant relationships. We will also continue to reduce operating expense associated with our consolidated investment entities as we further sell down those assets. Lastly, we are leveraging AI solutions to scale and transform our engineering capabilities, simplify and modernize our technology stack, drive productivity. These efficiencies will allow us to further invest for growth and improve client experience. Moving to Page 10. We believe the path to our return targets is straightforward. First, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver mid-teens returns on our leading global banking and markets franchise. Second, we are making strong progress against our plan to drive asset wealth management to mid-teens and beyond. And lastly, we are driving platform solutions to pretax breakeven in 2025. Taken together, we have a clear path to producing our target returns, which will further unlock shareholder value. Before turning it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on regulation. Last month, trade groups representing the major U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs, filed suit against the Federal Reserve. We have long been concerned that the lack of transparency and the Fed's current stress testing creates uncertainty and at times produces results we cannot understand and which can lead to higher industry-wide borrowing costs, reduced market liquidity and inefficient capital allocations. For the industry, the bar to take this step was incredibly high. And while the Fed has announced that it's seeking to improve the stress test, the suit was filed to protect our rights. We believe it is our responsibility to continue to press for a more transparent regulatory process in order to foster a more efficient financial system that supports growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. In closing, I'm very confident about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. We are incredibly well positioned to serve our clients and to continue to drive strong returns for shareholders as we execute with a relentless emphasis on client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail. Denis Coleman : Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 11 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenues of $13.9 billion, EPS of $11.95, and ROE of 14.6% and an ROTE of 15.5%, resulting in full year EPS of $40.54 and an ROE of 12.7%. As David highlighted, we made significant progress this year on executing our strategic priorities. In aggregate, these select items had a de minimis impact on the firm's full year results. Turning to results by segment. Starting on Page 14. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $35 billion for the year, up 16% amid broad based strength versus last year. In the fourth quarter, Investment banking fees of $2.1 billion rose 24% year-over-year. Advisory revenues came in at $960 million and equity underwriting revenues increased substantially year-over-year to $499 million, as strong equity markets supported robust issuance activity. Net underwriting revenues rose 51% to $595 million amid higher leveraged finance activity, given the strengthening financing conditions post-election. For 2024, we maintained our number one position in the league tables for announced and completed M&A, ranked third in equity underwriting, and second in leverage lending. Despite strong accruals in the fourth quarter, our Investment Banking backlog rose sequentially and remains robust, particularly in advisory. The intensity of our client dialogues has been increasing, and we're seeing renewed CEO confidence and desire from sponsors to transact. While there remains some policy uncertainty, there is an expectation that the regulatory burden will be reduced, which should serve as a tailwind to risk assets and capital deployment. We are optimistic on the outlook for 2025 and expect a further pickup in M&A and IPO activity. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in currencies and mortgages. Record FICC financing revenues rose 34% versus last year, primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues were $2 billion, up 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong performance in cash products. Record Equities financing revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36% versus the prior year amid higher average balances in prime and stronger performance in portfolio financing. For the full year, total equities net revenues were a record $13.4 billion amidst strong levels of client engagement and higher client balances. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues rose 17% in 2024 to a record $9.1 billion. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 15. For 2024, revenues of $16.1 billion rose 16% year-over-year as our more durable revenues grew to new records. In the quarter, management and other fees were a record $2.8 billion, up 8% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Private banking and lending revenues rose 11% year-over-year to $736 million. Incentive fees for the quarter were $174 million, bringing our full year incentive fees to $393 million. We expect to make further progress in 2025 towards our annual target of $1 billion. Equity and debt investment revenues totaled $993 million for the quarter, reflecting markups across our private and public portfolios and NII in our debt portfolio. For the full year, these combined revenues totaled $2.4 billion. Now moving to Page 16. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $3.1 trillion, driven by $70 billion of liquidity products net inflows and $22 billion of long-term fee based net inflows across asset classes. Turning to Page 17 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $336 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $621 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $20 billion in the fourth quarter and $72 billion for the year. For 2025, we expect fundraising to be consistent with levels achieved in recent years. On Page 19, our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $196 billion, up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending. Our provision for credit losses was $351 million in the quarter, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and balance growth, partially offset by reserve releases in the wholesale portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $33.8 billion. Our 2024 compensation ratio net of provisions was 32%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. As David mentioned, we're driving efficiencies across our organizational structure, spend management and automation efforts, which will enable us to further invest across the client franchise. These efforts are designed to enhance productivity and help drive operating leverage, as we work towards achieving our through-the-cycle targets. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was 22.4%. For 2025, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20%. Next, capital on Slide 21. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, a 130 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13.7%. In the fourth quarter, we returned approximately $3 billion to common shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2 billion and dividends of $965 million. In conclusion, our strong performance this year reflects the strength of our client franchise, our intense focus on execution and an improving operating environment. We continue to maintain our leadership positions across Global Banking & Markets and are leaning into secular growth opportunities across Asset & Wealth Management. As we enter 2025, we remain confident in our ability to deliver for clients and drive strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess maybe just David following up on the comments you made around regulations. Like, when you talk to investors, I mean, we saw what happened with the SCB last year. And I think there's been a laser focus on being more punitive on capital markets post GFC for many justifiable reasons. But just talk to us when you think about the regulatory outlook and I appreciate significant uncertainty we're waiting for policymakers to kind of take new feed, but how do you think that plays out? And in particular, in terms of the operating backdrop for your capital markets business, investment banking business, like, how should we think about how could it be different over the next two to three years relative to the last five or even 10 years? David Solomon : Well, it's hard -- I mean, it's hard for me to speculate given where we are, and I appreciate the question. It's something, obviously, we're spending a lot of time thinking about, but I think they're obviously -- when you talk about capital, there are obviously three avenues. First, there is CCAR and you'd note the industry took an action because the industry doesn't think that the way CCAR operates and the lack of transparency is appropriate or candidly legal. And so that's why we took the action that we did. The Fed has commented that it plans to make changes in adjustments. But obviously, there are changes going on with the administration shift. There are changes going on at the Fed. And it's hard for me to speculate how that will all play forward other than to say that the industry believes, as an industry, we believe strongly, and we believe this for years, this is not working appropriately at a system with more transparent and consistent capital that you can plan around makes a more efficient and more productive system. And so we're hopeful that we'll make some progress with that. The second, obviously, is Basel III. And given the change in administration and the change of leadership inside the Fed, our expectation would be that there'll be a different approach than what have been put forward. But again, we'll have to watch, and we'll have to wait. And then last, there's G-SIB and the calibration of G-SIB. G-SIB was always supposed to be calibrated to growth in market cap economies it hasn't been. And so that's another avenue of dialogue. Net-net, unpredictable. I don't want to predict. I don't want to speculate. But certainly, it feels like we're in an environment where there could be a constructive discussion about improving the transparency, clarity and consistency around this. And I think that would be very, very good, both for the system and capital markets broadly (ph). Ebrahim Poonawala : That's fair. And just a follow-up on the Slide 5, you mentioned the forward catalyst, increased sponsor activity. We've been waiting for this. We have seen some signs of a pickup there. You've talked about M&A being sort of sub 10-year averages. Give us a sense of just how quickly -- I mean, we know the DOJ, FTC backdrop will be more conducive for dealmaking, just how quickly could we see a more significant ramp up around deals, IPOs? Is it a second half event? Could we see that as early as the next couple of months? David Solomon : I think you're going to see it throughout 2025. I don't want to speculate where it will land versus 10 year averages, but it's certainly setting up to be much more constructive and robust. And the data set that we would have that allows us to articulate that is, we can obviously track our backlog, but we can also track increased activities, dialogues inside the firm. And I\u2019d say there\u2019s been a meaningful pickup in large-cap M&A dialogue and inquiry. There\u2019s been a meaningful pickup in sponsor inquiry and dialogue, and we continue to see strong positive backlog trends as Denis highlighted to you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Christian Bolu : Good morning, David and Denis. Maybe just follow-up, maybe take a question here. But if I'm reading the slides correctly, footnotes 11 and 12, which help bridge your ROE gap to 15%. Are you assuming sort of roughly $9 billion of capital return from HPI platform solutions to shareholders? Because if you are, maybe talk through how that puts against things like SLR constraints at that level of capital return? And then just more broadly on capital, just given the improving opportunity set here, how are you balancing returning capital to shareholders versus investing in the business? David Solomon : Sure. So I'll start, and Denis will add, particularly on capital return. But our path to mid-teens is a simple analysis than what you laid forward. The firm is driving toward having two fundamental business platforms and we've been very clear on this as we've narrowed our focus, Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. We still have the legacy platforms, but we continue to make progress around that. Global Banking & Markets, I think, has shown over the course of the last five years that this business should be mid-teens throughout the cycle. On Asset & Wealth Management, we've commented to you that we've met our medium-term margin, target margin, but we have not yet improved the returns in that business to the levels that we believe that we can return them. We believe over the next couple of years, continued scaling and profitability in our alternative platform combined with our ability to continue to grow management fees and at the same time, also free up capital from legacy principal investments will allow us to bring the returns in Asset & Wealth Management to the mid-teens or higher. In addition, Platform Solutions, where we still have the Apple Card platform, this year, depending on how you look at it, and I'll give you rough numbers was a 75 basis point to 100 basis point drag on the firm's overall ROE, that will improve in 2025 and 2026. And so it's just math. If you have a mid-teens Global Banking & Markets business, if we get Asset & Wealth Management, the mid-teens plus and we removed the drag from the platform that gets you to a mid-teens business. We have a high level of confidence in our ability to execute against that. Denis will give you a comment. We're obviously generating a lot of capital. We do see opportunities to deploy. So Denis will give you some comments on how we're thinking about capital deployment and also returns. Denis Coleman : Sure. Thanks, David. And Christian, I think you're making references some capital release numbers. Within the overall remaining portfolio of HPI, we do note that there's about $4 billion of retaining attributable \u2013 of remaining attributable equity. And then, obviously, over time, we both have to narrow the pretax drag in Platform Solutions and ultimately, someday may be able to release all of the equity associated with that business as well. So those are obviously contributors to our longer-term return target achievement. I think as it relates to capital return, as we sit headed into 2025, we have 130 basis points of cushion versus Reg Min (ph). As David has commented, as the firm believes there should be a significant uptick in client opportunity. As always, we would look to fill that demand as best we possibly can as a matter of priority. We remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend, and then obviously, seek to return excess capital. You all will have noted last year was a record year for capital return by Goldman Sachs. So we were able to grow the franchise, grow the firm as well as return record levels of capital to shareholders. As we head into '25, we'll support clients, invest in sustainably grow our dividend and then to the extent we have excess capital return it to shareholders, all the while managing an appropriate buffer given some of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Christian Bolu : Okay. Got you. Maybe David, look, kudos to you on the firm, you're clearly taking share across your businesses, whether it's markets or alternatives and in private wealth doing a great job. But just given to your point, the improved opportunity set here and perhaps more friendly regulatory environment. Any thoughts on doing a strategic deal to accelerate your growth prospects within alts or private wealth? David Solomon : Yeah. I appreciate the question, Christian. And look, we always think about, particularly around our Asset & Wealth platform, are there things that could accelerate our growth and journey and the overall mix of the firm. As I've said before, the bar for doing something is high. I'd also say, these businesses are sold, they're not bought. And at the moment, the market is valuing these businesses with an extraordinary amount of forward growth. But we obviously watch the space. And over time, could there be opportunities? Yes. But at the moment, we\u2019re very focused on execution. I think one of the things we\u2019re so excited about for the firm is we have an ability to continue to execute organically on what we\u2019ve laid out in front of you and continue to improve the returns of the firm. Plus, I think as you point out, we have tailwinds from both the environment and improving environment for the kinds of activities that flow into our ecosystem and also the overall business and regulatory environment. So I think execution right now continues to be our primary focus. Operator : We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. David Solomon : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I did just want to follow up on one thing here regarding the point you were making on Platform Solutions. It's a drag right now, 75 bps to 100 bps on ROE, but '25 and '26, that will improve. So could you just step us through -- I mean, we know what your plans are for Platform Solutions. But I'm wondering what's happening in '25 and '26 that will drive the reduction of the drag in this year and next, if you could speak through that. David Solomon : Yeah. At a high level, Betsy, we're obviously -- the primary thing is in Platform Solutions is the Apple partnership. As you know, we have a contract with Apple to run that partnership until 2030, although, there's some possibility that it won't continue until that time frame. The most important thing that's happening is the card continues to improve and its performance and the card is driving towards profitability. And so the improvement in the profitability of the card has an impact on the short-term drag. Ultimately, whether it's in the medium-term or through the life of the contract, that's not going to be a long-term business for the firm, and that will ultimately allow us to exit and return capital, but I'm really not in a position to comment any more specifically other than the direction of travel that you're aware of. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Great. And then separately on the changes that were discussed with regard to how you're structuring the financing team that's within investment banking, if I got it right. Could you just help us understand, how does this management structuring change the revenue growth outlook that you're looking for? Like, why did this deliver better growth? David Solomon : Sure. So -- yeah. So first of all, it's in Global Banking & Markets. And so I think the way, Betsy, you should think about Global Banking & Markets, and we've been on a journey to really think about all the efficiencies that exist between what was the traditional investment banking business, what we'll call the financing or capital markets businesses and then the global markets businesses, which are the trading businesses, and we brought them all together in Global Banking & Markets. I think you should now think about that big business, that big $35 billion business as kind of having three big platforms. One is what we call traditional investment banking; two is what we call capital solutions; and three is what we call global markets or trading. The organizational structure that we're creating allows us, we believe, to take advantage of something that Goldman Sachs is very uniquely positioned at the fulcrum of which is this intersection between both public markets and private markets and the way you marry capital with issuers, but also marrying issuers and their need for capital with all different kinds of investors. And I think the thing that we're very uniquely positioned on is, one, we have extraordinary relationships with 12,000 companies in the world. Two, we have extraordinary what I'll call public market financing capabilities. But three, we also have an ability, whether it's through our balance sheet, whether it's through what you'll call traditional distribution channels into institutional clients or it's through our asset management platform and our own asset management products have a range of alternatives that we can marry to issuers to make sure they get the best product service and results. And so this is a way of getting that all coordinated in OneGS fashion across the firm. And so we've taken the traditional financing businesses and capital markets businesses. We've taken all the coverage of financial sponsors. We've taken all the coverage of alternative firms in our trading businesses and we are putting them together and we're bringing talent that understands both our own balance sheet and capital deployment and the ability to distribute these products together to try to optimize our capability around that. And this is where we actually think there's going to be growth in the capital markets. And so our ability to capture more of that share, we think the setup allows us on a relative performance basis to do better. Denis Coleman : And Betsy, one thing I'd add just in terms of overall financials, obviously, our segments are not changing. The subsegments that we report into are not changing. These -- this sort of streamlined synthesized origination capability, we think will enable us to accelerate revenue growth by serving our clients more efficiently, but the suite of activities that are undertaken by these originators and instructors we'll continue to populate the same financial line items that we have today. We just think this is a better way of organizing our people against the client opportunity set and doing everything else that David just enumerated. David Solomon : And look, if you go back in history, Betsy, just to expand on it. I mean years ago, the capital markets business is 25 years ago, the Capital Markets business has sat in the trading businesses. And 20 years ago, it was a dramatic thing to put them in investment banking, so they were closer to clients. And so our mindset is always how do we organize our people and our resources, create a OneGS ethos and be is connected to our clients to make the experience for our clients as seamless and is simplified and is leveraging as possible. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You spoke earlier to the capital unlock within the improving ROEs in AWM. But some of the more business oriented components would be driving lending solutions within wealth and scaling the flagship products and all, which I thought was interesting. I was hoping you could speak to lending penetration and where that sits versus your target within the wealth business and whether there's been an uptick in demand more recently, given some of the market developments and what contribution you're expecting from ranking the flagships and maybe highlighting some of those franchises? Thanks. Denis Coleman : Sure, Brennan. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. So obviously, the strategy to grow wealth is three part in terms of primary focus : Wealth Management, Alts and Solutions. Within Wealth Management, you enumerate one particularly attractive opportunity set for us, which is lending. And we've noted previously that we believe that we are relatively underpenetrated, relative to some of our competitors across our wealth platform. And we've been making investments in our human capital expertise, educating our client-facing professionals that we have capabilities and ambitions to support clients through lending activities. We did grow our private wealth lending balance is about $5 billion on the year. We are committed to a multiyear journey of increased penetration. I think relatively, we are still very low. So we are making progress. We are optimistic, but I think we have a lot of room to improve that. In terms of the Alts business, there are a number of ways that we continue to grow and make progress in our Alts franchise. It continues to be an attractive and appropriate component of our wealth clients portfolio. We have very good manufacturing capabilities as a firm and also a robust third-party wealth channel as well that clients can take advantage of within the portfolio of alternative offerings that we make available to clients. We have certain of our flagship funds and those are raised from time-to-time, and those are attractive opportunities for us to secure client for deployment, and they also position the firm well as a known and credible deployer of capital. So we'll continue to raise those funds over time. And as we have more assets under management per strategy, if you will, better depth that will enable us to improve the overall operating leverage of that component of the Asset & Wealth Management business. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. And David spoke to some of the operating efficiencies when reviewing -- when giving the strategic update. It's interesting because how do we think about the push and pull of expenses and efficiencies as we move into 2025 given the expectations for pretty robust and all the indications you've given for a pretty robust improvement in capital markets activity or maybe if it's easier to answer, what's the right way to think about incremental margins on revenue growth as we move forward. Denis Coleman : Sure, Brennan. I appreciate that. We're actually trying to do a number of things at the same time, which is what gives rise to your question. So first and foremost, we continue to see good opportunities to grow the firm, and we expect that as we continue to grow the firm, we should be able to continue to deliver incremental operating leverage. You saw in the course of the last year that our efficiency ratio improved by 1,200 basis points. Now it's on the order of 63%, moving closer to our target of 60%. So scaling the business, driving incremental operating leverage continues to be a huge focus of this management team. It's also the case that we see very attractive opportunities to make investments to scale the firm, to improve client experience, to improve our employees' productivity, and we want to be able to finance some of that incremental investment spend, a lot of which takes place in the engineering space by driving incremental efficiencies across the firm. And thinking about, as David ran through the ways we organize ourselves, the way we locate our professionals, the way we manage our spend processes, accountability this program that David made reference to has accountability up to the management committee of the firm. It's an important piece of how we focus on running the firm efficiently, and we think it's something that's designed to give us capacity to fund some of the investments that we think are the best ways to continue to scale the firm make it more resilient and improve overall client and employee experience. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, David. There was another Wall Street's CEO who said he was the most positive he's been in 25 years. So how good could things get in your mind because you're saying the regulatory environment, the economic environment, the backlogs are up and that if I was doing a model for the industry, if we go back to the '21 pandemic highs? And on the other side of this, as highlighted by Slide 9, you're all focused on expenses. And on the -- maybe if rates go up too much, what level of a 10 year yield do you think it puts a wrinkle in the kind of the bullish thesis you're laying out here, a 10 year 5%, 6%, 7%. What's the most likely thing that would drill your lofty expectations? David Solomon : Look, Mike, I appreciate the question, and I'd say at a high level, there's no question that I highlighted in my remarks. There's been a sentiment shift broadly as I talk to CEOs since the election. But that doesn't stop us from at Goldman Sachs constantly thinking by nature of risk managers thinking about how the environment can change, how that can evolve. I think at the moment, for our business and our business mix, particularly, around capital markets activity, etc. We have -- it feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025. And I do think that levels that have been below historical averages are going to a minimum normalize, maybe do better. I certainly wouldn't say, I have any expectation of capital markets activity going back to 2021, anomalies anytime soon, but it is a more constructive environment. And so that, of course, is something that we think about as we think about deployment of resources and investment in the business. Now all that said, we can't predict the environment. The environment changes and we're running the firm for the medium and the long term. And so we are very, very focused on our growth and returns over the medium term, our growth of the firm over the medium term and our ability to serve our clients and execute well. And I am very confident, very, very confident that no matter what the world throws at us, Goldman Sachs over time will continue on that journey of doing really well and growing the returns of the firm and serving our clients with excellence and distinction. I think the environment feels good, but I'm not at all confused that I could wake up in three months and there could be things going on in the world that would change that perspective. And we're always thinking about that, always trying to look around corners and are always going to manage the firm for the medium and the long-term. Mike Mayo : And then specifically, I guess why is Platform Solutions still around? I mean you're number one in deal making and you haven't been able to work that out. And on the other hand, the financing organic growth, how big is that today and how big do you expect that to be in five years, and what about credit risk that's related to that? Thanks. David Solomon : Yeah. On the first question, I don't really have anything to say. It's different than what I've said about our journey around the consumer platforms in the business, but I appreciate the question. On the second point, we continue to believe that there's opportunity for our -- for us to grow our financing business. Our financing business scales with growth in the world. Of course, we're incredibly focused on risk management and credit risk and the scale of that business against our equity base and our balance sheet, etc. But as the world grows, we believe there's opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale that business. And I think we've proven that over time. I mean, Denis, do you want to add anything around that? Denis Coleman : Yeah. Just I draw a connection back, Mike, to some of the comments that David made earlier, which is, if really the secret sauce in driving some of these activities for clients is origination, distinction and differentiation. The establishment of the Capital Solutions Group enables us to have all of that origination centralized and we can, from that origination continue to grow the FICC financing balance sheet in an appropriate risk adjusted fashion. We can underwrite and distribute some of that product to other investors across our franchise, and we can also help AWM source investments that provide attractive risk adjusted returns to the clients at AWM. So there's an opportunity to continue to invest in growing the financing capabilities that we've been reporting on, but we also have incremental outlets for the origination excellence given the demand that we see across various types of investors around the market. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Devin Ryan : Thanks so much. Good morning, David and Denis. First question just on the banking and markets, market share, wallet share, obviously, incredibly impressive over the last handful of years. And I think just a testament to the execution. When we look at this kind of new capital solutions organization, it would seemingly better positioned with sponsor clients and just, I think, gives that indication of where you guys are going there. How do you think about your market share today with sponsors and not sure if you can give any framework or numbers there? And then, how you think about the ability to take share in that group and how important that will be to driving further kind of wallet share gains from here like you've done in the past? Thanks. David Solomon : Yeah. We -- I mean, we've -- over the last 20 years, we've made enormous investment in our relationships and our coverage and sponsor community. We have leading share with the sponsors. I don't think we quantify it specifically. But we have -- it's fair to say, we have leading share with sponsor community. I think we're very well positioned as they're active to capture our fair share and even sometimes more than our fair share of that activity. What I'd say is, it's been an environment where they've been incredibly quiet both from a deployment perspective, also a monetization perspective, and that's just not consistent. I've said consistently that sponsors make money by doing two things : buying new things, selling old things. And so the fact that we've gone through a period of time where they haven't done a lot of either of those things, that will normalize over time. Part of it was a reset in kind of valuation expectations. Some of it was growing into valuation expectations that are kind of run ahead, but I do believe very strongly that the next 24 months will be a much more constructive environment to response to activity. And our share positioning with them is very good. I think these organizational changes will only strengthen that position. Devin Ryan : Great. Thank you. And then, just in terms of on the alternative asset management fundraising has been terrific. How should we think about the pace of deployment of kind of that record fundraising and then just kind of the trajectory of kind of the acceleration in performance fees because it would seem that, that -- there could be a pretty big step function higher in performance fees, but you need to deploy that capital first. So just the time line to kind of think through that path. Thank you. Denis Coleman : Sure, Devin. So we're focused on that as well. And it's a good question because it hits a number of topics. So obviously, we had good success raising Alts funds and surpassed all the various targets that we set out repeatedly, but now it's an opportunity for us to deploy. And the deal making environment and the transaction volumes moving to the market over the last couple of years being subdued has also impacted our ability to deploy into transaction. So as the overall backdrop improves, that should be a more attractive opportunity for us to start deploying the money that we've raised and drive our AUS. At the same time, that same slightly more muted environment for transaction activity has been -- there's been less by way of monetization activity. And so as we, again, enter into, hopefully, a more supportive backdrop, there will be better opportunities for us to continue to monetize investments across our fund structures, and as we reach the end of investment cycles and fully monetize and become in a position to start returning capital to our investors, then you'll see the incentive fees start to come through our financials as well. Our incentive fees were up sharply on a year-over-year basis, but they're still short of our $1 billion annual target. Our expectation is that we will continue to make progress towards that target over the course of 2025, the extent of that progress, obviously, will be a function of the environment, but we should continue to make progress towards the $1 billion target, given where we sit in the outlook that we have. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Dan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the alternatives. You talked about consistent levels of fundraising as we look at '25. Could you maybe talk to the asset classes or the funds that you think will drive that growth going forward and how the fees may be different or are they the same as kind of what's in the ground of your existing book of alternatives today? Denis Coleman : Sure. So given the breadth of our alternatives platform, the fundraising has come in from a number of different channels has been very diversified. And I think that's one of the strengths of our platform is one of the ways it positions us as one of the top five alternative players in the market. So as we move forward, we would continue to expect to raise money across the various asset classes within our alternatives platform. We are not seeing significant fee compressed, if you will. That's a question that we get on the Alts side. So we'd expect to be raising the same type of funds with roughly the same fee structure, there obviously can be variations in mix. And so different types of alts products sourced through different channels bring with them different fees. So that can change average effective fees in the Alts space. But in terms of our strategy, continue to raise a diversified suite of funds, expect a reasonably consistent volume and don't expect fees per type of origination activity to meaningfully change. Dan Fannon : Understood. And then just as a follow-up, both Asset & Wealth Management revenues on the management fee side, we saw good growth year-over-year, both for the year and the fourth quarter. There was a little bit higher growth in wealth, both in the fourth quarter and the year. I guess, as you look at those businesses going forward, do you expect to see a divergence in either of those segments or do you think that consistently, they will both grow at similar levels? Denis Coleman : So look, there are obviously different idiosyncratic factors within both the asset management and the wealth management sectors. We obviously like the optionality to continue to raise and grow our management fees across both of those subsegments. And we re-underwrite our expectation that we will continue to grow AWM management and other fees, high-single digits over the next several years. We've obviously outpaced that recently, but we sort of would re-underwrite our forward growth expectations to be high-single digits. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, David. Hi, Denis. David or Denis, can you share with us -- I mean, the outlook, many of us -- you folks included, I think, looks very positive for the capital markets businesses, the economy, etc. And aside from the geopolitical risks that are obvious to all of us. Can you guys give us two or three risks where could derail this shared optimism we have for the outlook for the business? David Solomon : I mean the world -- I mean, I appreciate the question, right. The world is a complicated place, and there's a lot going on in the world. Markets reacting can change their sentiments very, very quickly. We obviously have a new administration with that change. There are a bunch of things people are talking about that have people excited from a business environment, a lower regulatory touch environment, etc. But at the same point, there are a broad array of policy initiatives that can all have an impact on market sentiment and the direction of travel. And I'd say, at the moment, there's uncertainty. When you look broadly across immigration policy, trade policy, tax policy, energy policy, we'll get more clarity around all of this, but there are different outcomes. There can be sentiment shifts plus there's a lot going on in the world. And there are all sorts of significant risk we spend a lot of time thinking about. We think about cyber risk a lot. It's something we haven't talked about in a while on this call. So the world is a complicated place. Fundamentally, at our core risk managers, we try to think about these things, make sure the firm is resilient and well positioned to navigate them. And I would say, at the moment, the environment is quite constructive. The economy in the U.S. is quite constructive still. But it's a complicated world. And I think we all should be on our toes and be prepared for the unexpected because I tell you every single year the consensus that people tell me in January, the year turns out to be different than the consensus. And I'm sure this year, there'll be some surprises to the ups, and there'll be some surprises to the downs as there always are. Gerard Cassidy : Yeah. No, I agree with that. That's for sure. Thank you, David. And then coming back to, obviously, you guys have been investing heavily in technology for years in driving those operating efficiencies. In Slide 9, you talk about them, particularly in automation. And then you talk about leveraging the AI solutions. As outsiders, when do you think we'll be able to see the success that you're having with AI. I know there's probably early successes already, but will there become a time when we'll be able to say, wow, earnings were actually favorably impacted by X percent because of the success in the AI implementation that you've done? David Solomon : We are having early success. And this firm is zealously focused on its expense base and creating efficiencies that give us the capacity to invest in our franchise and grow our client franchise. Can we get to a point where you can say it's affected by this percent? I don't necessarily think that's the way to think about it. We're going to continue to use technology to make the firm more productive. We're going to continue to scale and create automation of platforms that allow us to deploy resources and other places will allow us to serve our clients better and grow our franchise. And that's something we're going to continue to be operationally very focused on. We've made good progress on it, but we have -- we see and we have and Denis explained this in his comments and I hinted at it too. We see lots of opportunities to continue to do that in the coming years. And I think the way that investors should look at it and think about it, it's that focus on that and the capacity it creates allows us to scale investments that can continue to strengthen the franchise. And so that's the way I think we think about it and we try to operate. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
