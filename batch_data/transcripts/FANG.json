Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's call is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s first quarter conference call. Representing Diamondback today are; Travis Stice, CEO; Tracy Dick, CFO; and Russell Pantermuehl, VP of Reservoir Engineering. During this conference call the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can we found in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you all for listening to Diamondback\u2019s first quarter 2014 conference call. Since our last call we\u2019ve issued an operations update that highlighted our continued growth in production volumes, our first two successful Martin County Wolfcamp B tests, as well as continued positive developments in Midland and Upton Counties. Our Gridiron well in Midland County is the best well we have drilled to date and also appears to be one of the top horizontal wells in the Midland Basin. As we have said before, we have increased our development focused on the lower Spraberry with wells now drilled in both Midland and Upton Counties. Lastly our first Wolfcamp B well in Dawson County has confirmed economic viability in our northernmost acreage and we plan to follow up with a test in the Cline Shale also known as the Wolfcamp B during the third quarter. Switching now to the first quarter, I am proud of the quarterly results as we again demonstrated our ability to grow production volumes by 30% from the prior quarter while keeping operating expenses low. With LOE at less than $6.50 barrel we are in line with our guidance even as we continue to move further north where our cost reduction infrastructure projects are still being implemented. Our low-cost operating metrics combined with higher percentage of oil production drives our peer-leading cash margins with the first quarter coming in at nearly $67 a BOE, which is up from $64 a BOE in the fourth quarter of 2013. We continue to be an aggressive developer of our horizontal inventory and we are operating five horizontal rigs as previously planned. We expect to grow production by more than 125% this year. We are currently running three horizontal rigs on our acreage in Midland County, one in Upton County and one in Martin County. As a reminder, we report all of our well results on a 2- stream basis. In Midland County, we are excited about our most recent Wolfcamp B test, the Gridiron 1H, our highest 24-IP rate to date at 2757 barrels of oil equivalent with a 91% oil cut that was drilled with an 8785 foot lateral and is still flowing back. In Dawson County, our first horizontal Wolfcamp B well produced a peak 24-hour IP rate of 541 barrels of oil equivalent with a 92% oil cut from an 8543 foot lateral on ESP. We plan to test the Cline Shale also known as the Wolfcamp B on this acreage during the third quarter. As exciting as the horizontal Wolfcamp B has been and continues to be, early indications from the lower Spraberry continue to be competitive with our existing Wolfcamp B program with respect to both rate of return and the EURs. Our first operated horizontal lower Spraberry well in Midland County produced a peak 12-hour IP rate of 1049 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a 92% oil cut from a 4418 foot lateral thus far on ESP. Additionally, we are currently flowing back our first lower Spraberry well in Upton County that we believe is the southernmost test of the horizontal lower Spraberry in the Midland Basin. We've just successfully drilled our first 3-well pad in Upton County where three roughly 5000 foot laterals in the Wolfcamp B were drilled in less than 40 days. While these wells are not yet completed, we have reduced total drilling costs for almost $500,000 for the 3-well pad and significantly improved our cycle time. When you review our results in each of our development areas, we are consistently at or above our type curve projections and within our cost guidance. I think this is significant in that we have now drilled over 60 horizontal wells since our IPO less than 18 months ago. That\u2019s really attribute to our organization and gives confidence to our stockholders Diamondback will continue to deliver on the multi-rig horizontal program with extreme focus on execution and efficiencies and reconfirming our full-year guidance as previously reported. With these comments complete, allow me to turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Travis. Our net income for the first quarter was $23.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Net income for the period included a non-cash loss on commodity derivatives of 1.6 million. Excluding the non-cash loss and the related income tax effects our adjusted net income was $25.7 million or $0.53 per diluted share. As previously reported our production for the first quarter was approximately 13,600 BOE per day and 79% for this production was oil. These volumes generated revenues in the first quarter of $98 million and EBITDA $81.3 million. Our average realized price before the effect of hedges for the first quarter was $80.35 per BOE. Our average realized price, including the effective hedges was $79.48 per BOE. Turning to our cost, our lease operating expense was $6.49 per BOE in the first quarter. Our general and administrative costs came in at $3.74 per BOE, which include non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.2 million. Excluding stock-based compensation G&A costs are $1.94 per BOE. Interest expense on our income statement for the quarter was $6.5 million. We capitalized $2.9 million of interest to our forecast full cost pool. Our current hedge positions through 2015 have been laid out in our earnings release. We currently have 50% of our estimated crude oil production hedged at an average price of $99 of barrel further remainder of 2014. We continually assess our hedging opportunities and we will continue to layer on additional hedges as our production grows. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we generated $71 million of operating cash flow and $80 million of discretionary cash flow or $1.46 and a $1.64 per diluted share respectively. During the first quarter of 2014, we spent $86.4 million for drilling, completion and infrastructure. Additionally, we spent approximately $312.2 million on leasehold acquisition. Our liquidity position remains strong, with approximately $25 million of cash on hand at March 31, 2014. Our agent lender has approved a borrowing base increase of a 100% to $415 million based on our current reserves. As of March 31, 2014 revolver has $147 million drawn against it. In summary, our focus continues to be on cost efficiencies. We maintain a strong balance sheet and we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and drilling program. I will turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. To summarize, I am proud of our continued success in driving production growth, continued improvement executing on these complex well pads, and operating with low-cost structures. These combined to drive our peer-leading cash margins and I believe we continue to deliver results and stockholder returns that are among the best in the Midland Basin. As mentioned in our earnings release, Diamondback's wholly-owned subsidiary, Viper Energy Partners LP, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its proposed initial public offering of limited partnership interest. Because the S-1 is on file, I am not in a position to make any further comment regarding the offering. On behalf of the Board and employees of Diamondback Energy, I would like to thank you for your participation today. This concludes our prepared comments. Operator, please open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich Securities. Your line is open. Jason A. Wangler: Good morning, guys. Travis D. Stice: Hi, Jason. Jason A. Wangler: Just curious, obviously results have been really solid in the Spraberry. Do you see that being pretty uniform across your acreage at least, much like the B in that you are going to be pretty prospective across the entire position for the Spraberry as well? Travis D. Stice: Yes, I think certainly when you look at the Spraberry in general, it is one of the more continuously deposited shales across the Midland Basin and certainly when you look at our position with probably the exception of the far northernmost acreage, all of our acreage has prospectivity on the Spraberry. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. That is great. And then, just I think you mentioned it in your comments but the Cline Shale test or the first well I should say I guess, is that going to be up north in Dawson? Or just maybe if that is right, just the thought process of putting it up that way? Travis D. Stice: Yes, exactly. It will be in Dawson County and really what we are doing is we are capitalizing on some additional work that we have got since we drilled that first well, the Kent County School Lanes, we cut a hole core when we drilled the vertical well up there and cut a hole core and while the Wolfcamp B, the geochemical work confirms that we were in the oil generation window, when you move about 600 feet deeper into the Cline Shale, you are actually moving even further into what we call the peak oil window. So that is why we in the next couple of weeks we will spud that Cline test in Dawson County. Jason A. Wangler: I appreciate it. I will turn it back. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff your line is open, please unmute. Jeff S. Grampp: Can you guys here me? Travis D. Stice: Yes. Jeff S. Grampp: Just kind of a strategic question for you guys. If and when this Viper offering goes through obviously guys your liquidity position would improve significantly, giving you guys a lot more flexibility to accelerate. I was wondering what obviously other than just the capital constraint or any other potential constraints in regards to ramping up the rig count whether that be services or infrastructure or anything else on that front? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, without any specific comments on the Viper transaction that is one of the things that I consider at the CEO level my most important job is allocation of resources, both human and capital. And as it pertains to the capital allocation, we always look forward to try and accelerate as much of our inventory forward as we can. And what that depends on strategically is continued de-risking of some of the northern blocks which we are starting to feel pretty comfortable on as well as infrastructure issues like access accumulation and disposal of stimulation water. So it is really about a 3 by 3 decision matrix when it comes to trying to accelerate but that is certainly high on our priority list is to try to accelerate as much inventory forward as we can. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay, great. And then kind of on that topic of de-risking has any of the recent activity either by yourselves or the industry really changed your thoughts on rig allocation or maybe development of other formations obviously focused mostly on the B bench and again good results on the Spraberry. But have you guys really changed your thoughts recently on where you are going to focus the majority of either your rig count or on a well account basis? Travis D. Stice: Well, certainly the lower Spraberry continues to significantly exceed our expectations and significantly exceed the type curves that we adopted from Ryder Scott at the end of last year. And again when it gets back to capital allocation, we are going to put the drill bit where we can generate the greater shareholder returns. And I think what you\u2019re going to see is a continued mix perhaps more emphasis in the lower Spraberry. But in our most developed areas and our core areas, we are going to focus on a Wolfcamp B and a Spraberry development. And then as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've drilled and completed \u2013 are in \u2013 I think we are day 8 flow back on the first lower Spraberry horizontal well in Upton County and certainly stay tuned for that because if that play pans out in the lower Spraberry, that will give us a significant development uptick down there in Upton County. And then lastly just the northern acreage specifically up in Dawson County. I mentioned our next test is in the Cline Shale and not only is that supported by the geochemical work that we talked about just a second ago, but it is also supported by some significant operator tests in northern Martin County and Northeast Andrews County which support the prospectivity of the Cline, that\u2019s in the North. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons we are excited about this Cline test as well. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then the last one for me just kind of hoping to get an update on maybe what recent well costs have been for you guys and maybe relating that to that $6.9 million to $7.4 million range in your guidance or maybe if you guys just have any kind of generic well cost targets that you are trying to get by year-end or anything on that front? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, at this point I think it is still fair to stay within our guidance. I mentioned a 3-well pad that we drilled down in Upton County we have not completed it yet but that 3-well pad will takeoff around $500,000 for that 3-well set. So to the extent we can drill more wells on pads, we are going to be biased at the low end of our range. To the extent we are still drilling single wells; we will be probably at the midpoint of that range. I gave you a data point on that long lateral in Midland County. It was right at $9 million and it is going to pay out in 120 days and we have just drilled and got casing on bottom on its offset and we will soon spud a third well on that acreage block. And that is a 2,500 acre block that is undrilled with horizontal wells. So we are excited to follow that up. But I like where we are headed on our costs and we will just have to maintain the discipline and focus on execution and make sure our costs are bias towards the low end. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And then, just kind of clarification, that $500,000 savings on the 3-well pad, is that $500,000 per well or is that an aggregate savings for the whole pad? Travis D. Stice: An aggregate savings for the whole pad and again, we have got over 60 wells drilled and we are pretty far down on the efficiency and learning curve side of the equation so we are picking up pennies and nickels at this point every day. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay, that is it for me. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Good quarter. Travis D. Stice: You bet. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave Kistler with Simmons & Co. Your line is open. Dave W. Kistler: Good morning, guys. Travis D. Stice: Hey, Dave. How are you today? Dave W. Kistler: Well, thank you. I had a question maybe a little bit higher level in terms of just understanding specifically in the Wolfcamp B, kind of Midland Andrews area, what sort of recovery of resource in place do you think you are currently achieving? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Dave. That\u2019s a hard number for the industry to try to come up with and it all depends on how you want to calculate oil in place. But if you are looking for kind of a ballpark number for the Wolfcamp B, I think somewhere 8% to 10%, 8% to 12% something like that. But again it is highly dependent on how you want to calculate original in place. Dave W. Kistler: Sure, no. I appreciate that. Kind of the gist of where I'm taking the question is you guys have certainly been leading the way in terms of driving down well costs and delivering on efficiency gains, et cetera. And you have talked about now being able to squeeze out nickels and dimes as opposed to quarters, etc. But are you now kind of at a point where you want to maybe mess around a little bit more with changing well design or completion techniques or things like that to potentially increase that recoverable resource level? I am just curious to get your thought process on that. Travis D. Stice: Yes, Dave, that is a good question as we as engineers, we always like the engineers and geoscientists, we always like to try to tweak things and I think you will see that in some of our completion designs, the tweaks but they are not major overhauls. We have been and have proven to ourselves that a slick water shop is the best way to stimulate these shales so we are going to continue to stay with slick water. But maybe in a more macro sense, I think the spacing question is yet to be defined by the industry and while in Midland County where we have got the most information we are drilling inter-lateral spacing at 660 feet. I think we are very actively watching other industry tests that are out there that are even increasing that down spacing further. And to the extent that the industry proves up tighter down spacing, we will like we always do, we will be a fast follower to that decision point. Dave W. Kistler: Perfect. I really appreciate that color. Thanks so much, guys. Travis D. Stice: You bet, Dave. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Connolly with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Hey, good morning, guys. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned higher LOEs on the northern acreage because of less infrastructure. Can you kind of just give us an overview of how the LOE has changed versus your operating areas? Travis D. Stice: Well, specifically we acquired the east (indiscernible) asset in order this year, picked up 147 vertical wells and typically these vertical wells have a little higher LOE than a horizontal well from both from an absolute dollar perspective and a volume perspective when you look at a dollar per barrel metric. So I anticipate as we continue to move North and more and more horizontal wells and horizontal production becomes a higher percent of the total that you will start seeing some adjustments to the LOE. But just as we incorporate straight out 147 vertical, you see just a slight uptick in LOE until we get our horizontal rigs back to work up there. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Thanks. That was helpful. Can you just give us a quick overview of what you are seeing in the M&A market and what kind of prices, acreage packages, stuff like that? Any update? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, there is no doubt that the Permian Basin has been one of the hottest basins in our whole industry when it comes to M&A activity and what that means when times are hot, that means that acreage prices or entry costs are going up. That being said, we still believe that we have got opportunities in front of us to grow both inorganically and organically but with that we've got to be opportunistic and we've got to be disciplined. When I talk about being opportunistic, sometimes that means price expectations and sometimes that means strategically. But I want to be clear that as we look at these deals we are only going to do deals that are accretive to our shareholders. And that is where that discipline comes into play. Our industry is littered with the bones of companies that have been trying to grow inorganically through acquisitions and perhaps in my past some of those bones have been mine. And they did that because they lost the discipline and they ultimately paid too much. So one thing that you can count on Diamondback is we are going to maintain that discipline as we grow both organically and inorganically. Now what that means though is that while there are deals out there and you still see deal flow, this strategy means that we are not going to win every competitive auction that is out there and we haven't. But we firmly believe that as you look long-term, that our greatest shareholder value creation is through that consistent approach of being opportunistic and being disciplined. And when you couple that kind of inorganic growth story that I just outlined there with our best-in-class organic growth story, I think you've got a winning combination in Diamondback and I think that is one that shareholders ought to be proud to own. Jeffrey R. Connolly: All right, thanks guys. I will hop back in the queue. Travis D. Stice: All right. Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Global Hunter Securities. Your line is open. Mike D. Kelly: Hey, guys good morning. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Mike. Mike D. Kelly: I am looking at slide four of your most recent slide deck here and just looking at your inventory count by area and by zone. And if I look at the Wolfcamp B, you have got 316 net locations laid out. And I was just curious how many of those locations come from the Southwest Dawson County acreage? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: I think there was 42 Wolfcamp B locations that we had in Dawson, so 42 out of that 316. Mike D. Kelly: Okay, great. So not that much. Thanks. And then maybe just sticking on the theme of organic versus inorganic growth there, Travis and maybe I think it would be helpful for me to hear what you deem as accretive here and just that balance between \u2013 do we add inventory at the end of a 10+ year inventory life right now versus really just breaking out production growth on a net adjusted per share basis today? How you think about that, what really is accretive for shareholders? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yes, Mike, it is not really the inorganic or organic, it is not really an either/or but it is really an and. We have got to be able to effectively do both and when we look at accretive acquisitions or we look at metrics that describe an accretive acquisition, it is things like EBITDA per share production reserves, those type parameters in usually not all of them will hit so it becomes our strategic judgment that I work with the Board on exactly which of these typically migrate to the top which make these acquisitions accretive. But at the end of the day, it is typically EBITDA per share is what we are looking for. And then also just from an operations metric, F&D costs is another good one that we look at being accretive on an F&D perspective. Mike D. Kelly: Got it. And I know you can't talk too much about Viper here if at all, but just wonder if you look across the basin right now, do you see other opportunities to pick up mineral rights and maybe do something similar that you have done here after picking these mineral rights up eight months ago? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: You bet. Mike, I think I have been on the record several times at least from my perspective that the mineral acquisitions like the one we did in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter of last year was a once in a lifetime opportunity. So I think that is probably still a likely perspective to take at least in terms of large producing minerals like what we were able to acquire. But are there other opportunities to smaller bits and pieces of royalties and minerals? That is certainly what we are going to continue to look for. We have added bits and pieces along the way even since we did the original minerals acquisition. We are going to continue to try to be acquisitive on that front as well as just the more traditional producing property acquisitions. Mike D. Kelly: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One. Your line is open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thanks good morning everyone. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Richard. Richard Merlin Tullis : Travis, just sticking with the M&A theme, you guys have made a lot of progress lowering well costs, operating costs as you move forward. What do you think the capacity is right now for the organization to how many more rigs could you operate and still maintain your current efficiencies if you were to continue with M&A? Travis D. Stice: That\u2019s a great question, Richard, and that is one as an executive team we struggle with quite a bit because I feel that a question earlier on accretive \u2013 how define accretive acquisitions in one of the things that that is not a hard and fast metric that we look at but it is one that we have to consider is if we do an acquisition, can we ensure to our stockholders that that acquisition is not going to dilute our current execution efficiencies. So while I look to Jeff White, our VP of Operations, and Mike Hollis, our VP of Drilling specifically to make sure that as we talk about acquisitions that they can continue to execute on a best-in-class fashion with rolling in the new acquisitions. And so what we have charged each other with is that we need to build an organization that is scalable and that means that we can maintain the current best-in-class execution and at the same time pick up additional rigs. Kind of as a planning number somewhere around that eight to 10 horizontal rigs would be sort of our bandwidth and we are at five right now. So that is how we are building the organization out right now is to try to handle an eight to 10 horizontal rig capacity. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thank you. That is helpful. Just lastly from me, I don't want to get into the details of your proposed transaction as you have mentioned, but could you talk a little bit about expected timing, when you think the transaction could be finalized? Travis D. Stice: Sure, Richard, if you kind of through some of the details in the S-1 which I did last night you will see that we actually filed confidentially, month and half ago \u2013 month and half or so and with actually gone through one cycle with the SEC and that\u2019s where we add right now we are in a quite period because its refiled it now publically with the SEC and we are somewhat limited by how quickly they turn the document but since we have already gone through one turn, if we are somewhere in that 30 to 60 day timeframe I think that would be reasonable expectation. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Ryan Oatman with SunTrust. Your line is open. Ryan Oatman : Hi, good morning. Travis D. Stice: Hi, good morning Ryan. Ryan Oatman : A large Permian operator was discussing the potential for cost inflation of about 10% seemingly across the Board whether it be for labor, rigs or completions. I just wanted to see if you guys were seeing that same type of upward pressure and if you could comment on the broader service environment? Travis D. Stice: Yes, I think in the macro sense, you are going to see a timing of services if everyone actually delivers on the increase in horizontal rigs, that they are talking about, you know you are going to see a massive infustion of horizontal rig activity here in the Permian in the second half for the year. So when you see that even other still idled hydraulic horsepower being moved into the Permian, I think you are going to see a tightening on tightening an outside of the business specifically. I don\u2019t can get into I don\u2019t understand how to predict very clearly what the futures are going to hold what I have challenge the organization with is that any increase in the cost of goods and services that could potential materialize in the second half of the year. Lets plan on offsetting those costs with continued efficiency gains and so at the end of the day two things can happen either we offset it we maintain our guidance or if we don\u2019t see an increase in the cost of goods and services we\u2019ve actually been able to take out 10% of our cost. So that\u2019s the challenge that is out there in front of organization right now. Ryan Oatman : Okay, that is helpful. And then just a detail oriented question here. Can you remind us your acreage position in Dawson County and the northern part of Martin County as well? Travis D. Stice: Yes, in Dawson County, we've got 6,500 net acres, and in the rest of Martin County \u2013 Adam, do you know how many acres in Martin County Adam Lawlis : We have 4,500 net in the original acquisition and then we added the East (indiscernible) stuff, which is another 4,500 in Southeast Martin maybe another 1,000 bolt on in addition to that. Travis D. Stice: So about 10,000 in Martin County. And about, Ryan, in the Northeast Andrews County, we've got about 9,000 acres up there. Ryan Oatman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And can you remind me, is this the first well that you drilled on either Dawson or Northern Martin County or were some of those other Martin County wells that you mentioned up in that block up there? Travis D. Stice: This is the first well that we have drilled in Dawson County, the Kent County School Lands but we have drilled one and reported on it in our offset data about a month ago, the Maybee Breedlove, that we talked about. And then also the Nail Ranch, both Maybee Breedlove and the Nail Ranch are horizontal Wolfcamp B wells in Martin County. Both exceeding our expectations. Ryan Oatman : Perfect. Travis D. Stice: Both exceeding our expectations. Ryan Oatman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Your line is open. Gail A. Nicholson: Good morning, gentlemen. Can you talk about the differences or any differences that you might be seeing in wells that are flowing naturally longer versus the wells that you are putting on ESP sooner? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Gail, it is a good problem to have and it is really on the Gridiron well is the first well that we have really experienced having where we are over 30 days now and it is still flowing with 700 or 800 pounds of flowing casing pressure. So it has obviously got to be driven by a fundamental engineering principle so we've got better permeability, better pressure, better access to the wellbore as you flow the well back. In a general sense, we don't plan on these wells flowing that long but we are certainly proud of that Gridiron well that has flowed so long. Normally we\u2019ll put these wells on a sub pump within two to three weeks probably at the outside. Gail A. Nicholson: Okay, great. And then just looking at the Wolfcamp B reservoir thickness in Dawson County, how thick is that compared to the thickness of the Wolfcamp B down in the Spanish Trail area? Travis D. Stice: It is a little bit thicker in Dawson County. It's got a few more carbonate stringers in it than what we are typically accustomed to seeing like in Midland County, but in terms of thickness it\u2019s slightly thicker. But up in Dawson County it\u2019s not really as I mentioned earlier, it is not really a thickness issue as much as it appears to be a thermal maturity issue. Gail A. Nicholson: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rowe with Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open. Michael J. Rowe: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering \u2013 you talked about I guess just cost inflation earlier on the service side. I was wondering if you could comment on your thoughts regarding gas processing in the basin and just sort of any constraints that you all foresee on the processing side as you all begin to accelerate in the basin? Travis D. Stice: Well, Michael, I think as we move into areas and develop areas horizontally that were originally developed vertically, you've got infrastructure near-term constraints because you can't move the amount of volumes from these horizontal wells through a gathering system that was designed for vertical wells. So we\u2019ve got to work very closely and have been with our third-party processors to make sure we can get the gas through the plant. Two-thirds or more of my gas is dedicated to a plant that is North Midland called Coronado and they have just recently completed a 100 million a day plant expansion so they've got capacity now. We are just trying to make sure we've got the infrastructure in place to move the gas to the mouth of that plant so that we can get everything processed. So you will continue to see near-term maybe quarter-over-quarter fluctuations of processing constraints. Particularly in the first quarter this year, you've got a lot of plant turnarounds that have been negative on our volume profile but those are more quarter-over-quarter events, not long-term events. So it is one that we have to work very closely with our third-party business partners with to make sure we've got adequate processing capacity and the way we do that is share our plans and volume profiles with them so they can make their plans accordingly. Michael J. Rowe: Okay, that is helpful. Just wanted to see honestly \u2013 you had some great cost savings there in Upton County using the 3-well pad so just wondering if you all had plans to implement any more of these pads elsewhere on your acreage position? Travis D. Stice: Yes, just looking at the drilling schedule right now, Michael, we\u2019ve got two more in front of us that are 3-well pads. And then, we\u2019ve got a large series of 2-well pads in front of us as well too. So we\u2019ve got a five rig fleet right now, horizontal rig fleet right now and three of those rigs are capable of walking from well to well and that is where some of those cost savings come in. So we look in the second half of this year for the majority of our wells to be drilled on 2-well and 3-well pad. Michael J. Rowe: Great. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Joseph Reagor with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Joe G. Reagor: Good morning, guys. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Looking at the current availability of funds, you have roughly I guess about $340 million between cash and the upgraded revolver. What is your thoughts as far as toward the end of the year possibly having room to add additional rigs on the existing acreage? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Joe certainly from a liquidity perspective, we've got that capacity now with our increased revolver. Again, it gets more back to we make a decision not so much based on how much revolver we have but based more strategically on how our inventory looks and how quickly we can get it developed. We actually have a sixth rig coming in the fourth quarter but it\u2019s \u2013 but we have yet to decide whether that is a sixth incremental rig \u2013 will be an incremental rig or will be a replacement for one of the existing rigs and that decision is still going to be dependent upon the strategic outcomes of some of the northern acreage tests. So that is kind of how we think about it, Joe. Joe G. Reagor: On that sixth rig right now would your guidance more reflect it as a replacement or as an incremental? Travis D. Stice: Well, it\u2019s really a push either way. If the rig arrives in November, it will probably get one well drilled so that doesn't have any impact on our guidance. You might get a \u2013 well I won't even say an exit buzz because we probably wouldn't have it completed then. So that rig is scheduled to arrive late October, sometime in November so it is more of a 2015 decision. Joe G. Reagor: And then on your existing acreage, what do you guys think the cap is for number of total rigs running? I know you said eight to 10 through additional acquisitions but if you didn't make additional acquisitions this year, what do you think the cap is there? Travis D. Stice: The way that our acreage is laid out, it is pretty blocky in each specific area and the more blocky it is, the more you could put one rig in each area so in the grand scheme of things, we could keep one rig busy in Martin County, one rig busy in Dawson County, one rig busy in Northeast Andrews County, one to two rigs busy in Midland County and then maybe two rigs busy in our new Martin County acquisition that we did in Southwest Martin County here earlier this year. Joe G. Reagor: So that is kind of a cap of seven or so right now? Travis D. Stice: Yes, and depending on if the lower Spraberry works out in Upton County, that is another rig line down there so that could potentially be the eighth rig. But again, that decision to pick up additional rigs is we\u2019re going to be very disciplined in that process to make that decision so I want to make sure I'm not signaling that we are going to be ramping to eight rigs between now and the end of the year because that is certainly not our expectations. Joe G. Reagor: Okay. And then more of a conceptual question, how are you guys balancing the impact of newer technology on longer reach laterals with well spacing and the dynamics of how those costs are impacted? Travis D. Stice: Well, certainly, Joe, as you look at longer horizontals when you look at the cost efficiency, the capital efficiency, longer horizontals are more cost-effective. I think we have convinced ourselves that is the case and so to the extent our acreage geometry allows us to do that, we are going to drill out to 10,000 feet. The Gridiron well because we had an offset location I think the total measured depth of that well is like 24,000 feet so it\u2019s a really long total horizontal well. And we do that because of the lease geometry and we think that is the most capital efficient way. But there are offsets on longer reach laterals primarily on the completion side. And you are taking risks as you try to complete from 75,000 feet to 10,000 feet in beyond as you pump floods down and you try to perforate \u2013 and higher friction losses on the stimulation so slightly potentially less effective stimulations out on the toe. So these are all things that we watch our own results and we communicate with industry experts as well about kind of what is the leading edge thinking on that. And then specifically to your question on inter-lateral spacing, we are currently testing 660 foot inter-lateral spacing right now and actively watching industry as they test even tighter spacing than that. Joe G. Reagor: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Stephanie. Thanks again everyone for participating today\u2019s call. If you have any questions please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect. And everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time (Operator Instructions) as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s second quarter conference call. Representing Diamondback today are; Travis Stice, CEO; Tracy Dick, CFO; and Russell Pantermuehl, VP of Reservoir Engineering. During this conference call the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can we found in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you all for listening to Diamondback\u2019s second quarter 2014 conference call. Since our last call, we\u2019ve issued an operations update that highlighted our pending leasehold acquisition primarily located in Midland and Glasscock Counties in the core of the Northern Midland Basin, increased our full year production guidance, successfully completed our Southern most test of the lower Spraberry in Upton County and that we have placed on production the best horizontal well on a per lateral foot basis in the Midland Basin. Switching to second quarter results, we continued our production growth by growing volumes over 170% as compared to the second quarter of last year and 32% from the prior quarter. We continue to expect to grow production by nearly 150% in 2014 as compared to 2013. This would mark the second consecutive year of nearly a 150% production growth. Our operating expenses continue to be within guidance, but with nearly 300 gross vertical wells acquired this year. We would expect cost to migrate towards the high end of guidance in the near-term as we optimize these wells consistent with our prior practices. Our low cost structure combined with high ore cuts continues to drive peer-leading cash margins. We have several significant wells in various stages of the development throughout our leasehold in the Midland basin. We drilled our first lower Spraberry well in Martin County, our first Cline well in Dawson County and our first stacked Wolfcamp B, lower Spraberry well offsetting our Gridiron well in Midland County. All are awaiting completion operations to begin in the next several weeks. Additionally, we are testing increased frac density in Midland County on two adjacent 5000 foot lateral wells using our standard 22 stage designs on one and an increased density frac design at 33 stages on the other. Expect further details on these well results in the upcoming quarters. Finally, we've drilled and completed our first three well Wolfcamp B pad in Upton county realized savings of $1.25 million to $1.5 million brining the total drilling and completion cost for all three wells to $15.3 million or $5.1 million per well for 5000 foot lateral our lowest cost to-date. From spud of the first well to TD of the third well operations took 38-days. We are also currently drilling our first three well lower Spraberry pad on our Spanish Trail leased in Midland County. As we continue to increased pad drilling we expect some production lumpiness going forward as we conduct simultaneously operations on pad wells. Adding a final point on execution, we have drilled a 10,000 foot laterals in Upton County with the total measured depth of 19,353 feet in a record 14-days. We've now drilled over 80 horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and I\u2019m pleased we are still setting records. As exciting as the growth story has been and continues to be since our IPO. We are also exited about our growth in 2015 and beyond, we are currently running two horizontal rigs on our Spanish Trail lease in Midland County and one each in Andrews, Martin and Upton counties. We expect to add a six horizontal rig in our existing acreage in early first quarter of 2015, as well as the seventh horizontal rig on our recently acquired acreage. We also plan to add an eighth horizontal rig in the second half of 2015 and we are contemplating to adding ninth in 2016. Turning to well results, our new Lower Spraberry wells in Upton County had a 30-day rated nearly 750 Boe a day from the 6,800 foot lateral on ESP, which is as good or better than our average Wolfcamp B wells in Upton County, setting us for additional years of drilling in this asset area. In Midland County, the Spanish Trail Northwest 25-1 Lower Spraberry had a 30-day rate average rate of 59 barrels a day from 4,400 foot lateral on ESP. We've completed our second successful Clearfork Shale well in Andrews County, with the 30-day average rate of 473 Boe a day from a 7,200 foot lateral, which is 15% to 20% higher than our initial well. Well cost in this Clearfork will trend towards $6 million for 7,500 foot lateral enabling development cost to compete with other investment opportunities in our portfolio. Our second and third Wolfcamp B wells in Northern Midland County posted positive results with the 30-day naturally flowing average of 684 Boe a day combined from an average lateral length of 7,300 feet. These wells typically don\u2019t reached peak production until placed on artificial lift, which we were likely to do this month, early results from these wells or at or above results seen from our initial wells. As a reminder, we report a well results on a two stream basis, while we continue to be active in the acquisition arena. We maintain our disciplined approach to evaluating deals. I have consistently communicated that we will do only accretive deals in each acquisitions evaluated in relation to the stock price, we would receive for financing each opportunity. We firmly believe the greatest long-term shareholder value is created through a consistent application of this discipline, when you couple this strategy with the existing best-in-class execution in organic growth, you have a winning combination with Diamondback. With these comments complete, allow me to turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Travis, and welcome everyone. I\u2019ll provide a quick overview of the financial highlights. Our net income for the second quarter was $27.8 million or $0.54 per diluted share versus net income of $14.5 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the same period in 2013. Adjusted net income for the quarter included a loss on commodity derivatives of $11.1 million and a loss on sale of assets of $1.4 million. Excluding the losses and the related income tax effect are adjusted net income with $35.8 million or $0.70 per diluted share. As previously reported our production for the second quarter was approximately 17,836 boe per day. These volume generated revenues in the second quarter of $127 million compared to $45 million for the same quarter in 2013. Realized pricing for the second quarter before the effective hedges was $78.25 and with the effective hedges it was $76.02. Our average realized oil prices before hedges was $95.90 and with the effective hedges it was $92.20. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $103 million. Turning the cost, our LOE was $6.47 per boe in the second quarter. Our general and administrative cost came in at $2.42 per boe which includes non-cash stock based compensation excluding stock based compensation SG&A cost or $1.73 per boe. Our current hedge position through 2015 have been laid out in our earning release. We currently have about 40% of our estimated crude oil production hedged for the reminder of 2014. We continually affect our hedging opportunity and we intend to continue to layer on additional hedges at our production growth. In the second quarter of 2014 we generated $87 million of operating cash flow and $85 million of discretionary cash flow for $1.70 and $1.66 per diluted respectively. During the second quarter of 2014, we spent $124.1 million for drilling completion and infrastructure. Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately $37 million cash on hand at June 30, 2014 and we had drawn $46 million on our secured revolving facility which had a borrowing base of $350 million. We have subsequently reduced the outstanding balance to zero with a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering in July. I will now turn this call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you Tracy, to summarize we are again adding acreage in the quarter Northern Midland Basin play and we've recently increased production guidance for the second time this year. I'm proud of our continued success in driving production growth, continued improvement executed on these complex well pads and confirming new zones like Lower Spraberry in Upton County include Clearfork Shale in Andrews County. I believe we continue to deliver results and stock holder returns that are among the best in the Midland Basin. Before I open the call for question, I want to acknowledge our employees on all they have accomplished in the first half of this year and especially welcome those employees that are new to Diamondback. On behalf of the board and employees of Diamondback Energy, I would like to thank you for your participation today. This concludes our prepared comments. Operator, please open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David W. Kistler of Simmons & Company. Your may begin. David W. Kistler: Good morning guys. Travis D. Stice: Good morning Dave. David W. Kistler: Real quickly, looking at the Martin County Wolfcamp B results and the Andrews County Clearfork results, can you talk a little bit about what that does or increasing development inventory on a longer term basis and then those might fall in terms of competing for capital as you go forward with development? Travis D. Stice: Sure Dave and thank you. I think in my prepared remarks I actually referenced those Wolfcamp B wells and Midland County and of course they are in Northern Martin County, so I apologize for that misspeak there, but specifically almost Martin County wells now this is the second and third well and we are confirming kind of that reserve target of between 650,000 and 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent and that\u2019s going to place these in that 50% to 60% rate of return. So it\u2019s really time for us to go to work there now. We've got three wells that are spread across the acreage, it really confirms the viability of Wolfcamp B, so I think you know it\u2019s logical to assume that we will partner rig there and really focus on well-to-well efficiencies. Now moving over to the Clearfork Shale in Andrews Count, you know as I mentioned those well costs are going to be around $6 million. I actually think as we get in there with reputable wells we can drive those costs down, but as it sits right now to $6 million well cost that Clearfork Shale is going to be somewhere between 30% and 40% rate of return and you know probably 450,000 to 500,000 boe of oil equivalent basis. And while 30% to 40% rate of return is still a goodwill that certainly doesn\u2019t compare when you look at the plus 70% to almost 100% rate of return included the fact, the minerals we are getting in the county. So we don\u2019t expect just to get out there and just start drilling one well right after another, but we probably got about 50 to depending on spacing you know maybe over 50 locations in the Clearfork Shale, but what I think is more logical is that you will see us early next year, maybe late this year move back into there and drill a two well pad and see if we can get some cost efficiencies on a two well pad and improve the economics there. David W. Kistler: Great I appreciate that and then maybe switching to something a little bit different one of your peers recently contracted or bunch of water sourcing looking forward and talked about what their water needs will be for drilling completions over the next 10-years, obviously in ways away, but can you talk a little bit about how you are handling the water situation right now and how that factors into the rig ramp that you outlined for us getting to kind of 9 rigs plus 16? Travis D. Stice: Sure Dave. What we\u2019ve done is gone through each of our development areas and put in place what we call a water usage plan and that water usage plan is sort of the holistic approach to access, accumulation and disposal of water. And we really got to be effective in addressing each of those three things for each of our asset areas, because once we have a real well laid out strategy for those three items then we go in and put rigs on top of that. And I think we are going to need all sources of stimulation water going forward, whether it\u2019s existing fresh water, Brackish Santa Rosa water or recycled water in order to match our rig need. So it\u2019s an issue that we are paying real close attention to and trying to make sure it\u2019s consistent with our development strategy. David W. Kistler: Great appreciate that and then just as long as we are on things that could be potential bottlenecks going forward. What are the other bottlenecks that kind of concern you as you look at this aggregated portfolio and how you develop it going forward? Travis D. Stice: Well, there is in fact in a journal yesterday there was a nice article on sand and you are seeing more and more sands being used in our industry whether it\u2019s in Eagle Ford or the Bakken and even in our own backyard where we\u2019re talking about increasing 6 million pound job up to 9 million pound job. To the extent that the industry migrates towards more and more sand in these horizontal wells, I think its realistic that we've got to make sure we've got this you know the full supply chain figured out to make sure we and our services companies can access the sand at the time we need it and then between sand and stimulation water those are the two things that I think about. David W. Kistler: Okay great. I really appreciate the clarification. Great work guys. Travis D. Stice: Thank you Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gordon Gouthat of Wells Fargo. You may begin. Gordon Gouthat : Thanks good morning everybody. Just to dough tail off of that last question, so recognizing it\u2019s a bit earlier in the Permian delineation, but there has been a lot of talk recently about evolution and completion design and since you mentioned about increasing prop and how are you thinking about the evolution of your completion designs going forward. Travis D. Stice: Well, Gordon we\u2019ve always continued to tweak our completion designs and always looking for ways to extract more rollout of this rock at a competitive price. Just as an aside, I know there's a lot of communication in the industry now about the effective slick water fracs. Well, we did our first horizontal well over two years ago down in Upton County, as one of the first operators to start drilling horizontal wells in areas that have are predominantly drilled vertically. And that first horizontal well was slick water job and that's really and we've got over 80 of them completed and I think 79 of them have had slick water frac or applied to it. So we continue to tweak sand per foot, water per foot and in this most recent test we're going to try to hold as many variables constant as we can and just increase the number of stages across the lateral and that's that 22 stage going up to 33 stage and we're doing it on a sister well. So it's a pad well and one well with 22 stages and then just immediately over we'll do the next well with 33 stages and we think that will give us the best way to measure our improvement. It\u2019s about $3 million more pounds of sand. It's probably going to cost us about a million barrels, but if we can pick up a little more than million dollars, if we can pick up about 10,000 more barrels on EUR, it will probably pay for it. So just look for us to provide more color as we go forward. Gordon Gouthat : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a question Travis, you mentioned in your comments at prepared remarks that the rig allocation this year and as you had rig next year I'm just wondering how you look to allocate those rigs across the various areas of your position? Travis D. Stice: Yes, you know we talked in our operations about a couple of weeks ago about on the newly acquired acreage and we think we'll have a rig-and-a-half on that new acreage. So there's 1.5 rigs there, the other rigs \u2013 we're going to try to keep as many rigs as we can in our Spanish Trail acreage where Diamondback owns 93% of the minerals there now. We'll try to keep this many there; we\u2019ll keep one rig down in Upton County that\u2019s why I was extracted about this new Lower Spraberry well that gives us some good opportunities there. One of our competitors talked about a nice Cline result down in Upton County as well, which we haven't testified, but obviously we'll pay close attention to there. So, two- three Midland County, two-three in the Northern blocks, one and half in our newly acquired acreage and one or so down south, will get you kind of into that 7.5, 8 rig cadence. Gordon Gouthat : Okay, and then, under that program, any preliminary thoughts on how the growth profile would trend? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Gordon we've not signaled yet what our 2015 is going to be. I think we have a November call scheduled and that's when we'll have a more fulsome discussion on 2015. Gordon Gouthat : Okay, thanks a lot guys. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Gordon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. You may begin. Michael D. Kelly: Thanks guys good morning. Travis, I was hoping you can talk about the opportunity set for Viper you guys are really kind of first mover here with throwing the mineral rates and MLP. I was just hoping if you could talk about that and then also curious if there is beyond just being a 92% owner of Vennum, is there is any other added benefits that might not be obvious for FANG\u2019s holders having that MLP in place. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yes, thanks Mike, you know really on the Viper side, the councils advised me to not be speaking too publicly about this step of our acquisitions. I can tell you in a general sense I have been really pleased with the amount of opportunities we've already had in the first 30-days and I think just look forward to providing more color on Viper in our upcoming calls. On this specifically again we laid out the benefits to Diamondback pretty clearly during our IPO on Viper and I think you can just refer back to our Viper webpage and you can see all of those details. Michael D. Kelly: Okay that\u2019s fair enough and then with Viper, is there desire to go outside of the Permian and look for deals and does that ultimately \u2013 bang is obviously very Midland focused talk about ramping to nine rigs there. Does that ultimately lead you to want to take Diamondback outside in the Permian as well? Travis D. Stice: You bet. Thanks Mike. Well specifically on Viper as we talked about during the IPO. I mean Viper is not constrained to the Midland basin, obviously Diamondback is laser focused on execution results in the Midland basin, but the Viper level we are looking for accretive deal in all of the other basin and the three kind of criteria we are looking for are basins are actively being developed, oil weighted basins and the operator that\u2019s developing the minerals is a confident operators. So those are kind of the three broad focus items that we look at when we start screening deals for Viper. Michael D. Kelly: Great thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question if from Jason Wangler of Wunderlich. You may begin. Jason A. Wangler: Good morning guys. Just curious as far as you talked a lot about just different infrastructure and bottlenecks, just curious on the frac side as you are seeing that one obviously you keep ramping the rig count, the plan is to ramp it further later this year this year and next. What are you seeing as far as frac and as far as the contracts that you may have now or what you may have to look at as you go forward? Travis D. Stice: Yes, we are continuing to see some cost pressures from the pressure pumping side of the business one of the things that\u2019s we\u2019re pleased with is that we\u2019ve got two dedicated crews working for us right now. And, we\u2019ve got roughly 40 or so wells to complete in the second half of this year and all those 40, roughly 30 of them will be on pads and you know the efficiencies that I talked about in my prepared remarks on the cost side a lot of that comes on a stimulation side, because you have just got \u2013 you set a crew right down the location and get two or three wells at one time and so. I'm still trying to do everything I can to hold the line of cost and offset any increases in costs with improved efficiencies, but I do think that the tension is getting pretty tight now. We\u2019ve got two dedicated crews as I mentioned and we\u2019re looking at maybe bringing a three dedicated crew on later this year, early in the first quarter. One other things that the stimulation companies have communicated to us is that they really like working for Diamondback Energy, because even though like right now we\u2019re just running five rigs, it\u2019s really equivalent to running \u2013 working for another company that\u2019s running eight or nine of 10 rigs, because of how fast we get these wells drilled. So, it really builds a nice inventory of wells that they can just move to very quickly and that help efficiency on their side and it helps own our cost side as well. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe just on the other side of it, as you get the oil out I know that you are always focused on the take away, how are you seeing that market playing out, I think it was a little bit differential issues somewhat in the quarter at one point with the refinery down, but how are you seeing that market playing out so far? Russell D. Pantermuehl: We know that there is serve large pipelines that are ready to either start filling or we\u2019ll hear shortly in the second half of this year that the differential blowout that occurred to couple of weeks ago and month ago will come back into more traditional trading levels on the Mid-Cush differential. We are continuing to look at space that\u2019s available on these other pipelines that are leaving the Permian that are not going to Cushing, Oklahoma and just as a reminder we've got 8,000 barrels a day gross that we've already committed and are moving right now on the Magellan Longhorn pipeline and we received the LLS pricing for that. Pricing for that. So, any incremental barrels above 8,000 barrels a day have been subjected to that Mid-Cush differential, but at least we've got a little insurance for our stock holders on 8,000 barrels a day and we're looking to get more space on pipelines away from Cushing, Oklahoma to try to address that issue. Unidentified Analyst : Great, I\u2019ll turn it back. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Connolly with Mizuho Securities. You may begin. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, production might be a little lumpy due to a lot of wells on pads. Can you give us any color on the completion schedule in the third and fourth quarter that might help us model production? Travis D. Stice: Yes, as I was just talking with Jason there I think we got 40 well that we've kind of scheduled between now and the end of the year and with two full dedicated crews right now, it ought to be in that 20ish wells per quarter. And again, you know, we've got to have a little flexibility in that. But in order to get our annual guidance of wells completed, we need knob that 20 wells per quarter and that\u2019s where we've got laid out right now. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Travis thank enough helpful I will jump back in the queue that\u2019s it from me. Travis D. Stice: Thanks Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Willis Fitzpatrick of Johnson Rice. You may begin. Willis Fitzpatrick : Good morning. I know that you guys hit on this a little bit, but the majority of yours wells going forward should be on at least two well pads. Can you talk about any potential to accelerate or to make those three or even more wells per pad and then also the availability of walking rigs where you are? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Yes. I\u2019ll answer those in reverse, the walk-in rigs, we try to have about half or three quarter of our rig fleet available that walk from well-to-well. For example that three well pad that we talked about down in Upton County that rig was set up with walk-in fee and it moved from well-to-well in less than eight hours. It typically takes us two and half days to move a rig and so on a three well pad we moved them in eight hours. And about a half to three quarters of our rig fleet will be set out to do that. We also because we still are geographically diverse, you know, we need to have these rigs that are quick to move a minimum number of loads and then can move from area-for-area and so I can't have all of my rig fleet that are set up with feet because I need those fast moving rigs. So out of the \u2013 and I\u2019ll look to Mike here real quick, but out of the six rigs we'll have it at the end of this year Mike, how many of those will be set up with the rig feet. Michael L. Hollis: You have four rigs with walk-in feet and you'll have two that are H and P rigs that are quick movers and rig release spud times, you're looking into 2.5 to 2.8 days to for the HMP rigs and a full pad with walking feet to move from pad-to-pad is about 3.5 days from one of the big 1500 horse rigs with the feet. And then as Travis mentioned between wells, it's about eight hours. Actually spud, rig release to spud will run you a little about 0.8 days or a pad when we can when we can walk the rig from one to the next. Russell D. Pantermuehl: Thank you, Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Yes. Willis Fitzpatrick : Perfect And then just one more sort of in the same vein, it seems like those cost savings per well were a little higher than expected, but should we think about that as generally shifting toward the lower end of the 9.6 to 7.4 complete the well cost range or should we think a bit it\u2019s actually shifting that range? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Well, I wish that I could tell you that shifting to range lower what I think it may end up doing is offsetting some of the cost increases that we're seeing. So at this point I don't want to signal that we're going to be lowering the range on per well completions. Willis Fitzpatrick : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Reagor of ROTH Capital Partners. You may begin. Joseph G. Reagor: Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one key point is with all the water supply issues that have been going on in many of the basins, how are you guys, planning ahead for this with the additions of up to three more rigs over the next 18-months? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Well, Joe, I talked a few minutes ago about our water usage plan for each area and a little bit more detail on that when it comes to access and accumulation that means it's the number of fresh water or Brackish water wells that we drilled in advance of the drilling rig arriving and it also means we\u2019ve got the size appropriately our storage frac pits for these types of water. So, that\u2019s what we are doing, we are on the newly acquired acreage, we are rapidly coming up with the water usage plans that gets all the way to how prolific the Brackish water wells are and how prolific the fresh water wells are and then what size frac pumps we need to accommodate our rig schedule. I think I had a previous question about increasing from two to three well pads and ideally we would like to stay with three well pads, but some of that hinges on our ability to accumulate water and also lateral link as well too. The longer laterals also require obviously more stimulation fluids. So it takes a little longer to accumulate that amount of stimulation fluid. Joseph G. Reagor: Okay. And do you guys have an idea of what kind of relative cost inflation impact the water supply situation has had on your guys over say the last 12-months? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Yes, I wouldn't say that the water supply has impacted the cost. What I would say is that it's more on the pressure pumping side, the hydraulic horsepower charges that we're seeing or working their way up. Really the only difference on the stimulation fluid is that when we drill these Brackish wells, they're a couple of $100,000 a piece as oppose to a fresh water well, which is $10,000 to $20,000a piece. Joseph G. Reagor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you. Thanks again to everyone participating in today\u2019s call. If you have any question please reach out us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I'll now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Candice. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joined third quarter conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on our Web site. Representing Diamondback today Travis Stice, CEO; Tracy Dick, CFO; as well as other members of our executive team. During this conference call the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can we found in the company's filings with the SEC. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures to GAAP in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you all for listening to Diamondback's and Viper Energy Partners third quarter 2014 conference call. The horizontal shale revolution has resulted in tremendous growth in oil production especially here in the Permian Basin. Diamondback has drilled over a 100 horizontal wells in the last two years and I'm proud of the role Diamondback has played in the Midland basin. As we have experienced in the past, the service sector has responded to this production growth and increased activity with increasing costs while at the same time, we have experienced a marked declined in commodity prices. Diamondback has never been about growth for growth sake rather we have always sought a line our stockholders with our strategy of returns and cash flow growth. Our stockholders have been rewarded by investing in a company that consistently delivers the highest cash flow margin with the lowest cost and expense structure, best execution and capital discipline. We will enter 2015 running five horizontal rigs consistent with previously stated plans. But, if commodity prices haven't improved or service costs have not declined Diamondback will respond by drilling fewer wells in 2015 than initially anticipated. However, we intended to continue to run two horizontal rigs on our Spanish Trail acreage consistent with guidance from Viper Energy Partners. Our decision to maintain or possibly reduce our current rig count rather than increase it as previously contemplated which I call are deferred acceleration plan will be based on our goal of maximizing return on capital and minimizing debt until we can get a more attractive rate of return on our assets for our stockholders. I want to emphasize that the quality of our inventory is the best it has ever been in our history. In 2014, we added nearly 600 gross horizontal locations in prime positions in the North Central Midland basin. We are able to maintain our leases with the one or two rig program. Under this deferred acceleration plan Diamondback expects to become cash flow positive during the second half of 2015 further strengthening on already strong balance sheet with minimal leverage. If we choose to defer acceleration, we will be preserving high rate of return horizontal wells for better market conditions and Diamondback will be in a better position to flex its strong balance sheet to make accretive acquisitions or to resume inventory acceleration when better market conditions return, which we believe they will. Since Diamondback owns roughly 88% of Viper Energy Partners, we also have the unique ability to use Viper as a liquidity vehicle if needed. Dating back to before its IPO, Diamondback has had a consistent strategy of managing the company by exercising capital discipline and allocation of resources. Now, I will focus on specific operational details from the quarter, I will be referring to the updated company presentation found on our Web site. During the third quarter, Diamondback continued its production growth by growing volumes of 178% as compared to the third quarter of last year and up 16% from the prior quarter. This significant ramp in production year-over-year would not have been possible without approximately 90% of our CapEx expand dedicated to horizontal development. We continue to expect Diamondback to grow production by nearly 150% in 2014 as compared to last year. This would market the second consecutive year of nearly 150% production growth. As reported last month, Viper realized an increase in production of 39% from the prior quarter. A large component of Diamondback's success is attributed to drilling the Wolfcamp B shale. Of the approximately 105 horizontal wells drilled since we began almost 90 have targeted the Wolfcamp B, which really encouraging from the testing we have done to-date is that the Lower Spraberry appears to be outperforming the Wolfcamp B across our acreage. We have always said that the Spraberry is not only the most continuously deposited but that it also contains the most oil in place. Slide 7 shows a table of Diamondback's Lower Spraberry wells to-date. In Midland County, the Spanish Trail Northwest 2507 Lower Spraberry recorded a peak 30-day rate of 1405 boe's a day from 5257 foot lateral. This translates into 267 boe's a day per 1000 foot of completed lateral, which rivals the Gridiron Wolfcamp B well we discussed last quarter as one of the best wells in the Midland basin. 30 miles further north in Martin County, we completed the Mabee Breedlove 2301 Lower Spraberry with the peak 30-day rate of 779 boe's a day from a 6454 foot lateral. We believe this well is the northern most publicly reported test of the shale. As reported last quarter, the Neal F unit number 6 Lower Spraberry well in Upton County, the industries first Lower Spraberry horizontal test in the county had a peak 30-day rate of 743 boe's per day from 6800 foot lateral. This well is over 50 miles south of the Spanish Trail acreage. The distance from our acreage in Northern Martin County to Upton County is over 80 miles illustrating the tremendous potential of this Lower Spraberry deposition. When you refer to Slide 8, most of our current results are significantly outperforming our 650,000 boe two stream Lower Spraberry type curve and we are optimistic that this success can be replicated across a larger portion of our acreage. On Slide 9, we show stratigraphically how the Lower Spraberry looks across our acreage position. Login core analyzes indicate fairly consistent reservoir quality in the Lower Spraberry shale from Southwest Dawson County extending South onto our Upton County assets. Slide 10 shows other notable results from the quarter including Diamondback's first operated stacked lateral test in the Wolfcamp B in Lower Spraberry in Midland County. From the Gridiron number one and the Gridiron number two Lower Spraberry. The Wolfcamp B well is still flowing naturally a lot of Lower Spraberry well is on ESP. The two wells have a combined rate to-date of nearly 3000 boe's a day from two laterals that average just shy of 9200 feet. Briefly switching gears to Viper development of Spanish Trail is a win-win for both entities as Spanish Trail is the most economic prospect in Diamondback's portfolio. In continued organic production growth is expected for both Diamondback and Viper. As a reminder, Viper's mineral barrel has no direct operating their capital expenditures associated with it. Slide 14 illustrates the difference between mineral interest and working interest operating margins. We continue to have best-in-class low operating expenses among our peers in the Permian basin. But, with nearly 300 gross vertical wells acquired this year, we have seen an upward migration in least operating expenses. We fully expect this trend to reverse as we optimize these wells consistent with our low cost efficient practices. Slide 6 shows that while our LOE per barrel of oil equivalent was $7.27 during the quarter, it would have been $6.19 after excluding the effect of the acquired properties. We are reiterating our LOE guidance for the year between $6 and $7 a barrel. Our low cost structure combined with high oil cuts continued to drive peer leading cash margins and you can see graphically on Slide 5 performance relative to our peers and the positive historical trend. With these comments complete, allow me to turn the call over to Tracy. Tracy Dick : Thank you, Travis. Diamondback had a nice quarter. Our net income for the quarter was $43.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share. After adjusting our third quarter earnings for net commodity derivative gain $14.9 million and netting out the related income tax effect, our adjusted net income was $34 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Our production for the third quarter was approximately 20,636 boe a day. These volumes generated revenues in the third quarter of $130 million volumes up almost 16% and revenues up over 9% from the prior quarter. Our average realized price before the effective hedges for the third quarter was $73.28 per boe and our average realized price including the effective hedges for the third quarter was $72.48. Diamondback's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $111.1 million that is up about 8% from the prior quarter. Turning to cost our LOE was $7.27 per boe in the third quarter. As Travis mentioned excluding the effect of recent acquisition LOE for the quarter would have been $6.19. We do anticipate that our LOE for the year will be in the upper end of our guidance of between $6 and $7. Our general and administrative cost came in at $3.42 per boe for the third quarter. This includes non-cash equity based compensation excluding all of our equity compensation G&A costs are $2.33 per boe. The $9 spread includes non-cash equity issuances from Viper Energy Partners of $0.47 with the remainder attributable to Diamondback. We also have laid out our details of our current hedge position in last night's earnings release. We currently have about 9000 barrels a day hedged at approximately $95 for the remainder of 2014. We also have over 10,000 per day hedged in 2015 for approximately $88. In the third quarter of 2014, we generated $92.3 million of operating cash flow and $97.1 million of discretionary cash flow or $1.66 and $1.75 per diluted share respectively. During the third quarter of 2014, we spent $103.3 million for drilling completion and infrastructure. Additionally, we spent approximately $528 million on lease-hold acquisition which we primarily funded with the equity offering closed back in July. As we look ahead to the end of the year we expect our calendar year drilling and development capital to fall at the upper end of our guidance of between $425 million and $475 million. As of September 30th, we had drawn $140 million on our secured revolving credit facility. Our agent lender approved a borrowing base increase of 114% to $750 million. We have elected to limit this commitment to $500 million which provides us a plenty of liquidity. We estimate our year end debt to EBITDA will be less than 2x. I will turn briefly to Viper Energy Partners, which announced last night a cash distribution of $0.25 per unit for the period from June 23rd through September 30, 2014. During the period, adjusted EBITDA was $21.4 million and production increased 39% quarter-over-quarter to 3400 boe per day. Viper has no debt and an undrawing revolver of $110 million following the September 2014 public offering. With my comments complete, I will turn it back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Tracy. To summarize, we have continued validating the enormous stack to pay potential here in the Permian basin by developing the Lower Spraberry. Earlier Lower Spraberry results appeared to be even better than the Wolfcamp B which notably has driven the tremendous success Diamondback has achieved during the past couple of years. We maintain our laser like focus on well cost and expenses and continue to deliver cash margins per barrel and low expenses at the top of our peer group. We will monitor market conditions closely as we enter into 2015 and are prepared to implement our plan to defer acceleration if warranted consistent with our practice of capital discipline becoming cash flow positive next year under a deferral plan with a strong balance sheet would put Diamondback in a very favorable position to capitalize on opportunities or to resume inventory acceleration under better market conditions. I believe we continue to deliver results and stockholder returns that are among the best in the industry. Before I call for questions, I want to acknowledge our employees for all they have accomplished so far this year and especially welcome those employees that are new to Diamondback. We crossed our two year anniversary as a public company in October and I want to thank each of the almost 100 employees of Diamondback for their contribution to our success. It has been an amazing ride since taken the company public in 2012 and I firmly believe our best is yet to come. Operator, please open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Mark Lear of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Mark Lear : Hey, good morning guys, great quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks Mark. Mark Lear : Just wanted to just touch on some of the comments in the press release from you guys on CapEx in 2015, I know it's early, others have just made comments about well cost and looking for cost to come lower and clearly the outlook for oils pretty uncertain. But just, any commentary you can give around rig assumptions, what you might be doing, clearly some great results in the Lower Spraberry, would you likely be high-grade again drilling a lot more Lowe Spraberry wells in the low price environment, just a color around that would be great. Travis Stice : Sure, Mark. Let me kind of take those in reverse. Specifically to the Lower Spraberry, we got a half a dozen or so well results that are significantly outperforming our type curve and obviously, that outperformance drives better rates of returns for our investors as well. So while we have not finalized our plans in 2015, it makes a lot of sense for us to try to emphasize development of Lower Spraberry. Specifically the rig count and cadence for next year, I know that's an important question a lot of analysts' mantra and now understand why you guys need to have an answer to that. But specifically to rigs, I want to remind our audience that that rigs are part of the equation but because we drill so many more wells on an annual basis than most of our competitors, it's really about wells next year. And we've got some optionality as we look into 2015 to pin in our market conditions on how many wells that we are going to drill. And I've tried to outline that as best we understand it right now. But, we got to see service cost need to be recalibrated in conjunction with commodity products has declined $25 or $30 a barrel in the last 100 days. So we've got to get better clarity on what those two events are going to look like before we finalize our plans into 2015. And then lastly Mark, we've got a Board meeting early December where I will be outlining specifically all of these different options that are still in front of us in 2015. Mark Lear : That's great. Really helpful. I mean I guess when you are looking at particularly Lower Spraberry performance outperforming the type curve, I mean I know you have also talked about Wolfcamp B performance similarly outperforming, how would you say at this stage Wolfcamp B wells are tracking versus type curve as well? Travis Stice : Yes. I think if you go back in Investor presentation in the appendix section, we've got some updated performance curves in there. But, I will say in general sense, we are pleased in the outcome of the Wolfcamp B wells whether at or above our current type curve performance. Russell is going to sit down with Ryder Scott here at the end of the year and we will go through the technical exchange with the reserve auditors and then following that reconciliation we will be able to update type curve not only the lower \u2013 not only the Wolfcamp B but also and perhaps even more importantly the Lower Spraberry. Mark Lear : It's great. And just to looking back up to 2015 as \u2013 just kind of thinking about how you try and delineate some of the other layers next year, are you still kind of looking to peers to do a lot of that work for you or do you expect to do some more client drilling other zones as well? Travis Stice : Yes, Mark. I think you've always heard us talk about being fast followers and the industry is real good about putting forth publicly the results in different zones. So I think that's certainly a prudent approach for our signs as to let the other \u2013 that our peers do a lot of drilling in these other zones. I think certainly under the deferred acceleration plan that I referenced that would be really focused on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B. If we were to accelerate our inventory at the other end of the spectrum, you might see us in the second half of the year perhaps testing the Wolfcamp A. But as it stands right now Mark, we really like the results we are seeing in the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp B. Mark Lear : That's great. Thanks a lot Travis. Travis Stice : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Amoss of Iberia Capital. Your line is now open. David Amoss : Hi. Good morning guys. Travis Stice : Morning, David. Tracy Dick : Hey there. David Amoss : Just one quick from me, Travis, if you don't mind can you kind of go into a little bit more detail on what the cost trend you are seeing from \u2013 what are the services guys putting in front of you for 2015 today that we sort of magnitude? And then what do you need to see before you get \u2013 get more bullish on service cost and possibly consider going up on the rig count again even in a lower commodity environment? Travis Stice : Yes, David. That again is a pretty complicated question. I can you tell that probably year-to-date on the service side, we are seeing cost in some portions of our business up as high as 20%. I know that prior to this recent pull back some of the service sector was even trying to push through on another 10% increase on top of that effect first of the year. So that would be on some aspects of our business, the cost increase of almost 30% year-over-year while at the same time our commodity prices off $25 or $30 a barrel. So there is not a number that I can really give you that says hey, it's got to come down to this. And then I will get back to work because it's really a function of not only well results like Mark was asking me about, it's also where the service costs are ultimately going to be recalibrated with this oil price. And understandably it goes up very, very fast, cost of goods and services and understandably it comes down a little bit slower and that's what we are seeing around now. So we are communicating with all of our business partners across the full spectrum to ask them to make sure that they are looking at their side of the business as well as ours in response to a low commodity price. So it's really a combination of a bunch of different factors that will dictate future plans for Diamondback. David Amoss : And just one follow-up, I mean, are there components of that service cost where you are seeing the substantial amount more inflation than others, what are the \u2013 I guess the biggest concerns going into next year? Travis Stice : Well, if you look at the pressure pumping side of the business and certainly not just to single out one aspect of our total spend because we look at the full spectrum. But pressure pumping through the years probably been the single most \u2013 single biggest spend increase. But closely behind that you are seeing cost of rigs grow up as well. So when you look at pressure pumping and drilling rigs those are pretty \u2013 too big pretty large tickets on a well. David Amoss : Really appreciate it. Great quarter guys. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Kelly : Good morning. Travis Stice : Hi. Good morning, Mike. Mike Kelly : Yes, Travis. You guys posted a great production number in Q3, looks like you are now well ahead of the midpoint of your full year guidance, so that 17,000 to 19,000 a day. So wondering if there is anything in Q4 that we should be aware of maybe makes you reluctant to, to increase that range. I know you guys have been in no other transition to more pad drilling if that's it or are you guys just being conservative here? Thanks. Travis Stice : You bet, Mike. If you look specifically into fourth quarter, we continue to migrate most of our wells towards pad drilling. And we always like we communicated during the third quarter, we are going to see interference when we do these pad wells in areas where we have got multiple wells already in the section. So while I feel confident about the fourth quarter, the reality is that we are drilling a lot of wells in sections where we already have existing wells. And we just got to be careful as put guidance out there on an annual basis that we always confident that we will be able to deliver on our promises. Mike Kelly : All right. Fair enough. And this might be more hypothetical or academic in nature, but with the strong margins get into the point of being free cash flow positive. Can you talk about I don't know if you have done this exercise internally what's up with growth rate, do you think it actually being able to run at if you were free cash flow positive? Travis Stice : Yes. And Mike certainly I've not even communicated that to my Board yet. So we do have internal models, but again, if you look at the \u2013 you look at what goes into a model whether its cost of goods and services, which I have already talked haven't yet recalibrated. The price for commodity which is very difficult to predict in our business and then those success of the wells, all three of those things have very significant impacts on our ability to be cash flow positive next year. What I do like about is that our lease hold position can be maintained with minimal drilling next year. So that just gives us a lot of optionality as we look into 2015 and again, I know you guys have a need for specificity. But at this point there is just too many parameters out there that we are not comfortable rolling out 2015 guidance until probably early in the first quarter of next year when we got better clarity on market conditions. Mike Kelly : Got it, understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Just one question from me. Given that the stack laterals looks like pretty good results through this quarter and then also some reduced cluster spacing or some tighter stage spacing on a couple of wells there. Just wondering how those two things would factor into your program going forward. I know its volatile environment on the commodity pricing side. But, what do you take away from those two things and how much that factor in going forward. Travis Stice : True. Well, again, depending on how many wells we are going to drill in 2015 that would be influenced by how many stack laterals we end up drilling. I think you see efficiencies, cost efficiencies which you know we are all about, you see cost efficiencies when you are doing two and three well pads primarily on the pressure pumping side, the stimulation side. We think it that's the best way to maximize returns. With that being said though, we still got look at Wolfcamp B development timely in sections where we already have two and three wells in there. So again, it's a very fluid way that we look at the business next year because we got to make sure we are not fracing at the same time, we are drilling well in the section. Switching to the second part of your question the increase frac stages, I guess if you look at the IP30 data that we've showed in the company presentation, I was a little surprised that we didn't see a more marked increase early on. I think it's like most tests, more data, more time certainly helps to provide greater clarity. But I think or even to further complicate in a good way that response is that if you look at those two wells they are among the best two Wolfcamp B wells that we drilled. And so now we are trying to figure out the fact that we put 4 million pounds of sand -- more pounds of sand and more stimulation fluid in that little section, did that perhaps influence why these two wells are so much better than their offset. So it's a good problem to have but its one we are going to need more time to before we provide any clarity both internally and externally. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp of Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Grampp : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Travis just to go back on that increased rack density test and obviously understanding it's a little bit hard to draw any definitive conclusions yet. Do you guys have any thing currently planned or drilling to test that in the near future or how should we think about integrating those types of projects in the near term here? Travis Stice : Yes. Jeff, I think you wait for me to give you some more specifics about which wells we are going to able to try that again. Certainly I think it's prudent based on the early kind of \u2013 early two well improved performance for us to try that again. But I don't want to give a specific shed on which wells that we're trying on but I think it's reasonable that in the next couple of quarters you will see some more results from increased sand and fluid stimulation across our asset base. And again, that also kind of toss back into how many wells we are going to drill next year. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Fair enough. And then just kind of thinking about the recent acquisitions you guys did the Glasscock and Reagan county acreage. How should we think about you guys integrating those assets given that the rig counts probably not going to be ramping as aggressively into 2015? Travis Stice : Well, again, I'm trying to stay away specifically from counting rigs into 2015. But in a general sense that previously communicated we will keep two horizontal rigs running in the Spanish Trial on the Viper acreage. And then depending on how many wells we ultimately end up next year, we drilled the more wells, we drilled the high likelihood will have additional wells drilled in Glasscock and Midland county on that newly acquired acreage. The less number of wells we drilled would probably also correspond to fewer wells drilled on the newly acquired acreage. So again, it's kind of a fluid situation based on a lot of different parameters that we are trying to dial-in right now. And unfortunately we don't have to make the decision on November 5 that we look forward to provide more clarity early in 2015 and what it looks like. Jeff Grampp : Okay. And then if I can just ask one more maybe switching over to the Viper side, can you guys comment at all on recent deal flow and maybe what you guys are seeing there and maybe if things are loosening up with obviously oil price is coming down, do you guys anticipate maybe being a bit more aggressive on the acquisition front? Travis Stice : We continue to be very opportunistic on deals on the Viper side. But, I will tell you that the most of the royalty checks haven't reflected yet the lower declining commodity price. I think there is going to be a little bit of time before royalty owner start seeing lower $75 WTI prices placed in the royalty check. So I think while I've been pleased with the opportunity set. I think between now and upcoming months with lower commodity prices, we hope to be seeing more opportunities come our way. Jeff Grampp : Okay. It sounds like a great result guys. That's it for me. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Michael of Miller Tabak. Your line is now open. Adam Michael : Hi, guys. I wanted to see if I could \u2013 if you are trying to do a little bit of sensitivity analysis going forward. What kind of decline rates that we be looking at for the PDPs at both Viper and Diamondback like for the next year or two? Travis Stice : Yes. I think Adam somewhere in that mid-30s range on PDP decline. Again, we haven't gone through our reserve audit yet at the end of the year. But, I think that's kind of mid \u2013 somewhere in the mid-30s for a decline rate. Adam Michael : Okay. That's helpful. And I saw your lending indicative proved a higher borrowing basin you guys elected to keep it kind of come down a little bit. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little insight as to what the lenders out there are running through their models as far as price deck and what kind of oil price they are assuming. Travis Stice : Well, I think your -- the question be best directed to the banking community that runs those. But, I can tell you in a general sense that they have always run more conservative pricing based on lending. But, I will also tell you that each lender has like they call it different things but distressed price test but they also test your borrowing base against and I don't know Russell, is it kind of the distressed test do you have any specifics on it just a low price I don't know what it is because probably each bank as a different number. But, I do know that they are each going through there and testing a really low price as well as they make their lending decisions. Adam Michael : Okay. And just one final follow-up question it look like the Viper was kind of dipping its toe in the water in the Delaware basin based on the filings for the recent capital raise acquired some assets. Looks like a small position, I was wondering can you elaborate a little bit about the Delaware basin what you are seeing there that might be attractive to on the Viper side. Travis Stice : Well, I think the Delaware basin acquisition that we highlighted on the Viper \u2013 on the most recent Viper releases points to our consistent strategy of looking at basins that are all weighted that are under active development in targeting portions of that development with confident operators in that Delaware basin acquisition that we talked about certainly fits in there. And I think continues to give us encouragement that there is opportunities out in the Delaware basin for additional work for Viper. Adam Michael : Okay. Great quarter guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Connolly of Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Connolly : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I would like to take another stab at the deceleration one, if we assume that kind of the current service cost environment remains, is there a level for WTI where you look to get a little more aggressive and start to accelerate again? Travis Stice : Yes. Again, Jeff, I'm trying not to get specific numbers out there I know that makes it difficult. I mean I know that that makes your business difficult. But, let me just step back for a lot of these modeling questions that you guys are asking me. Look we are -- Diamondback is extremely well positioned both for difficult times, if more difficult more times are coming or for more opportunistic times if things improve. We are in a spectacular position both from a strength of our balance sheet. But, also if you look at where record revenues, record production, record EBITDA, our execution appears to be among the best \u2013 continues to be among the best in the basin. Ur expense structure is extremely low. So that to me indicates a company that's extremely well-positioned to handle things that are going to be difficult or maybe things that are going to improve in the future. So again, I know you guy are trying to model specifically but that's kind of the story, we're sticking too. Jeffrey Connolly : That's good. I appreciate that. I know it's a little early too and we'll get some more in December. And then hop in kind of Dawson County, can you give us some color there and any change in your thoughts on that acreage in terms of what zones you might want to target next? Travis Stice : Yes. The Dawson County I drilled a four Cline well, it's the simplest way to say that and I won't drill another Cline well based on those results. Now I also drilled about 8 miles to the south of it I drilled a Lower Spraberry well in Northern Martin County that looks extremely good. And so to that end, we believe and there is also some and we think there's some more industry data out there in the Lower Spraberry that while the thermal maturity may not be as high as is what's needed for peak oil generation, it appears that the permeability in the system and the processing of system are allowing for some economic Spraberry wells. So to that end, we're testing a Lower Spraberry well on that acreage right now. Jeffrey Connolly : Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate the color. Travis Stice : You bet, Jeff. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open. Jamaal Dardar : Good morning guys. Just had a few questions with the rig count being flat year-over-year, would that imply sort of a flat year-over-year CapEx, not sure if the shallower Lower Spraberry wells were materially cheaper than Wolfcamp B or not? Travis Stice : Yes. Jamaal, first off, I've not said that we're going to be flat on a rig count year-over-year. All I clearly stated was that we'll enter the year at five horizontal rigs and we'll make adjustments based on market conditions early on in 2015. Specifically to your question on Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B cost, there is \u2013 notionally a little cheaper in the Lower Spraberry because they have to (indiscernible) purposes and for your planning purposes, I'd use the same costs on the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp B. Jamaal Dardar : Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. And just given your balance sheet strength and low cost operations, at what point would you get to think that you would rather invest in M&A rather than drilling an incremental well? Travis Stice : Yes. Jamaal, I think what I said is that we're going to be opportunistic. I think we're well-positioned with the strength of our balance sheet and low cost operations and we're well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that come in the M&A world and I think they will, I remain optimistic that Diamondback is going to be in the best position to try to transact on these opportunities that come our way. So again, I can't give you specifically when I quit drilling and go to acquisitions because it depends on some many different market conditions that aren't clear right now. So again, we'll talk more about 2015 in 2015. Jamaal Dardar : Okay. That's all I got. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Jamaal. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Oatman of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Please check to make sure your line is not mute. Travis Stice : I'm sorry Candice. I just want to respond back to the prior question. If you go back and look at our history of acquisitions, which we've been highly acquisitive in the last two years, we've always done accretive deals. So again as we look at opportunities we've always done accretive deals, always have and we'll probably always will be going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler of Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Hey, good morning Travis. I jumped on a little bit late so I hope I not rehash anything but just curious about those five rigs the kind of the contract structures you have and also maybe on the completion side just what you're looking at as far as optionality as you get into 2015 and then where you can go up or down? Travis Stice : Sure. We've got two rigs that are rolling off their existing contracts in early February so that will be the first kind of get checked, we're going to have to make is what decisions we'll make on those rigs, do we let them go or do we continue on a well to well, month to month or six months contract. So again, we'll make that decision with better clarity around market conditions. On the pressure pumping side, we've got really good relationship with our business partners on that side, but we don't have a specific contract on any of those guys. So, we're in communications right now to make sure that certain recalibration existing in concert with the decline in commodity price. Jason Wangler : That's great. I'll turn it back. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Reagor of ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is now open. Joseph Reagor : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Most of the stuff I was interested already touched on, but you guys talked about cash flow 2015 back half being positive. Can you give us a little insight to what numbers you ran that analysis on like what oil price you use and what assumption as far as rig count at that time? Travis Stice : Yes. Joe, again, we're not providing that level of color because there is still a lot of unknowns, it depends on ultimately what happens from a commodity price and ultimately where service cost gets recalibrated. We do have an internal model that generates that cash flow positive in the second half of the year. But again that's not something that I've communicated fully to my Board yet and it's something that we think and occur under set of oil price, commodity price, service cost and activity levels for next year. And again, a big hinge point on that would be how successful these Lower Spraberry wells are going to be in 2015 because outperformance like we're seeing right now has a material impact on our cash flow position next year. Joseph Reagor : Okay. Maybe asked a different way, if everything held constant to today, when do you think it reach cash flow positive, so five rigs today's oil and gas prices, today's cost? Travis Stice : I'm trying to think Joe on how the best way to answer that question. We're just not provided that level of clarity and I know Joe you got to put it in your spreadsheet, but I'm just not going to get back in the corner on exactly what things look like in 2015. Joseph Reagor : Okay. I'll move on to one other thing. With the two rigs do up in Spraberry, that's of the existing five rigs that you plan entering the year. Are there any rigs that you've contracted that you are not yet in possession of that could be used as like replacement so instead of renewing those two you have another two there you've already placed that up to come in or anything like that? Travis Stice : Yes. We've got three rigs, three new builds that are coming into our fleet throughout 2015, and early 2016. Joseph Reagor : Okay. Travis Stice : And we also believe that if market conditions materially degrade or perhaps persist at their current levels that you're going to see the availability of the one more horizontal rig. So we think we preserved optionality on both sides the accelerated inventory as well as decelerating that inventory next year. Joseph Reagor : Okay. Thanks for the color guys. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Travis Stice, CEO for any closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Candice. I know that the guys on the phone based on the late release of several of your notes last night, several of you guys have been up all night. So I know this is a busy time of the year for you, but I appreciate your specific questions into Diamondback and continued coverage. And I also want to thank everyone that participated in today's call. Certainly, if you have any questions, reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Adam Lawlis of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint fourth quarter and year end 2014 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. We also posted an investor presentation for Viper on its website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Tracy Dick, CFO as well as other members of our exec team. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you all for listening to Diamondback\u2019s and Viper Energy Partners fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Last month, in our operations update, we announced fourth quarter production, 2015 guidance and encouraging Lower Spraberry results. Last night, we announced additional encouraging Lower Spraberry results, including our first 500-foot interlateral downspacing test, which is performing in line with the nearby three-well pad on 660-foot spacing. We believe our second Lower Spraberry test in Andrews County and our first test in Dawson County confirmed the strength of the Spraberry formation across the majority of our acreage. As a result of continued strong Lower Spraberry well results, Ryder Scott has increased our PUD reserve levels for a 7,500-foot lateral in Midland County to 990,000 BOE equivalent on a two-stream basis from 650,000 BOE previously. Considering that we built Diamondback Energy on the back of the Wolfcamp B shale, it\u2019s really exciting to embark on yet another development horizon, which appears to be materially better than the Wolfcamp B. We also reported reserves in which we showed proved reserves increasing year-over-year by 77%, up to 113 million barrels of oil equivalent at an associated drill bit finding and development cost of $11.09 per barrel. Proved developed reserves increased 122% over last year to 66.5 million barrels. Additionally, last month, we strengthened our already strong balance sheet by issuing equity. Pro forma for the proceeds from the equity raise, our net debt to annualized 4Q \u201814 EBITDA now sits at 1.2 times. Now, turning to the company presentation Adam referred to. In Slide 4, we depict how at $50 per barrel WTI Lower Spraberry rates of return in Spanish Trail range from approximately 50% to 125% based on the new Ryder Scott estimate of nearly 1 million barrels of oil equivalent for 7,500-foot lateral. Our Spanish Trail Lower Spraberry wells have a breakeven price below $30 a barrel. 65% to 75% of our drilling activity in Spanish Trail this year will target the Lower Spraberry. On Slide 5, we have provided more detailed information on our type curve expectations across our acreage base. Note that several wells, although early on in their production, are outperforming the Ryder Scott type curve. On Slide 7, we show our historical reserve growth. Since 2012, reserves have increased 181%. F&D costs have decreased to $11.09 per barrel during 2014 from $14.46 per barrel in 2013. This is a reduction in F&D of almost 25% reflecting the early promising results, the Lower Spraberry booked at higher EUR per well than last year. As depicted in Slide 9 Diamondback continues to have higher cash margins and lower operating expense metrics than our Permian peers. We are a lean organization and expect to continue optimizing our costs. Our full year \u201814 LOE per barrel was $7.79 which was above guidance of $6 to $7 per barrel. This was due to the nearly 300 vertical wells acquired during 2014 on leases which had substantially higher operating costs. If you strip out the acquired properties, full year 2014 LOE would have been $6.87 per barrel within the guided range. This past quarter was the first to have the full impact from the properties that closed in September. We are working hard to apply our low cost efficient practices on these properties and expect to average between $6.50 and $7.50 per barrel in 2015. Slide 10 shows how our vertical wells and LOE per barrel have changed since the fourth quarter of 2012. In 2013 we decreased LOE from $11.39 to $6.04 in the fourth quarter as we increased the amount of horizontal wells drilled and drove costs lower. We are confident we can replicate this success and expect to see cost savings from reductions in well failure rates and other LOE spend categories. As mentioned in our interim operations update, our focus this year is on capital discipline, stockholder returns and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As previously reported, we are in the process of dropping two horizontal rigs this month and have already released our remaining vertical rig. In 2015 we expect to run three horizontal rigs, including two in Spanish Trail where Viper owns the underlying minerals. Slide 12 shows how the Permian rig count and WTI prices have changed since 2001. Since the beginning of 2015 Permian operators have dropped approximately 140 rigs. Cost concessions are responding to the lower commodity environment. And we are currently seeing approximately 10% to 15% overall reductions. Frac spreads have been slow to respond due to the backlog of completions, but we are beginning to see them react as well. Of our nearly 1,650 net potential horizontal locations of inventory shown in Slide 16, less than 4% are currently booked as PUDs. Assuming the midpoint of the EUR ranges, we have over 800 million barrels of resource potential remaining based on that locations in our inventory. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Tracy Dick : Thank you, Travis. Diamondback\u2019s net income for the quarter was $98.7 million or $1.74 per diluted share. After adjusting our fourth quarter earnings for non-cash mark to market derivative gains of $111.5 million and netting out the related income tax effect, our adjusted net income was $27.3 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Diamondback\u2019s adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $111.7 million. Our average realized price for the fourth quarter was $55.60 per BOE and due to the positive impact and our hedge position, our average realized price including the effect of hedges was $62.63 per BOE. We laid out the details of our current hedge position in last night\u2019s earnings release and on Slide 19 of the presentation. In 2015 we have nearly 11,000 barrel a day of oil hedged with swaps at an average price of approximately $88 per barrel. Turning to costs, our LOE was $7.79 per BOE for the full year. As Travis mentioned fourth quarter was the first quarter with the full effect of both acquisitions. Excluding the effect of the acquisitions LOE for the year would have been $6.87 per BOE within our guidance range. Our general and administrative costs came in at $2.65 per BOE for the fourth quarter. This includes non-cash equity based compensation, excluding equity comp G&A is $1.02 per BOE. In the fourth quarter of 2014 Diamondback generated $104.4 million of operating cash flow and $106.8 million of discretionary cash flow or $1.83 and $1.87 per diluted share respectively. During 2014 we spent approximately $487 million for drilling, completion and infrastructure. Our capital spent drove production which exceeded the high end of our production guidance. As of January 30, 2015, we had $128 million drawn on our secured revolving credit facility, after paying down part of the balance with proceeds from our recent equity raise. Last year, our lenders approved a borrowing base increase of 114% to $750 million, but we elected to limit the commitment to $500 million, which we believe provides plenty of liquidity. We estimate our 2015 year end debt to EBITDA will be less than two times. At current commodity prices and with the current drilling programs, we expect that we will turn cash flow positive in the second half of this year. On Slide 20, we detail out our guidance for 2015. As previously announced we expect 2015 productions to range between 26,000 BOE and 28,000 BOE per day. This includes a range of 4,200 BOE to 2,500 BOE per day attributable to Viper. Turning to operating costs, our 2015 LOE is guided to the range of $6.50 to $7.50 per BOE. Our cash G&A projection is $1 to $2 per BOE and our non-cash equity compensation is also expected to be in the range of $1 to $2 per BOE. We have forecasted our DD&A rate between $20 to $22 per BOE and production and ad valorem taxes are guided at 7.1% of revenue. In 2015, we expect our capital spending to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. I will now turn briefly to Viper Energy Partners, which recently announced a cash distribution of $0.25 per unit for the fourth quarter. During the quarter cash available for distribution was $20 million and production increased 24% quarter-over-quarter to 4,200 BOE per day. Viper has no debt and an undrawn revolver of $110 million as of December 31, 2014. Turning to Viper\u2019s guidance, we expect 2015 volumes in the range of 4,200 BOE to 4,500 BOE per day. Production and ad valorem taxes approximately 7.5% of revenue. Our cash G&A projection is $1 to $2 per BOE, and our non-cash unit based compensation is expected to be in the range of $2 to $3 per BOE. DD&A is expected to be $20 to $22 per BOE. And as a reminder, Viper does not incur at least operating expenses or capital expenditures. I will now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Tracy. To summarize our track record of capital discipline, stockholder returns and maintaining our strong balance sheet has prepared us for this downturn. The Lower Spraberry shale is delivering exceptional results. And we have increased our reserves substantially over last year at a very lower F&D costs. Our focus on costs, expenses and execution has never wavered and we continue to deliver cash margins per barrel and lower expenses at the top of our peer group. With our low cost structure and our ownership of minerals through Viper, we believe that we will generate significantly higher returns than most. We remain committed to growing the company through accretive transactions. I believe that it is in these challenging times that great companies are made and Diamondback Energy remains a low-cost producer in the highest return basin. Before I open the call for questions, I want to pause and acknowledge our employees for all they accomplished last year and have already accomplished this year. Even though we are in tough times with respect to commodity prices, I firmly believe our best is yet to come. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Amoss of Iberia Capital Partners. Sir, you may begin. David Amoss : Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning, David. David Amoss : Travis, I just wanted to see if I could get an update on what the pressure pumping backlog looks like in the basin right now, I know you talked about it a month ago, have you seen any improvement or where does that sit kind of on a relative basis versus where you are a month ago? Travis Stice : I think our friends on the pressure pumping side are probably the best to answer that. I can tell you from the operators\u2019 perspective though there is a still quite a bit of backlog of completions that are really reflective of the really actively levels in the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year. That being said though while 2014 \u2013 at the end of 2014, we weren\u2019t seeing much cost movement on the pressure pumping side. And really even honestly into the month of January, they were still a little bit slow to respond. I will tell you starting almost February 1 we have seen some \u2013 we started to see some cost concessions and we anticipate improvements in cost not only from pressure pumping guys, but really the rest of the service sector probably through the next couple of quarters. David Amoss : Okay. And then as a reaction, when could or would you start to defer completions, if you are not getting the traction? Travis Stice : Yes, David, that\u2019s a real good question. And quite honestly, as we were exiting \u201814 and not getting the cost concessions that I thought were reflective of $45 oil, we started deferring some completions. We had a dedicated frac crew, we let go and we are furloughing about a third of the days currently in a month right now deferring some completions. And we will continue to kind of build a small backlog of maybe a dozen or so or less wells until we can get the cost concessions that I believe are reflective of $50 oil. And at that time, we will potentially pick activity back up on the completion side. But that also is a pretty common phenomenon I am hearing around the basin as well, which I think probably why we started seeing some movement in costs effective February 1. David Amoss : Alright. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Congratulations guys on a great quarter. Travis Stice : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Kistler of Simmons & Company. You may begin. David Kistler : Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning, Dave. David Kistler : Looking at the downspacing results in the Lower Spraberry that were impressive and certainly add to your inventory, can we assume that you would expect to see similar results in the Wolfcamp B, given similar rock qualities or maybe even slightly lesser rock quality than the Lower Spraberry? Travis Stice : Dave, that\u2019s certainly something we are looking at pretty hard here internally. I can tell you right now, our current thinking \u2013 current thinking is probably that, that would be too tight for the Wolfcamp B, although I think the industry and Diamondback probably need to test some increased lateral, interlateral spacing or tighter spacing before we make that definitive statement, but right now our best thinking is probably that 10 across a section is probably not the right answer in the Wolfcamp B. David Kistler : Okay, I appreciate that. And then maybe as a follow-up to that in the current commodity price environment, how do you guys think about doing delineation drilling, downspacing drilling or maybe even more specifically additional science work over the next, call it, 12 months or so maybe until either costs recalibrate appropriately or commodity prices look to improve? Travis Stice : Yes, certainly on the first point there, delineation drilling, we have outlined a three-rig program for this year and two of those rigs are being in Spanish Trail. So, that\u2019s not \u2013 there is no delineation going there. That third rig, Dave, would be bouncing around between Northeast Andrews, Martin County, and a few drilling obligations we have. So, that \u2013 you kind of think of that third rig as a delineation rig. And then specifically to science, I have always been a little reluctant in a basin that\u2019s got over 400,000 wells drilled to spend a lot of money on science instead preferring to spend our science dollars at the drill bit phase. That being said though, I think there is some \u2013 there is some really exciting technologies on the micro-seismic that can help us validate tighter spacing in our development scenarios and certainly now is the time to consider doing that versus running a multi \u2013 8-rig program in our asset base that we would like to have answered this year. So, that\u2019s probably the only science we are going to do is maybe a little bit of micro-science testing here in the next quarter and then we will see what happens after that. David Kistler : Great. I appreciate that. And one last one just with Tracy\u2019s comments about being free cash flow neutral in the second half of the year and looking at sort of the production guidance you guys have given us, in the event that you guys accelerated, how quickly do you think you could start bringing production growth back in a meaningful fashion on a quarter-over-quarter basis? Travis Stice : Yes, they are certainly \u2013 Dave, they are certainly measured in quarters. So, if we were to pick back up and start a full frac spread of completions starting in July, you probably wouldn\u2019t see that, that effect until mid fourth quarter by the time you start getting everything online and producing. So, to the extent, we continue to defer completions, we will probably be at the lower end of our production guidance to the extent that we kind of pick up mid-year if there is a recalibration appropriately on service cost that probably pushes more towards the upper end of our range. But there is still a lot that has to play out on commodity price and service costs before we are going to increase activity. David Kistler : Great, really appreciate the added color there Travis and also your commitment to capital discipline you kind of set a standard for others, appreciate that. Travis Stice : Thank you, Dave. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering Holt & Company. Your line is now open. Michael Rowe : Hi good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning Michael. Michael Rowe : Wanted to see maybe if you could provide or if you have enough information really at this point to quantify the impact of weather-related disruptions for Q1 that you all talked about in January? Travis Stice : Yes, we have probably got roughly for the quarter maybe 1,000 barrels a day or so of impact. It was really a 2 week event early on in January. And really by the 10th day we were pretty much on track to get everything back on and I think it should be noise in the first quarter, but we will wait and see how the quarter ends up. Michael Rowe : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the cost reduction initiatives that you are working with on the LOE side, you kind of talked about on one of your slides I think it was \u2013 I can\u2019t find the slide number off top of my head, but talk about some things you are trying to do to bring down LOE. And so I just wanted to see if you could maybe quantify what are the bigger drivers there of costs and I guess specifically you all can do from a competitive advantage standpoint versus your peers aside from just having the mineral barrels flowing through your financial statements? Travis Stice : Well, specifically Michael the well failure rate on these acquired properties was running around one, which means each one of these wells were failing once a year, that\u2019s unacceptable for Diamondback standards. We need a well failure rate at 0.5 or below which means these wells should fail once every 2 years. And we had a lot of well maintenance related events due to poor pumping practices on these acquired properties that required us quite honestly to go in and look at everything from the pump placement, the metallurgy of the rods and the tubing that were in the ground as well as what we call telemetry which is a real-time monitoring of how that pumping unit performs most of these wells that didn\u2019t have telemetry installed on so we could monitor performance. So we have gradually been upgrading these vertical wells at the same time instituting new field wide well failure reports, so that we can understand why these wells are failing and how to remediate it. And I guess rather than spend more time explaining that I mean, if you go back in our history, you can see that the reason I put that slide in there. This is the same dance that we were involved in trying to get the historical or the legacy vertical wells at Diamondback Energy pumping in the best in class fashion. So I have got a pretty good track record and I have got a very capable organization that\u2019s well skilled in making these adjustments happen. So those are things we can absolutely control. And then the other one is that quite honestly we are seeing on the LOE side those people that support the expenses have been pretty quick to respond in reducing cost as well. So it\u2019s a combination of really three things. It\u2019s a combination of proactive pumping practices that we employee, it\u2019s an inter-combination of increasing volumes and a combination of lowering service cost in these major LOE spend areas. Michael Rowe : Okay. That\u2019s great, and maybe just one last one if I could squeeze it in here would just be got some really phenomenal rates of return in the Lower Spraberry particularly when you factor in the mineral uplift and so just want to see if there is at any point where you would consider hedging maybe a little bit of volumes in 2016 to protect strong economics there and potentially maintain operational momentum heading into next year should commodity prices stay where they are or even kind of fall back a little bit? Thank you. Travis Stice : Yes, you bet Michael. And yes we have certainly considered hedging 2016 production. Curve\u2019s is in contango right now and we just need to \u2013 we were studying it real closely. So, that\u2019s a fair question and probably realistic expectations if we didn\u2019t get the right prices in 2016, you will look to \u2013 we should look to mirror kind of what we have done in 2014, which is around 40% to 70% of our current production hedged. Michael Rowe : Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Rezvan of Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Tim Rezvan : Hi, good morning folks. I had a quick question on Spraberry inventory. On Slide 16, you give that 348 net location, I know we spoke yesterday, you mentioned 225 in Midland County on 660-foot spacing. So, are you seeing you \u2013 I just want to clarify that roughly two-thirds of this inventory you list here is in that Midland County area? Travis Stice : Yes, that 225 number is not just Midland County, that\u2019s Midland, Southwest Martin, Northwest Martin and kind of the southern half of our Northeast Andrews County acreage, where we have drilled that Tawny well and Mason well with real good results. So, that if you look at it for that area, if you assume 660-foot spacing, then we have got 220 Lower Spraberry locations remaining. If we can do it on 500-foot spacing or 10 laterals per section, then we are up at 277 locations remaining. And those counts are net wells at 7,500-foot equivalent lateral lengths. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Travis Stice : Yes. So, the 220 number is not just Midland County, it\u2019s kind of at Midland, Martin, Andrews area that we think we have proved up with our results. Tim Rezvan : Okay. So, that delta, that 120 is really a kind of where you have less well control? Travis Stice : Yes. Tim Rezvan : Okay, I appreciate that update. And then lastly I know I am probably not going to get a good answer here, but you talked about being on the lookout for accretive acquisitions. I was wondering if you could give any kind of color on what the state of the M&A market is just from I am sure that you see all deal flow on your desk. And if you could define \u2013 explain what you defined as an accretive acquisition, whether that\u2019s just kind of on NAV basis or what the metrics you are looking for? Thanks. Travis Stice : You debt. Thanks, Tim. Yes, certainly, there is \u2013 we are seeing a lot of the M&A activity out here in the Permian Basin. I don\u2019t know if the full effect of low commodity prices and distressed assets has been felt yet, probably more of a mid-year or late 2Q event. But one thing, I do note, Tim, is that \u2013 is the position that Diamondback has placed themselves in, not only with our execution prowess, but also our pristine balance sheet in the M&A activity that, that is ongoing in the Permian. I think my shareholders should expect Diamondback to be right in the middle of that, if not the first call that\u2019s being made. So, I know you said you probably weren\u2019t going to get a good answer and that\u2019s probably not a good answer, but that\u2019s kind of how we think about it. Accretive EBITDA per share is usually a good one that we kind of look at, but then there is multiple accretion metrics as well, reserves production, acreage etcetera as well. Tim Rezvan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Michael of Miller Tabak. Your line is now open. Adam Michael : Good morning, guys. My question is centered around the PUD reserves that were booked. And I noticed in the presentation that you have 64 locations booked as PUDs and I think your guidance was for 50 to 60 wells this year and that\u2019s with reduced rig count. It just seems a little conservative and I wanted to maybe just see if we could get a little more color on kind of the thought behind the PUD bookings and it certainly seems like you could have booked twice as many PUDs with the drilling inventory that you had in the 5-year rule, even with the reduced rig count. So, maybe just a little more color there please? Travis Stice : Yes, that 64 locations, that\u2019s a net number. It\u2019s 79 gross horizontal wells that we have booked as PUDs and 53 of those are in the Wolfcamp B, 20 are in the Lower Spraberry. So, we had a lot of several of our Lower Spraberry wells that we talk about came on either real late in 2014 or actually early 2015. And so we didn\u2019t have any PUDs booked to offset to those wells. And we have generally been conservative along Ryder Scott on our PUD booking. We generally only book PUDs one location away. So if you look at it right now we have got 15 Lower Spraberry wells on production and nearly 20 Lower Spraberry PUDs. So I mean it is a fairly conservative number, but we have generally been conservative in the way we have looked our PUDs over time. So it\u2019s as you mentioned it\u2019s quite not early a reflection of our inventory. And we have obviously got a lot of good inventory in the Lower Spraberry and also remaining in the Wolfcamp B as well. Adam Michael : It\u2019s refreshing to see especially in light of some of your peers and how they have approached PUDs, but that\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks Adam. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Jason Wangler of Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Just curious, Travis as you look and then obviously the three rigs you are going to be running hereafter February, as things improve, or obviously given the returns you are making, if you would look to add another rig at some point, is there a thought to continuing Spanish Springs, is there a thought to go to other areas or maybe even the other formation which is continue on with Lower Spraberry which maybe either move back to the move to the B or perhaps even to something else, just kind of curious the thoughts there? Travis Stice : Yes. Certainly Jason for us to increase activity is going to require continued service cost and some stability in the oil price probably in the $65 to $75 range. And if we were to pick another rig up, we would likely move that into our recently acquired acreage over in Glasscock County and Midland County where we know we have got some really, really nice results both in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp B. So that\u2019s probably where that rig would go and we would just leave the two rigs in Spanish Trials working and one rig there are in some delineation work accordingly. Jason Wangler : That\u2019s helpful. And then you kind of mentioned about the LOE and the things you can do as far as driving the cost down at obviously guide that you put out for 2015, just as far cadence looking at that throughout the year is that going to be pretty gradual reduction as you kind of work through that for lack of better word backlog of wells that you have been worked on, that you acquired or just how you see that playing out? Travis Stice : Yes, exactly I wish like it\u2019s not my fingers and make it happen over night but there is just a lot of hard work that has to go in to fixing these legacy issues, so I expect sort of a quarter-over-quarter decline that\u2019s going to get us in that $6.50 to $7.50 range, by the end of the year. Jason Wangler : Great, I will turn it back. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Kelly : Hey guys, good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning Mike. Mike Kelly : Travis, your F&D costs and they certainly speak to thanks for your capital efficiency relative to the industry and your other permanent peers. And my question is I am just curious of how or where you see the probably the biggest opportunities going forward to continue to push your operational efficiencies that really if you continue this downward trend of the de-cost effects? Travis Stice : Yes, and certainly I will look on two of the major spend areas on drilling these wells, which is the drilling side and then the completion side. Right now it\u2019s about \u2013 of the total it\u2019s about 40% allocated to the drilling side and about 60% on the completion side. On the completion side of that 60%, about half of that is related to pressure pumping. And so as we continue to see reductions in pressure pumping cost that\u2019s going to translate to lower cost as well too. And then on the drilling side, we continued to optimize our efficiency both in terms of how fast we get to PD and then also with the other ancillary costs that are associated with drilling these wells. And so it\u2019s really not a single actually one or two item that I could point to that\u2019s going to push our cost lower. It\u2019s really all those steps the completion guys do on their side of the equation delivering completed well cost, invest in class fashion as well as the drilling guys drilling these wells faster and faster so it\u2019s kind of an efficiency thing. So, it\u2019s really the combination of a 1,000 decisions we make on a daily basis not just one or two decisions on a quarter basis. Mike Kelly : Understood. And then if we look at recoveries and 2015\u2019s program is going to be core to drill and arguably your best of Spanish Trail\u2019s. What\u2019s kind of a ballpark way we should think about the average well EUR uptick in \u201815 versus \u201814\u2019s program? Travis Stice : I would say, probably you are looking at maybe 10% or 15% uptick. I think we have said probably two-thirds of our wells will target the Lower Spraberry roughly 25% in the Wolfcamp B and then we will probably have a couple of tests in some other zones, including the Middle Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A as we do some stack tests. So, a little bit more weighted more to the Spraberry this year than last year and as long as we continue to see the results we have seen so far in the Lower Spraberry, I think that 10% to 15% uptick is probably a pretty reasonable number. Mike Kelly : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann of Howard Weil. Your line is now open. Jeb Bachmann : Good morning, everyone. Travis, just a quick question, looking at the vertical PUDs booked, I saw you took down by 6.2 million barrels at year end \u201814. Just wondering if the ones you still have on the books, are those of younger vintage? Is that why they are still there or there is any other reason? Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, they are younger vintage and they are also in the areas where we have seen better EURs from our vertical wells. So, some of the ones that part of that 73 were ones that we weren\u2019t going to get drilled within the 5 years, but we also took some off that were kind of in our lower EUR areas that would probably have to come off at the end of \u2013 into 2015 assuming that commodity prices stay low. Jeb Bachmann : And I guess \u2013 I am sorry, go ahead. Travis Stice : No, go ahead. Jeb Bachmann : Just to follow on that, with the location count on the vertical side, I guess at what point do you guys start taking down some of those, if we are in a 1-year or 2-year kind of prolonged, maybe even longer commodity price weakness? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean, we will just have to see how the commodity price plays out. Some of those locations are in \u2013 or probably about half of those locations are in Spanish Trail, where we own the minerals. So, it has considerably better economics than a typical vertical well. So, obviously, our horizontal wells are delivering better returns and that\u2019s where the focus will remain, but we will just see how that plays out by the end of the year. Jeb Bachmann : Alright, thanks for the answers guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Jeb. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Richard Tullis : Hey, good morning everyone. Couple of quick questions related to M&A continuing with that theme, Travis. As you look at the landscape right now given everything the commodity prices, your efficiencies, are you willing to look outside the Midland Basin if you see appropriate attractive opportunity, say it were in the Delaware basin or even outside the Permian at this point, Travis? Travis Stice : Yes, Richard, what I would tell my guys, there is really no bad deals, there is just bad pricing. And so from the Viper perspective, we have been looking outside the Permian for Viper and not so much Diamondback, but the logical progression for Diamondback would probably be in the Delaware Basin, but it\u2019s pretty exciting in one regards and it\u2019s also pretty confusing in terms of what really is going to transpire in this M&A environment, because of all the new private equity money that\u2019s been raised, that\u2019s looking for a home in the Permian Basin. Some folks are thinking this maybe the best chance to get into the Permian. So, again like I was talking to Tim earlier, I don\u2019t know exactly how it\u2019s all going to play out, but I do know with the fortress balance sheet and our execution record that we ought to be in all those conversations. Richard Tullis : Okay. And then just going back to Viper, Travis, how are things progressing, looking to add mineral interests there, is the bid/ask spread still fairly wide or are you seeing attractive opportunities? Travis Stice : Yes, I would say that the bid/ask rate is still pretty wide for cash types of transactions, because the commodity price is down 55% or 60% since we IPO\u2019d the Viper Energy Partners, but one thing that we are always trying to get a little bit of traction with is the acknowledgment that receiving Viper units from minerals is starting to have some appeal at these prices. So, we are engaged and we are looking hard and we will report when we close something. Richard Tullis : Alright. Well, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks very much. Travis Stice : Thanks, Richard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Hall : Thanks. Congrats on the good update. A lot of mine have, I guess, been addressed, but just kind of follow-up on some of the existing questions, just to make sure I am understanding it right, as it relates to the weighting on completion backlog, you said you kind of build up around a dozen wells waiting on completion. Does the current guidance assume those are drawn down or is it maybe fair to say that the low end assumes that those remain in backlog as you make your way through the full course of the year and the higher end of guidance then \u2013 seems those get put on in the second half? Travis Stice : Yes, Michael. I think I was \u2013 I think I tried \u2013 maybe I didn\u2019t do it efficiently, but I will try to address that earlier. To the extent, we maintain a backlog of completions through the middle of the year we will probably be more towards the lower end of our production guidance range. To the extent that we reinitiate the pressure pumping side of the equation and get another crew in, we will probably push it more towards the higher end. And the other thing is, is that we continue to be surprised as we outlined a numerous points in our prepared remarks this morning by this Lower Spraberry. And what we tried to account for that in our production guidance, these wells are certainly surprising us to the upside and that doesn\u2019t usually happen in our business. So, to the extent, we bring more and more Lower Spraberry wells on and surprise us positively, that will also help push us towards the upper end of our production guidance. Michael Hall : Great. And I guess as we think about that Lower Spraberry, one other question I had was just around on the downspacing side, is the Spraberry consistent enough throughout all the various portions of the portfolio that that downspacing assumption is fair to take across the board, do you think or would you\u2026. Travis Stice : I think it\u2019s a little early right now, Michael, to say all the way across our portfolio, because if you look, I think I got a slide in the slide deck that shows we have now got economic test from Dawson County all the way down to Upton County. That\u2019s about 120 miles. And so I think it would be a little bold at this point to step out and say everywhere you can downspace, but I will tell you if you just look at unconventional resource plays around the United States, typically over time they get spaced tighter and tighter. Whatever they start off with is usually not where they end up with. And of course, you got to balance that with the risk of overcapitalization. So, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s prudent for Diamondback to continue to test this downspacing in a way that allows us as much optionality in the future to continue developing in a full-scale fashion at the right spacing intervals. Michael Hall : That\u2019s helpful. And what was it about the Wolfcamp B that you said that maybe you all weren\u2019t quite as optimistic about the opportunity to downspace there to 500-foot interlateral spacing? What is it about that reservoir that is kind of pointing you in that direction, I am just curious? Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, of course this varies across different peoples, I agree, but when you look at our acreage, we think there is a reasonable frac barrier between the Wolfcamp A and B. And so you are probably generating more fracture half-length and less height than the B. If you look at the Lower Spraberry, which overall is quite a bit thicker than the B, but you really don\u2019t have any barriers to height growth. Michael Hall : Okay. Travis Stice : So, you are generating as much height as half-length and that\u2019s the reason. Really two reasons we think we can go to tighter spacing on the Spraberry and that is we are probably not generating is much effective length and you have got a lot more oil in place in this Spraberry, as well. Michael Hall : That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks. And then last of mine, I guess on the somewhat recently acquired acreage in Glasscock and Western Midland, is there any leasehold expiration considerations that need to be taken into account even if I keep in mind, that if prices remain low for long, that might force some activity over there? Travis Stice : Yes. Michael we have got a good handle on that. And the guidance we have given for this year incorporates maintaining leases not only in the Glasscock County, but across our acreage position. Michael Hall : Fair enough. Thanks. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of KLR Group. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning everyone. I am looking at the Dawson County that Lower Spraberry test was a really solid well, has there been any difference in that well behavior versus your Midland area Lower Spraberry wells? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean it\u2019s a nice result, it\u2019s obviously not as good as what we have seen in Midland County or even Northwest Martin, Northeast Andrews you can see that from the 30 day rates, but still a nice well. It has decent economics at $50 oil, it\u2019s probably in that 15%, 20% rate of returns of really we probably need higher oil prices in the $65 to $70 a barrel before we go there and drill much offset wells there. But still nice results overall. Gail Nicholson : And then in that Lower Spraberry location count that you guys provided in the horizontal count how many are allocated to Dawson? Travis Stice : I think right now we have got I think there are 24 wells that we have in Dawson and obviously if it works I mean there is more potential locations in that but we risk that number down for Dawson until we get some more results. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then looking on Page 13 in the presentation and looking at the Lower Spraberry on well results that you have there, have there been any different method of completion techniques within those Midland County Lower Spraberrys or you have been completing them the same way I mean those lateral lengths have varied, but I wasn\u2019t sure if you are putting more propane or doing spacing with the frac stages anything different on those? Travis Stice : It\u2019s been pretty much the same recipe we have done some testing with 30-50 a little bit larger sand in this Spraberry, but in the general sense we have maintained that 240 kind of foot inter-stage spacing and 300,000 or so pounds of total sands per stage that\u2019s kind of being our go to. And you have heard us talk a little bit about shortening that inter-stage distance maybe down to 150-feet or so. And we are continuing to experiment with that and still way too early on to talk about whether or not we have got positive results. But we continue to try to tweak on these stimulation designs, because never satisfied that we have got the right answer, in fact our history says that these things evolve over time, so we want to make sure we are pushing that evolution. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Thank you. Travis Stice : Great Gail. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Abhi Sinha of Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Abhi Sinha : Yes. Hi, good morning everybody. Just want a quick update on Viper\u2019s inventory, so has your estimate of like 127 wells that\u2019s what I thought for Lower Spraberry changed and what about the total number of horizontal drilling locations that was like 1,060 last time when we got an update? Travis Stice : Yes. I am not sure I have caught all of that, are you talking about the number of locations in Viper\u2019s inventory? Abhi Sinha : Yes, sir. So it was 127 wells in the Lower Spraberry for Viper\u2019s inventory? Travis Stice : Yes. That\u2019s still based on the 660-foot spacing. We haven\u2019t increased that number yet for further down spacing. Abhi Sinha : Sure. And I believe the total horizontal drilling locations also remain the same like 1060 where it was before? Travis Stice : That\u2019s correct. Abhi Sinha : Sure. And any word that you can throw on basically what your plan could be in 2016 that last time it was like you are expecting four horizontal rigs in Viper\u2019s take rates, everything including RSP Permian, I guess. So, do you think that would still be \u2013 might be the case? Travis Stice : Yes. Obviously, we have not provided a lot of \u2013 any color on 2016. But that\u2019s probably a reasonable assumption. Abhi Sinha : Sure. And then lastly, I just wanted to see has your hedging strategy changed a bit given the downturn that we have seen, I mean, when commodity picks up, I mean, do you think you might be willing to add hedges to Viper\u2019s volumes as well? Travis Stice : No, we won\u2019t hedge, Viper. We have been pretty clear that we believe the most efficient form of transfer to our unitholders is to remain un-hedged. And we are constructive at the Viper level on the price of oil long-term and we are going to stay un-hedged at the Viper level. And there is really nothing to provide hedge insurance against. I don\u2019t have any maintenance capital. I don\u2019t have any IDRs or anything that would need to preserve. I just want to pass in the most efficient possible manner that I can revenue from mineral production back to my unitholders. Abhi Sinha : Sure. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much, sir. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Oatman of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Ryan Oatman : Hi, good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Oatman : At the risk of beating a dead horse, I would like to touch a little bit on the spacing a little bit more. I see Slide 15 kind of going through the stacked pay potential in Spanish Trail. I was wondering if you could provide any insight as to whether the spacing varies by area, whether the mineral ownership helps you there, whether say in Upton County, you would see the spacing similarly or different and if so how? Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, you are right. I mean, the mineral ownership obviously helps on the spacing, but really when we look at the spacing, we would kind of look at all aspects, how much oil in place and thickness per zone and what kind of half length we think we are good. So, specifically to Upton County, generally in most of the zones, where we are at in Upton, the pay is a little thinner in both the Wolfcamp B and in the Lower Spraberry. And we have drilled a lot of Wolfcamp B wells down in Upton County. We actually did that on 880-foot spacing and just because that the B was thinner there and we thought we had a fairly good frac area. And as we look back on it, we really haven\u2019t seen any interference down in Upton County and the B. And so maybe we should have developed that a little tighter than we did. So, as we have got one Lower Spraberry well in Upton, we have just completed two more. We will have some results on in a few months. We drilled those at 660-foot spacing. So, we will test a little tighter spacing down in Upton in the Lower Spraberry than that we did in the B. And we will just see how the results work out. As we look at the Lower Spraberry across the rest of our acreage, it\u2019s fairly similar thickness up in the north area, up in Andrews and Martin and in Glasscock County as well. So, we will test tighter spacing there early on in those areas to guide us on what our ultimate development will be, but we think in those areas, it ought to be pretty similar to what we can \u2013 what we are doing in Midland County. Ryan Oatman : That\u2019s very helpful. And then just a clean up one for me, can you refresh me on your oil pricing exposure roughly how much is Brent versus LS versus Cushing versus Midland? Travis Stice : You are talking about our hedge, Ryan or hedge volumes or how much production we have? Ryan Oatman : No, I understand on the hedges. Travis Stice : Okay. Ryan Oatman : And I can kind of see that you guys hedge at different pricing points. I guess, I am just kind of trying to think about the physical marking kind of your ex-hedged volumes, where all that\u2019s going and what sort of pricing you are getting there conceptually? Travis Stice : Yes, we got \u2013 I am sorry, we got 8,000 barrels a day that go to Magellan Longhorn down to Houston Ship Channel. And that receives at LLS pricing, all the remaining barrels we produced at this point go to Cushing, Oklahoma. Ryan Oatman : That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing there are no further participants in the queue. I would like to turn the call over to Travis Stice CEO for any closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks, again to everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners Joint First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Tracy Dick, CFO; as well as other members of our exec team. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you, all, for listening to Diamondback's and Viper Energy Partners First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. It was another great quarter for Diamondback as we had production that exceeded expectations and we raised production guidance as a result of well performance, increasing completion activity and accretive acquisitions. We plan to add a second completion crew in June to go to work down the inventory of drilled but completed wells because cooperation with service providers had lowered our well costs 20% to 30% since the service cost peak in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we plan to add 2 horizontal rigs later this year. As a result of service cost concessions and efficiency gains, we are keeping CapEx unchanged despite increasing activity. The accretive acquisitions are located in the core of the northern Midland Basin primarily in northwest Howard County where economics and productivity rival those of Spanish Trail in the Midland County. I will talk more about the details of those acquisitions later in the call. I will now turn to our updated slide deck that can be found on our website. The Lower Spraberry shale continues to exceed our expectations. As shown in Slides 6 and 7, Lower Spraberry completions in Midland County continue to exceed our million-barrel type curve while those in Martin and Andrews County are tracking well above the 800,000-barrel type curve. As a reminder, about 2/3 of our completions this year will target the Lower Spraberry formation. Now turning to costs. AFEs are trending towards the low end of the $6.2 million to $6.7 million guided well cost range per 7,500-foot lateral. Several of our upcoming 7,500-foot lateral wells are on track to cost less than $6 million. We've also seen approximately 15% of cost concessions associated with LOE. Specific cost reductions are broken out on Slide 10. Since we're still completing wells drilled before we received cost concessions, we continue to expect to be within this guided well cost range of $6.2 million to $6.7 million for the year. We're projecting that at $60 a barrel for WTI, our cost savings and efficiency gains will allow us to generate project rates of returns comparable to those generated when WTI was at $75 a barrel. With the improvement in service costs and oil prices, we will resume our former pace of completion activity by adding a second dedicated frac crew next month to work down our backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells. We plan to increase our rig count from 3 to 5 rigs in the third and fourth quarter of this year and could potentially add another 2 or 3 rigs in 2016 to continue this growth trajectory. With the inclusion of our announced acquisitions, we now have an acreage footprint that can accommodate up to 10 horizontal rigs. We are reiterating our guidance for a total capital spend of $400 million to $450 million despite expecting to drill and complete more wells. Including the effect of the acquisitions, increased completion activity and strong productivity, we are also increasing our production guidance 11% at the midpoint to a range of a 29,000 to 31,000 BOEs a day. More than half of the increase is due to increased completion activity and productivity with the remainder of the increase coming from pending acquisitions which we expect to close by the end of June. Diamondback increased production 19% quarter-over-quarter to 30,600 boes a day, which exceeded expectations. The increase in production is primarily associated with the strong productivity of wells that came online during the quarter. Diamondback's track record for peer-leading efficiency and execution continues, resulting in cheaper wells and higher rates of return. Slide 12 shows that during the first quarter, we drilled 2 well pad with an average lateral length of 10,000 feet per well in 31 days from spud of the first well to TD of the second. In Martin County, we drilled a well with an approximate lateral length of 8,200 feet in 12 days, our best drilling performance to date on this acreage block. With these service cost reductions and continued efficiency improvements, rates of returns are now more than 85% per Spanish Trail Lower Spraberry well and nearly 200% where Viper owns the underlying minerals, as shown on Slide 13. Last night, Diamondback announced that we have acquired or entered into definitive agreements to acquire approximately 12,000 net acreage from private parties for $438 million, including 2,500 barrels a day of production on a 3-stream basis from 117 gross vertical wells and 3 gross horizontal wells. These transactions demonstrate both of our acquisition strategies : The bolt-on acquisitions in and around our core areas and adding new a development area. These assets, located primarily in northwest Howard County, provide us with approximately 232 net horizontal locations primarily in the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B formations on blocky acreage that is ideal for drilling longer laterals. Recent horizontal wells in the area of northwest Howard County confirm our geochemical data that indicates our 3 primary targets are well into the mature oil window. We expect EURs for these locations to range from 600,000 to 900,000 boes, which provides a low acquisition cost of approximately $2 a barrel. We expect roughly 40% of these locations to be drilled at 10,000-foot laterals, with the remaining locations being predominantly 7,500-foot laterals. Longer laterals support low refining costs, higher capital efficiency and stronger rates of returns. Additional upside may exist in the Middle Spraberry. There are over half a dozen Middle Spraberry wells drilled in and around the Spanish Trail acreage in Midland County with encouraging results. And the target looks very similar in Howard County. With over 25 wells completed in the immediate vicinity of the northwest Howard County, we consider this to be a proven area and the most derisked acquisition in Diamondback 's history. As shown on Slide 16, offset EURs range from 600,000 to 900,000 BOEs, which make the asset in the top quartile of our inventory with economics that are competitive with Spanish Trail. Slide 17 includes a cross section showing that the horizontal target shale formations in northwest Howard County are comparable to Spanish Trail in Midland County. Included in this acquisition is a 1.5% overriding royalty interest that we've offered to Viper Energy Partners for $34 million, which would leave Diamondback Energy with approximate 75% NRI. We expect to begin developing this acreage in 2016 or sooner depending on the timing of infrastructure needed to support a 2-rig program. You have heard me [indiscernible] all Tier 1, which is a type of acreage that generates the highest cash margins and rates of returns to our investors. As I have said many times before, Diamondback is committed to delivering best-in-class operations and the highest cash margins in the Permian Basin. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback's net income for the quarter was $5.8 million or $0.10 per diluted share after adjusting earnings for our non-cash market-to-market derivative losses of $25 million. Netting out the related income tax effect, our adjusted net income was $22 million or $0.38 per diluted share. Diamondback's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $110 million, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter due to increased production despite lower commodity prices. Our average realized price per BOE for the first quarter was $36.78 and due to the positive impact of our hedge position, our average realized price per BOE, including the effect of hedges, was $52.57. We are currently looking at opportunities to layer on hedges for 2016. We laid out the detail of our current hedge position in last night's earnings release and on Slide 22 of the presentation. Turning to cost. Our LOE was $8.14 per BOE for the quarter, a 17% reduction from fourth quarter of 2014. We continue to see cost concessions and to implement best practices on the acreage acquired in 2014. Learning from our experience of last year when we acquired nearly 300 gross vertical wells, we're making a minor adjustment to our LOE guidance as the result of acquiring 117 gross vertical wells in the announced acquisition. We think this new guidance of $7 to $8 per BOE is manageable given that we decreased LOE 17% quarter-over-quarter due to reductions in well servicing units, route about [ph], water, trucking, chemicals and other components. Our cash G&A cost come in at $1.20 per BOE while noncash G&A was $1.79 per BOE for the quarter, both within full-year guidance ranges. We believe that our total G&A of $2.99 per BOE is among the lowest in the Permian Basin on a per-BOE basis. In the first quarter of 2015, Diamondback generated $99 million of operating cash flow and $109 million of discretionary cash flow for $1.69 and $1.86 per diluted share, respectively. During first quarter of 2015, we spent approximately $149 million for drilling, completion and infrastructure. The majority of first quarter 2015 capital spend was associated with 2014 projects. We continue to expect our total capital spend to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million for 2015, unchanged from previous guidance due to cost savings and efficiency improvements. We anticipate our CapEx will trend down due to reduced rig count in the first half of 2015 and lower well cost. As of March 31, 2015, we had $162 million drawn on our secured revolving credit facility. Diamondback's agent lender under its revolving credit facility recently recommended a borrowing base of $725 million. However, the company intends to continue to limit the lender's aggregate commitment to $500 million. We believe our current volume availability provides us with plenty of liquidity. We estimate our 2015 year-end debt-to-EBITDA will be less than 2x. At current commodity prices, and with the current drilling program, we expect that we will turn cash flow positive in the second half of this year. I'll now turn briefly to Viper Energy Partners, which recently announced a cash distribution of $0.19 per unit for the first quarter. This exceeded expectation. During the quarter, cash available for distributions was $15 million and production increased 16% quarter-over-quarter to 4,844 BOE per day. Viper has no debt and an undrawn revolver of $110 million as of March 31, 2015. Viper's agent lender under its revolving credit facility has recently recommended a borrowing base increase of 60% to $175 million subject to the approval of the other lenders. Turning to Viper 's guidance, we expect 2015 volumes in the range of 4,600 to 5,000 BOE per day, up 10% from prior guidance. As a reminder, Viper does not incur lease operating expenses or capital expenditures. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing marks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. To summarize, this quarter, we've increased production guidance, resumed our completion activity and announced several Tier 1 acreage acquisitions. Service cost concessions and continued operational efficiencies have improved rates of returns equivalent to when WTI was $75 a barrel. As a result, we plan to pick up additional rigs later this year. Our intense focus on execution and generating differential cash margins has never wavered even as we go through this down cycle in commodity prices. I'm proud of all that our employees have accomplished so far this year and look forward to updating you on our progress. On behalf of the board and employees of Diamondback and Viper, I would like to thank you for your participation today. Operator, please open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Kelly of Global Hunter Securities. Michael Kelly : I think the first thing I'd ask is on your decision here to go back to work. And you mentioned in the release that you could see the rig count going from 3 all the way up to 8 rigs at some point in 2016. And I was just hoping Travis, you could detail kind of what the criteria is to get there? And how fast you might be able to ramp to 8 rigs. Travis D. Stice: Sure, Mike. It's really a function of a couple of things. We've got to maintain discipline on costs from the service community and commodity prices continue to need to improve. But on a general sense, as I outlined in our call, we believe we're generating rates of returns when commodity price was equivalent to $75 for WTI. So right now, we'll look at that. We've got a rig coming in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter. And certainly, as commodity price continues to improve, we'll be able to add late fourth quarter, early first quarter, additional rigs to primarily go to work in our newly acquired acreage in Howard County. Michael Kelly : Okay, Great. As a follow-up on that, just as you think about the balance sheet, and you mentioned in the release, too, that you'd look to fund the acquisition and, really, the pending ramp here in activity with potentially a combo of debt and equity. And when we ran your numbers last night, we saw that even after paying for this deal and ramping to 8 rigs over the course of next year, debt-to-EBITDA doesn't really even go over 2.5x. Just curious, what -- how you guys think about what's an appropriate target for leverage and the need to do equity going forward? Travis D. Stice: Yes, our stance on leverage really hasn't changed since before we took the company public. We always -- we state that we like to keep a leverage ratio of below 2. And I think that's logical to assume going forward as well. What's really unique about Diamondback is the different forms of financing that we have available to us. We have the opportunity to issue equity like we've done historically for acquisitions. We also have the high-yield market that's open to us. We have unused capacity on our revolver. And we also have a ownership in Viper Energy Partners. So we really got multiple ways to fund this acquisition going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from David Amoss of Iberia Capital Partners. David Meagher Amoss : Travis, you mentioned the infrastructure as kind of something that you need to get on the acquisition before you start to go to work there. Can you talk about what specifically you're looking for? And then what kind of time frame you're looking at to get that put in place? And is that something that Diamondback's going to do themselves? Or is that a third-party deal? Travis D. Stice: Sure. David, well, we set aside roughly $20 million in the acquisition to put an infrastructure in place that's necessary to support the -- a 2-rig horizontal program. And what that really entails is primarily the accumulation of stimulation fluid. So it's stim fluid accumulation ponds, it's pipes and facilities able to accommodate high volumes. This property was developed with vertical wells, and while we're pleased at the condition of the facilities associated with the vertical well development, most of those are going to need to be upgraded to accommodate significantly higher fluid handling capacity. So as soon as we close this deal, we'll go out at Diamondback, not a third party, and will begin that infrastructure. One thing I'm pleased with and we outlined in the acquisition is that we also acquired a saltwater disposal system for about $5 million. So we -- quite a bit. But can't start work until the close the acquisition, which is in the middle of June. That being said, we've got our plans firmly underway, at least on paper, to make a rapid transition to horizontally develop this acreage. David Meagher Amoss : Got it. And then looking at your Slide 17, I mean, it looks like the Wolfcamp B on the acquisition is actually considerably thicker than it is at Spanish Trail. Do you actually expect to be a more attractive target at the acquisition? How should we think about that going forward? Travis D. Stice: Really, when we look at these 3 primary zones here, if you look at Slide 16 and you look at the offset results, we put quite a few of them here nearest wells to this acreage block. The Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A are the 2 best performing zones. The Wolfcamp B is not quite as good as those other 2, but if you look at the location of the Wolfcamp B well, they're east of acreage block. And that Wolfcamp B does thicken as you go to the west. So we think the -- we've got a good chance of the Wolfcamp B being better on this acreage than it is on the wells to the east. So overall, we think we've got 3 really nice targets here. David Meagher Amoss : Great. And then -- and one last one if I can. Just as you accelerate and you think about the cyclical cost reductions that you've seen so far, how do you think about potentially locking those in? Or is there a point where you're getting a service company coming back and trying to claw a portion of that back? How do you keep the cost component in a place that you're comfortable with as you accelerate? Travis D. Stice: Well, we'll always try to hold the line on costs. Service companies are not willing to lock-in long-term contracts at what appears to be close to the bottom of the cost cycle. So it's, again, working very collaboratively with business partners because if costs continue go -- if cost go up faster than commodity price goes up, Diamondback, using our same mantra of capital discipline, we'll tap the brakes again. So I'd like to say yes, we've locked-in these low-cost for all time. But the reality is, is that you just can't do that right now. But again, the natural governor is increased activity versus laying rigs down, and that's certainly what drove the behaviors that got us to going back to work right now. And we have -- we still have that lever going forward as well, too. Operator : Your next question comes from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. John C. Nelson: Comments from most of your peers are that asset sales that have come to market over last 6 months had been situated more at the fringes of the field are lower in quality. I was wondering if you could first maybe comment on certainly, this was an attractive acquisition price. But do you feel that the -- what makes you so certain that these assets are high quality? And if you could, what IRRs you expect on that 600 million to 900 million MBOE -- I'm sorry, MBOE type curve at $60? And then secondarily, are we -- are you actually seeing a shift in the M&A pipeline to higher quality assets starting to make an entrance? Travis D. Stice: Yes, John, several good questions there. I'll try to take them in the order you asked them. As I outlined in my prepared remarks, this acquisition in northwest Howard County marks of the most derisked acquisition in Diamondback's history. And I don't make that statement casually. We've had -- got over 60 wells where we had open-hole logs where we were able to do our geochemical and petrophysical work supported by hole-core analysis that really highlighted the oil in place and the significance of these shale horizons. And also, while I think we've only put about 1 dozen or maybe 13 wells that have public data available in our slide deck, we really had over 25 slides in and around this area -- 25 wells in and around this area that's had IP-30s and established production that allowed us to go in and put reserve forecast on those wells. And so we've never had that many data points, both from a geoscience perspective and/or from a well performance perspective, that gave us confidence in this research block. And I know the there's a lot of question on what other quality deals are out in the M&A market, and my history has been that we don't really talk about acquisitions that are underway. I can tell you, though, that my shareholders should expect that Diamondback is actively involved in the M&A arena. And we intend to continue to be so going forward. John C. Nelson: And if I could just... Travis D. Stice: John, I'm sorry. You had another question on rates of returns for those 600,000 and 900,000 type wells. They're going to be in that 40% to 70% range at today's price and today's service costs. So really, I didn't -- I made the comment that these wells were in the top quartile of Diamondback's Energy's portfolio, and it's supported when you look at these rates of returns. John C. Nelson: That's very helpful. And I was just hoping just get one clarification on your earlier comment. Would the addition of rigs 6 to 8 then be contingent on further improvement in commodity price? Or are you just saying that we need to sort of stay the course with this? Travis D. Stice: Yes, it's more of the latter. Operator : Your next question comes from a Dave Kistler of Simmons & Company. David William Kistler : One, congrats on a great acquisition. And obviously another stellar quarter, weather clearly didn't impact you guys, as others commented on. One of the things that I'm curious about is you ramped the rig count up, and in the past, you've talked about this. And as you continue to acquire, do you feel like you have the appropriate staff in place to run an 8-rig or even a larger rig program? If you could just refresh us in terms of what kind of capacity you think your staff has at this juncture. Travis D. Stice: Yes. You know what, as an executive team, we've sort of always talked about building a bandwidth that's capable of running 10 horizontal rigs. And so when I made the comment that we now have got an acreage footprint that supports a 10-rig program, I believe that we're close to having that bandwidth right now. There may be 1 or 2 additional key contributors that we need to add to kind of help support that. But yes, sort of in that 10-rig cadence is what we've tried to build the organization around. And I've just -- just as an aside to that, even though we talk about a bandwidth for a 10-rig program, really, when you look at the pace at which we drill these wells, I think a 10-rig program is really like a 15- or a 20-rig program just how fast that we can get these wells drilled, which is sort of why I highlighted the fact that we got 2 10,000-foot laterals drilled in about a month's time. So we keep an eye on that, on our organization. And again, we try to build it around that 10-rig cadence. David William Kistler : I appreciate that color. And then kind of following up on that, obviously, with the speed at which you're drilling, the inventory of wells that are producing right now, have you looked at building up? Or do you already have in place a kind of field or well control team to ensure uptime of the existing production? Obviously, as the footprint gets wider, that becomes harder to control. And just curious how you're thinking about that. Travis D. Stice: Yes. We've got on the production side what we call a PWIP, it's a production well improvement program, that's the PWIP plan that weekly and monthly goes through and analyzes the producing performance of all of these wells and then also does a detailed deep dive on any wells that have failed to try to be proactive in failure identification. Because really, it's that failure identification, pumping practices that eliminate those failures. Our -- most of these vertical wells we've acquired over the last 12 months have a failure rate of somewhere north of 1.5. And the wells that we acquired last year, those 300, I was looking at our first quarter report. And we've driven that well failure rate down from 1.5 down to, I believe, it's about 0.7 right now. So obviously, that has a very positive effect, particularly in the well maintenance category of LOE expenses. So we're closing in on 1,000 total well bores right now, and that's not a casual number to -- for our field organization to try to optimize. And to further make that a little bit more difficult is that we're all the way from Upton County now into the Howard County and into Martin County. So we're close closing in on about 9 counties where we operate wells. And so sometimes, that dispersion causes a little bit of a -- gives a little bit of efficiencies. But it's -- that's what we do though. We have Jeff White, he's our Vice President of Operations, and his whole organization is up to the challenge of making sure we can maintain best-in-class operations from our field organization's perspective. David William Kistler : One last one. Just relative to the ability to ramp up but also the ability to ramp down as you highlighted. The rigs that you'd be picking up, the completion crew that you're picking up, what kind of terms are you looking at on those? Are we talking well to well? Are we talking more a contractual over several months to a year? Any kind of color on that would be helpful. Travis D. Stice: Yes, we've got -- the rigs we've got that are coming on, they're all under different contract periods. And as we go from rigs 6, 7 and 8, we'll be picking those rigs up on a well-to-well basis. And that's one of the slides, and I can't remember which one it is, it references the rig cost. You can see that it -- our rig cost has only come down 3%, that's because most of those were under pre-existing contracts. As we continue to add rigs, one of the more significant cost savings we'll have is the day rate on the -- on those drilling rigs. The completion crew, we picked it up, we've committed to them that we've got a dozen-plus wells that we need to work off of in our inventory. And as long as the commodity price holds, we'll continue to work that. But they're not operating under any form of long-term contract. Operator : Our next question comes from Gordon Douthat from Wells Fargo. Gordon Douthat : As you look to ramp your rig activity, it looks as if there's a potential for 2 to go in Howard County. Just wondering beyond that, how you look to spread your rigs across your acreage. Travis D. Stice: Gordon, we'll always keep as many rigs in Spanish Trail as we can, which is somewhere, just from an operated perspective, a max of 2 to 3 rigs. And that includes that acquisition that we bought in the fourth quarter of last year, the Gridiron area and some of the acreage that's slightly outside the Spanish Trail. So we'll keep 2 to 3 rigs there. We'll keep probably 2 rigs up to the North bouncing around between Northeast Andrews County, Northwest Howard County, where we've got good $1 million [ph] barrel type wells there in the Lower Spraberry. We'll keep -- go to work one or so in the Glasscock County area. Again, that's a new acquisition that we had last year, and then we'll keep 2 in Howard County. So we'll have a couple that bounce around, and we'll keep I think 1 more rig in Southwest Martin County. And that should get you somewhere in that 8- to 10-rig cadence, depending on commodity price and service costs. Gordon Douthat : Okay, that's helpful. And then just wanted to get your thoughts on hedging. I know Tracy, you mentioned that you're looking to add some for 2016. And just wanted to get your thoughts on what you're looking for in order to get more aggressive with the hedging position next year. Travis D. Stice: Sure, we've kind of had an internal mark on the well, it's about $65 a barrel WTI. And I think this week, for the first time, hedges crossed over, the forward strip crossed over to about $65 and $65.50, something like that. I haven't looked at it today. But we're pretty close to the point at which I think we want to start building our hedge book. It's something I work with the board with a couple of times a week and just trying to keep them informed as well, too. Dave, the board, has guidance of -- to us, it's somewhere between 40% and 70%. And we're not anywhere near that in 2016. So I think we've got a nice little run in commodity price, we're watching it real closely, and potentially could start adding hedges in the not-too-distant future. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson of KLR Group. Gail A. Nicholson: As you increase that rig activity, really kind of looking at the '16 forward time frame, should we anticipate that the number of wells on your pads will also increase? Or how should we think about that? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Gail, I think the most efficient capital of that you can deploy is when you keep a rig on the pad as many times as you can. And sort of our sweet spot looks to be about 3 rig -- a 3-well pad. That takes in a lot of things, drilling, simultaneous operation with offset completions. And so as you -- as we continue to add and pick up rigs, more and more of our additional rigs will be on multi-well pads. In 2016, although we've not really looked at it in detail yet, and specially including this new acquisition, most of our rigs will be on multi-well pads. The only horizontal rigs that we have that won't be will be the ones that kind of bounce around a little bit in the Northeast Andrews County and Northwest Martin County. But other than that, we should be doing mostly pad work. Gail A. Nicholson: Okay, great. And then on -- just a standpoint -- I was wondering if you can give any update on the Lower Spraberry well in Dawson County and how that has performed. Travis D. Stice: Yes, the Dawson County well, it's been on for quite a while now. You get a really -- still continuing to perform in line with what we were projecting before, which is somewhere around that 600 MBOE type well, which again, at current commodity prices. I'd say above our threshold rate of return. It doesn't quite compete with some of our other Lower Spraberry result. But we think as hopefully, commodity price continues to improve, and over time, we'll develop that acreage block as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital Markets. Jeffrey Grampp : I was hoping to maybe get your thoughts on production growth throughout the remainder of the year, I know you guys don't like to give quarterly guidance, but looking like maybe 2Q, maybe a little bit stagnant as you start. And then maybe you just start working down the backlog. I assume second half will be stronger. And is the assumption that a lot that is probably going to hit 4Q? Or maybe some contribution in 3Q? Just kind of getting your thoughts on production cadence throughout the remainder of the year. Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, good question. And you're right, we don't give quarterly guidance. But I'll tell you as Diamondback kind of stood up earlier this year and said that capital disciplines matters and returns matters, we started deferring completions and laying rigs down. Most of the effects of that capital discipline decision are going to be felt in second quarter, and it's going to be measured by fewer wells completed in the quarter than we did in the first quarter. So I think your original assessment of how production profile's going to look is probably a good way to think about it. Whether it's exit or 4Q impact or early 1Q '16 impact, it will -- as you increase rigs and increase completion activity, we'll go back to that volume building trend. Jeffrey Grampp : Okay, that's helpful. And on the acquired properties, obviously getting a nice leg of production there. Do you guys kind of have a sense for what the base decline is with those existing wells? Seems like with the -- a mix in newer horizontal and I guess some legacy verticals there. Travis D. Stice: Obviously, the biggest majority of those are vertical wells. And the horizontal wells that are on there right now are some non-operated wells where we have a low working interest, so that's very little impact. Most of those vertical wells have been on production for 4 or 5 years. So we're down in kind of that 15%, 20% decline rate on the PDP. Jeffrey Grampp : Okay, perfect. And then last one for me. I guess with the planned acceleration in activities, is there an increased interest on your end to test more downspacing, other types of upside projects across your acreage position? Or is it still just kind of going for the known quantities in your portfolio? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, that's a good question. I don't think we're ever satisfied that we're extracting all that we can out of these unconventional rocks. So we continue to try different things. More, I would say, tweaks as opposed to complete overhauls on our completion strategy. Again, Jeff White and his completion organization, they stay up to speed on all the ongoing completion enhancements that are taking place out here in the Permian. And on selective instances, they try that, and we monitor it so that we make sure we can get good feedback on the changes that were made. But in the general sense, it's more tweaks than complete overhauls. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Connolly of Clarkson Capital Markets. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Can you give us an update on the Lower Spraberry wells you drilled on 500-foot spacing? And if you think that the 500-foot spacing is applicable across your acreage? And if you're not there yet, kind of what you need to see before you get comfortable with that? Travis D. Stice: Yes, if you look at that slide that shows our Lower Spraberry results for Midland County, I believe it's in Slide #6. That 500-foot spacing is -- the ST West, 7-1LS and 7-2LS, we've show the average of those 2 wells on that pad. And you can see so far -- I mean, it's tracking with the results of the other wells. That's still early. We've got somewhere around 150 days of production on those 2 wells, they're very encouraging results so far. So right now, the Spanish Trail area, we're going forward with the 500-foot spacing and we'll be testing that 500-foot spacing in our other areas as well. We recently completed a microseismic survey on a 3-well pad in Spanish trail that we actually did at 660-foot spacing. We're just now getting the results back on that. So we'll take a hard look at the results of the microseismic and refine our spacing as we go forward. Jeffrey R. Connolly: Okay, great. And then Diamondback's talked about being cash flow neutral or positive in the second half this year. Is that still the case if you choose to add the 2 rigs? And then are those 2 rigs included in the $400 million to $450 million CapEx program? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Jeff, as was indicated in our prepared remarks, this increased activity will still be within our original guided CapEx range because of the cost concessions that we've seen today. So that's a not too subtle message that we're able to stay within our original CapEx guidance, not increase it, but get increased activity. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann of Scotia Howard Weil. Joseph Bachmann : Travis, just a quick question on the acquisition. Just wondering, the vertical well control, is that across the acreage to give you enough confidence in that cross section that you provided, I guess, on Slide 17, with the different targets? Travis D. Stice: Yes, absolutely, Jeb. We've got real fulsome analysis from a cross-section perspective, both East to West and North to South, across this acreage block. So extremely good coverage with vertical well control. And then again, as I highlighted and then we've included in our slide deck, there's enough offset production data as well to further enhance our confidence. Joseph Bachmann : And then just briefly on kind of the completion design. Can you update us on what you guys are doing right now to maybe help improve those EURs above what Ryder Scott has did -- put you at earlier this year? Travis D. Stice: Well, as I mentioned on the previous call, we're not making major overhauls to our completion design. We continue to go 300,000 or so, 300,000, 350,000 pounds per stage, our per-foot concentration is 1,200 to 1,500 pounds per foot. And we're predominantly using white sand in our Wolfcamp completions and brown sand mostly now on our Lower Spraberry completions. We continue to tweak the number of clusters between each stage and also tighten the interstage distances to get a few more fracs in there. And we've done that on a couple of 2-well pads now. And we're monitoring results real closely to see if tighter spacing has a corresponding impact to the EUR. Operator : Our next question comes from a Jason Wangler of Wunderlich. Jason A. Wangler: Travis, just had one for you. Obviously, coming back and starting with the inventory and then the second frac crew. Just curious, do you have a rough idea of what your backlog looks like now? And what you think it will look like on the steady-state basis as we get to the end of the year? Travis D. Stice: Yes, we're probably about -- we're probably in that maybe 15-plus range right now of wells waiting on completion. What's kind of a reasonable backlog per rig is around 2 to 3 completions behind each rig. That sort of seems to be the most efficient way for us to manage and being able to move the crew to the next well that's ready. And so just as a -- from a planning perspective, you got to look at 2 to 3 wells waiting on completion ahead of each drilling rig. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. We'll move on to the next question, it comes from Welles Fitzpatrick of Johnson Rice. Welles W. Fitzpatrick: Congrats on the strong acquisition. On the acquired acreage, do you guys own all depths? And if so, does the Cline rank anywhere on the to-do list? Travis D. Stice: Yes, I mean, it depends on the particular lease, but in almost all of them, we have leased, own them through the Cline. There is some, I'd say, some Cline potential, there has been some -- and I'd say reasonably good Cline wells south of our acreage. As you move north, the Cline gets to be more carbonate than shale. So we really like the A, B, Lower Spraberry and Middle Spraberry here more than the Cline. But in at some commodity price, there probably is some prospectivity for the Cline. Welles W. Fitzpatrick: Okay, perfect. And then just one more. Did you say that the $20 million in infrastructure spend was included in the $438 million number? Travis D. Stice: Well, as we modeled it from the CapEx spend going forward, we included -- that's a CapEx number that we think we'll have to have going forward. So it's not included in the $438 million. It's just a CapEx number that we think is going to be spread out over the next 12 to 24 months as we initiate and implement that infrastructure spend. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Richard M. Tullis: Two quick questions. So this acquisition should bring your total to around 89,000 net in the Permian. You looks like you let a couple thousand acres go in February in Crockett County. What's the outlook for any additional exploration of acreage this year? Particularly interested in acreage in Central Andrews. I guess you have a maybe upward of 10,000 acres there. What's the outlook for that? Travis D. Stice: Sure, Richard. We kind of joke around here that we're hunters, not farmers, and so we're never really satisfied that the inventory that we've got is the right number. We're always looking to expand our footprint by doing accretive acquisitions. I'll let -- we will continue to be active in M&A. We're not necessarily what you'd categorize as an exploration-oriented company. But we're going to continue to be active in the M&A market starting today. So I'll let Russell answer the -- kind of the question on Central Andrews County. Russell D. Pantermuehl: From -- if you remember, in Central Andrews County, we've tested the Clearfork there with a couple of horizontal wells. And I think as we've mentioned before, that second Clearfork well that we drilled in the Lower Clearfork Shale has continued to perform well, the declines are actually much flatter than we originally projected. And so that Clearfork really looks -- is looking better and better all the time based on the performance of that second well that we drilled. So at current commodity prices, it's certainly economic, but not in the top quartile of our inventory. So you probably see us test the Clearfork again sometime over the next year to kind of confirm those results, but not a '15 program at this time. Richard M. Tullis: Okay, Russell. That's helpful. And then just lastly, Travis, I'm not sure if you touched on this a little earlier. But of the -- how do you split that, say, between internal efficiencies versus vendor reductions? Travis D. Stice: That's a good question, Richard. I think the split is probably closer to 80-20, maybe 90-10. But you have to keep in mind that as we've built this company over the last 3 years, our efficiencies [ph]. So we've never satisfied that we've got all the pennies picked up off the ground from an efficiency perspective. But probably 80-20, 90-10, with the larger number being associated with service cost concessions. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : Travis, I was just wondering that slide you have that shows the downspace and stack pay potential, I guess my question, are you still pretty optimistic about on the 3 areas there on the Middle Spraberry going from 6 to 8 per section? And then looking at the lower 8 to 10? And then obviously, the Wolfcamp from 4 to 8? On not just in Spanish Trail, but your thoughts about sort of that similar downspacing if I look at either Southwestern or Northwest Martin or Howard or Glasscock. Travis D. Stice: Yes, Neal, maybe we're a little conservative in the way that we look at the numbers of laterals that go across the section. We sort of use that as a risking mechanism. But the least we know about a zone, the fewer laterals we'll put in. And I think industry has shown, if the shale works and generates the economics, somewhere between 6 and 10 is going to be the right number. So Middle Spraberry, while we've got a couple of wells drilled and some testing going on. We're -- we just don't have a lot of information there. And so I think industry has shown, not only in the Permian but also on all the other basins with these shale development, that they tend to get tighter, not broader, over time as the -- as more and more wells get drilled. So most of our well cadence or well counts in our inventory are biased upwards given success in each of these productive zones. Neal Dingmann : Got it. Then just lastly, maybe for you or Tracy, just on your comment about the positive second half cash flow. What -- I forget, what commodity prices are you using there? Are you assuming current cost? Travis D. Stice: Yes, current cost, but we modeled it -- we modeled the company at $50 flat. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Rowe of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Michael J. Rowe: I just had a quick follow-up question on the Howard County acquisition. So the acreage there looks to have very good oil in place and thermal maturity. Can you just talk to the porosity and permeability that you're seeing there? And maybe kind of compare that to the Glasscock asset that you acquired last year? Russell D. Pantermuehl: Really, what we've seen on the porosity side, it's fairly similar. Permeability is a tough thing to measure, but when you look at the well performance of those offset horizontal wells to our Howard County acreage it obviously looks like the perms are very good in that area based on the well performance. If you remember, in Glasscock County, the overall Wolfcamp section in particular, is thicker. You've actually got more oil in place in Glasscock County. There's not -- hasn't been near as much horizontal activity in the area, although there's some recent Apache well results within couple of miles of our acreage block there in Glasscock County. And based on the public data from those wells, it's very, very encouraging. And so we're still very excited about our Glasscock County acreage. And we'll be drilling our first wells there in the second half of this year. Michael J. Rowe: Okay, that's helpful. And just last question related to Viper. It's my understanding there's not much cash flow associated with the override from this Howard County acquisition embedded in 2015 production guidance that's been revised for Viper. But I'm just kind of curious if you could talk about how you foresee the cash flow profile of that asset growing and maybe how you came up with the valuation for the -- I think it was the $33.7 million. Travis D. Stice: Mike, one of the things that we were so excited about at the Viper level was that the growth profile associated with the overrides that Diamondback has offered to Viper actually exceeds the growth profile that's embedded in the legacy Viper assets. Now that we've been looking across the country for the last 9 months for acquisitions at the Viper level, it's pretty unique to find this kind of growth profile. And so as we outlined our Viper strategy, we wanted to get the assets that are operated by a competent operator. In this case, it's Diamondback Energy. We wanted to get assets that are actively being developed or on the verge of being developed, which this -- as Russell has highlighted, with a lot of activity, it's going to be occurring here in the near future. And the high oil component, which is like I said, around 75% to 80%. So this acquisition fit in the -- in all of those -- into all of those categories. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael A. Hall: I guess one question. I just wanted to try and get at was given the accelerated ramp in '15, slightly accelerated, and the outlook for potential additional rig adds in '16. Any color or commentary on what that could do for 2016 production growth? And what that might look like in 2 different scenarios? Travis D. Stice: Yes. Michael, again, we've not -- in early May, we've not really focused on exactly what 2016 is going to look like. But I think as we march along this year, as we pick these additional rigs up, we'll be able to provide a lot more clarity about what 2016 is going to look like. But one thing I do know is as you add rigs and you increase completion activity, volume growth responds accordingly. So certainly, our expectations are under -- accelerating rigs and accelerating completion activities that our growth profile is going to continue going forward in the future. Michael A. Hall: Make sense. Figured it was early, but worth a shot. And then I guess, I was also curious on your views on kind of concurrent completions in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry and how important that is, or not important, as you think about full development on the various assets. Travis D. Stice: Yes. I think when you look at our assets on the Western side on the Northern Midland Basin, you've got some pretty nice distinctive zones with some nice frac barriers in between the Wolfcamp and, say, the Lower Spraberry, for example. As you move east and you get some thickening in the shale depositions, it starts to make more sense to us to do stacked laterals. And so while we've not definitively come out and exactly spelled out what our strategy is going to look like, I think it's more likely than not that we'll be drilling stacked laterals, not only in Glasscock County but also in this Northern -- Northwest Howard County block as well. Michael A. Hall: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost front, what's the average AFE you guys are expecting now in second half for a 7,500-foot lateral? Travis D. Stice: Yes. We'll probably be at the low end of our guidance. We're -- what did we say? $6.2 million to $6.7 million, we'll probably be at the low end of that. There's a highlight in my prepared remarks. We've got some wells that we're finalizing right now and although costs aren't in right now, the -- look like they'll be in the $6 million range. But they're not -- we don't have all the cost in on yet. But as I said in my prepared remarks, because we're completing a lot of wells that were drilled last year before all the cost concessions were in, we're still going to stay within that guidance for 7,500-foot well of $6.2 million to $6.7 million. Michael A. Hall: Okay. And then last one on my end is just around completion capacity. You've got the rigs outlined or contracts, it sounds like, are lined for the back half of the year. Any needed additional completion capacity? And have your arranged for that? I imagine there's plenty available. Travis D. Stice: Yes. That part is a factor. There is plenty available. But our cadence sort of supports 1 dedicated crew for about 2 to 3 rigs. And so we get up to the 8 rig, we'll probably have a 2 fully dedicated crews and 1 probably partial dedicated crew. And then as you would love [ph], that kind of ratio of 2 to 3 dedicated -- 1 dedicated crew to 2 to 3 rigs is a good planning number. Operator : And at this time, I'm not showing any further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing comments. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again for everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thanks, everyone, and look for to talking to you again in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint second quarter 2015 conference call. During our call today, we'll reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Tracy Dick, CFO, as well as other members of our executive team. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures and the reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's and Viper Energy Partners' second quarter 2015 conference call. Before we begin, I would like to congratulate Mike Hollis on his promotion to Chief Operating Officer. As most of you know, Mike has been our Vice President of Drilling since September of 2011 and has been invaluable to our organization. As you're aware, commodity prices in the past 12 months have been volatile, decreasing over 50%. Our strategy has remained unchanged since before our IPO. We focus on stockholder returns, best in class execution, low-cost operations, and our conservative balance sheet that allows us to succeed in the current environment. The position Diamondback is in today is not just a result of our recent response to falling commodity prices but rather a reflection of the decisions we made over three years ago as we were building the company. When I started my career in 1985, oil price was in a freefall and oil was mostly below $20 a barrel for the next 15 years. Sound companies survived and some prospered. Those that prospered were the efficient, low-cost operators with good balance sheets and low debt. These companies also took advantage of the times and added Tier 1 core acreage to their inventory. That should sound familiar because that is exactly what Diamondback has done over the last three years. I fully expect that we will continue to prosper. Our business model is simply to convert resources to cash flow more efficiently than anyone else. Our remaining locations for the year are expected to generate in excess of a 40% rate of return at a flat oil price of $50 a barrel. This is why we resumed production growth and we will continue to grow as long as we provide attractive returns to our stockholders. We will continue to monitor the macro outlook and have the flexibility to adjust our program by responding prudently to market conditions. Additionally, most of our acreage is held by production, providing further flexibility in 2016. Our balance sheet, cash flow, and ample liquidity can support our reacceleration. We have additional non-debt, non-dilutive liquidity in our 88% ownership stake in Viper. As a result of decreases in cycle times from drilling optimization, completing additional wells, and the continued strength of our Lower Spraberry program, we are increasing production guidance for the second time this year to 30,000 BOE/D to 32,000 BOE/D from 29,000 BOE/D to 31,000 BOE/D previously, and plan to drill five more gross horizontal wells at the midpoint. As announced last quarter, we have closed on approximately 12,000 core acres in the heart of the Northern Midland Basin that we are excited to begin drilling later this year or early next year. Our track record of capital discipline and accretive acquisitions has enabled us to add acreage into the top quartile of our portfolio. I will now turn to our updated slide deck that can be found on our website. Slide six shows our current cost savings for drilling and completing a 7,500-foot lateral. We have captured 20% to 30% in cost savings due to cost concessions and permanent efficiency gains. We still expect our average D&C costs for the year to be within the $6.2 million to $6.7 million range for 7,500-foot lateral. This slide also shows our LOE cost savings. As our operations team has implemented best practices on the acreage acquired in 2014, LOE per BOE has decreased nearly 25% from the fourth quarter of 2014. We still anticipate averaging between $7 and $8 per barrel for the year. Slide seven shows that the returns on our current Spanish Trail Lower Spraberry wells are strong, even at today's oil prices. When you include the effect of Viper ownership and assume a $6 million well cost, Spanish Trail Lower Spraberry wells are able to generate nearly a 70% rate of return at a flat WTI price of $40 a barrel. The two rigs added to our program will be primarily drilling in our new Howard and Glasscock positions where we also expect robust economics. We are encouraged by the three tests of increased sand concentration in Spanish Trail. On average, we pumped about 1,900 pounds per foot on these wells compared to 1,300 pounds per foot in our standard completion design. These three wells in Spanish Trail are outperforming offset completions by an average of 15% to 20% for a similar increase in cost. We will closely monitor these results and will adjust our program accordingly. We plan to conduct further enhanced completions going forward. As a reminder, we decreased drilling and completion activity in the second quarter, primarily to realign service costs with depressed commodity prices. Slide 11 demonstrates how production last quarter decreased as fewer completions were placed on production. Diamondback's track record for peer-leading efficiency and execution continues, resulting in cheaper wells and driving differential returns for our stockholders. Slide 13 shows that, on average, we drill wells significantly more efficiently than offset operators in Midland, Martin, and Andrews counties. Turning briefly to Viper, production for the quarter was up 99% compared to production in Q2 2014. We are actively seeking accretive acquisitions for Viper that meet our criteria for packages in oil-weighted basins under active development by competent operators. You have often heard me speak about Diamondback's commitment to delivering best-in-class operations and the highest cash margins in the Permian Basin. Now more than ever, it's apparent that our focus on capital discipline and stockholder returns has enabled us to be very opportunistic during this downcycle. In fact, either way you look at it, Diamondback is positioned to succeed. When oil rebounds, we can quickly reaccelerate development of our core acreage. On the other hand, if commodity price remains depressed for prolonged periods, our strong balance sheet and track record for capital discipline put us in the position to acquire and consolidate assets accretive to our stockholders. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback's adjusted net income was $25 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Diamondback's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $110 million, which is up 6% from $103 million in the second quarter 2014. Our second quarter average realized price per BOE including the effect of hedges was $52.93. Our lease operating expenses were $7.51 per BOE, an 8% reduction from the first quarter of 2015 and a nearly 25% decrease from the high in Q4 of 2014. We continue to seek cost concessions and to implement best practices on acquired acreage. Our cash general and administrative costs were $1.24 per BOE, while our non-cash G&A costs were $1.58 per BOE, both within full-year guidance ranges. We believe that our total G&A of $2.82 per BOE is among the lowest in the Permian Basin. We have revised our DD&A guidance for 2015 to a range of $19 to $21 per BOE from our prior guidance range of $20 to $22 per BOE. This is a result of the impairment charge we recorded this quarter. We spent approximately $86 million for drilling completion and infrastructure and approximately $433 million for acquisitions. When you exclude the capital spent on acquisitions, we achieved positive free cash flow for the first time in our history. We continue to expect our total capital spend to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million for 2015, unchanged from previous guidance due to cost savings and efficiency improvements. However, we do expect we will be near the upper end of this range as we have increased our gross completion guidance to 60 to 70 from the prior range of 55 to 65. I'll now turn briefly to Viper Energy Partners, which recently announced a cash distribution of $0.22 per unit for the second quarter. This represents an approximate 6% yield when annualized based on the July 28 closing price. This is an increase of 16% from the $0.19 distribution declared in the first quarter. In the past year, Viper has paid $0.91 per unit to its unitholders. During the quarter, cash available for distribution was approximately $18 million. Viper has no debt and an undrawn revolver of $175 million as of June 30, 2015. In early July of 2015, Viper completed the purchase of an approximate 1.5% average overriding royalty interest on certain of Diamondback's acreage, primarily located in Howard County, for $31 million. Turning to Viper's guidance, we expect 2015 volumes in the range of 4,800 BOE per day to 5,100 BOE per day, up from the prior range of 4,600 BOE per day to 5,000 BOE per day. As a reminder, Viper does not incur lease operating expenses or capital expenditures. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. To summarize, our prior decisions have positioned Diamondback to succeed in these market conditions. We've preserved optionality either to increase activity levels or to spend within cash flow. Our wells are still highly economic, even at current oil prices. We have minimal drilling obligations, with most of our acreage held by production. And we continue to execute on the things we can control. We are excited to get to work in Glasscock and Howard Counties and we look forward to updating you on our progress. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I would like to welcome our new employees to Diamondback and to thank everyone for what they have accomplished during the first half of this year. On behalf of the board and employees of Diamondback and Viper, I would like to thank you for your participation today. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Dave Kistler from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. David W. Kistler: Good morning, guys. Travis D. Stice: Morning, Dave. David W. Kistler: Travis, just a follow up on a comment you made with respect to the strength of the balance sheet and the prospect for consolidation. Can you talk a little bit, given the history of the acquisitive nature of Diamondback, a little bit about where you see the M&A market? Similar to how we saw recalibration of service costs with lower commodity prices, should we see recalibration of M&A targets? And obviously, Diamondback, you guys are a premium currency out there. Just trying to think through how you look at the next three months, six months, 12 months. Travis D. Stice: Dave, that's a good question. My track record has always been not to talk about any specific deals we have going on, but it's also reasonable that every trade that occurs in the Permian Basin, Diamondback shareholders should expect that our fingerprints are all over them. With that being said, though, I think with the macro conditions that are going on globally right now and obviously the commodity price continuing to fall, I would think that would put somewhat of a dampening effect on the expectations of sellers. However, that didn't necessarily happen as much in the first quarter of this year but I would expect somewhat of a softening of the expectations from sellers as they go forward. Additionally, I think there's potentially going to be some more distressed assets that may be coming on the market late this year or early next year if we stay in a period of prolonged commodity prices. So I think there's going to be some opportunities for Diamondback shareholders. We're just going to have to wait and see how it all plays out and we get some solutions around some of the macro issues that I referenced. David W. Kistler: Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe also extend that over to Viper a little bit. With mineral interests and the pull-back in the commodity price and corresponding cash flow to those that hold mineral interests, does that actually open up that environment for an opportunity to find more potentially acquisitive transactions on the royalty front? Travis D. Stice: Well, if you go back to just the timeframe right after IPO, crude was in a pretty good decline right after Viper IPO-ed. And I think our experience shows that it's difficult to convince sellers to convert their ownership into Viper units when commodity price is still going down. I think you need a little bit of stability in the commodity price before you get increased interest from sellers or from guys that want to trade their interests for Viper units. But that being said though, our pipeline's still pretty full right now and we're pleased at the progress we've made in terms of furthering these deals along. We've not closed any and none have traded away from us either. So I think the market is a little bit in flux right now and so we're just going to kind of have to see, say, over the next several months whether or not we can be do an accretive deal for our Viper shareholders. David W. Kistler: Appreciate that. And one last one, just in the press release, you highlighted some of the positive downspacing results that you've seen so far. Can you talk a little bit about the length of time you need to see those wells produced before you can have confidence with officially highlighting potentially more inventory across your portfolio? Russell Pantermuehl : Hi, yeah. This is Russell. If you go to our slides deck, on slide eight we've changed it up a little bit on how we show that result. So we show, on average, for our 500 foot spaced wells versus our 660 foot spaced wells and our other singular wells that don't have any offsets, and to date, you really don't see any material difference. So the early results are encouraging but we really need more time and more data. The 500 foot spaced wells that we have right now are essentially two-well pads, so you don't have the full offsetting wells. We are continuing to drill 500 foot spaced wells in Spanish Trail and by the end of the year, we'll have a full half-section developed with five wells. So once we get those results, I think we'll have a more definitive answer, but we're certainly encouraged by the results so far, where we've got almost six months of data on the first 500 foot spaced wells that still look very good. David W. Kistler: Great. I appreciate that very much. Thanks for the added color, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Amoss from IBERIA Capital Partners. Your line is open. David Meagher Amoss : Morning, guys. Travis D. Stice: Morning, David. David Meagher Amoss : Travis, just trying to wrap my hands around potential scenarios in 2016. So two specific questions. First, can you kind of point us in the direction of your inflection points on the commodity and what it might mean in terms of activity levels, say, a $40 case and a $60 case? And then kind of same question on well costs. I know you said that your average well cost will be in your $6.2 million to $6.7 million guidance, but the leading edge is on the lower end of that range. So kind of update us on where you are and where you might go considering what's going on with OFS with the commodity going down recently. Travis D. Stice: Certainly, Dave. I'll answer those in reverse there. Our current well costs are below $6 million for a 7,500-foot well, and we kind of felt like that was going to be the bottom of well cost, but now oil has taken another leg down and I think it's reasonable to expect the service sector will respond with another stepdown in cost as well, too. What that'll be and when that will occur I'm not exactly sure. But I know if activity's going to continue, there's got to be another recalibration that falls in that $40 to $45 range. Again, you asked some specific questions on 2016. David, there's so much flux in the market right now, not only with the macro issues that we talked about with the previous question that I'm just not ready to talk specifically about 2016 looks like. What I've tried to communicate is that we focused on returns to our shareholders and to the extent we can still generate returns to our shareholders, we'll keep some level of activity in 2016. To the extent things haven't recalibrated, we'll show that same behavior we did earlier this year and we'll slow down our capital spending and we'll return to somewhere within cash flow or close to cash flow. So, I know that all of the questions on the call and you're curious about how to model 2016. The reality is we've got to get some stability in the marketplace before Diamondback's going to come out with a very prescriptive view of 2016. David Meagher Amoss : Okay, thanks. And then one quick follow-up: you guys have made great efficiency gains so far this year. Can you just kind of give us an order of magnitude in terms of what we can expect over the next 12 months? Travis D. Stice: Well, I already mentioned that if commodity price stays low, we think there'll be another 5% to 10% of cost concessions that will be offered up by the service sector. In terms of efficiency gains, we're probably somewhere around 30% or so right now of total cost concessions. And of that 30%, probably 10% or so is what we're going to call permanent savings. And we're looking to increase that number even further. That's not a new thing for us. We've been doing that all along, which is one of the reasons our execution performance is what it is. But we think there's still some more pennies to pick up and we intend to pick them up and pass them back on to our shareholders. David Meagher Amoss : That's helpful. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann: Morning, guys. Say, Travis, I saw just not too long ago this morning, I see Exxon's picked up looks like another 40,000 acres, says here, in the core Midland. I guess two questions around that. One, you can seem to see \u2013 I guess when you look at competition to find acreage either near or around you, how do you view it today versus let's say even a year ago when we were in a higher commodity market? Travis D. Stice: Well certainly, Neal, where Diamondback's almost 85,000 acres sit, most of that is in what the industry is defining as perhaps the most lucrative investment shale horizon in the U.S. And that viewpoint hasn't done anything but got stronger over the last 12 months, as Diamondback and other operators continue to post really impressive well results and cost performance on these wells. So I would say even in a backdrop of declining commodity prices, this rock continues to impress to the positive, and that just means that that makes the demand for that rock that's pretty tightly held even higher. And when demand is high for this kind of rock, it usually means prices stay high as well. Neal D. Dingmann: And, Travis, I guess on this one it shows they did an acquisition and a farm-in. I guess, are you open to any sort of type of acquisition? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, again, specifically we don't talk about acquisitions. But in a general sense, drill-to-earn where we can provide another operator our execution excellence, I think that's a meaningful way to move into acreage. So, yes, we've considered and offered numerous drill-to-earn type of opportunities. Neal D. Dingmann: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Kelly from Global Hunter Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Kelly : Thanks. Travis, you mentioned that Diamondback will continue to grow as long as you're seeing strong returns. And I'd just like to get your thoughts around that and how you think about what qualifies as a strong return. I think you mentioned 40% project IRRs for the rest of this year. What's your limit on that where you want to back off? And then on the other side of that, talking about potentially going up to eight rigs next year, what you need to see to step on the gas and maybe accelerate the rig count, just from that returns perspective? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Mike, I did mention that the remaining wells we have to drill this year are all somewhere between 40% and 50% rate of return and it's hard to argue with that kind of returns to not continue to deliver that to my shareholders. So if we stayed at being able to generate rates of returns that robust, I think you'd look for us to continue to stay at either the level we're at right now and maybe even a slight increase. To get to the seven rigs, eight rigs, nine rigs, we've got to have another recalibration of service cost and commodity price. And I'm not sure exactly what oil price that translates to, but that's how we're looking at the world right now, Mike. Michael Kelly : Okay. Appreciate that. And let me just ask you on the efficiency front, if you could talk about cycle times now just spud to TD where they are now or where do you expect to be going into 2016 versus maybe where it was as you entered 2015? Just talk about the overall improvements you've seen there. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, we're currently using for our planning purposes about 18 wells per year per rig. We were using about 12 wells per rig last year and we're now about 18 wells per rig. And we've got actually designs on as many as two wells a month per horizontal rig for a 7,500-foot lateral. So we're continuing to push the envelope and that's where we're at right now, Mike. Michael Kelly : Okay. Appreciate that. And congrats to Hollis University (26:30) on the promotion there. Well deserved. Thanks. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Wangler from Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Jason A. Wangler: Hey, good morning, Travis. Was curious on the triple-stacked laterals. As you see that come online and watch that, is that something that you'd look to maybe kick off as a program going forward as maybe the best way to develop these, given that all of those formations are really showing some good results? Or just what are your thoughts around if that's successful what we're looking for going forward? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Jason, I think that's a reasonable expectation. Certainly as we move into Glasscock and Howard County, triple and quadruple-stacked laterals appear to be the best way to go. One of the reasons is that each of the zones there are so close in their economic performance that the returns you get from each zones are very similar, so it makes more sense to try to get as many of those up and down as you can while you got the rig parked at the surface. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. And you mentioned, obviously, the good results so far at least with the higher sand content. Are there any other things that you're seeing besides that that you're maybe still tweaking as you work on these completions? Or are you pretty much pretty happy with you're seeing and just kind of doing a few one-offs, if you will, to see if things are going to even get better? Travis D. Stice: I think we've got a really good completion organization that's never satisfied with what the current thinking is. They're always trying to tweak. And there's things with fluids, there's things with sand concentration, there's things with cluster spacings, all of which they continue to try to figure out ways to get more oil out of the ground cheaper. And they've done a good job so far and I look for them to continue to push the envelope on the completions side. But there's not one particular technology that I'd point to that we'd want to highlight right now. Jason A. Wangler: Great. I'll turn it back. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gordon Douthat from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on kind of the maintenance CapEx levels you guys foresee going forward? Just trying to get a sense on if commodities were to stay low at these levels, at what rig counts would CapEx levels would you need to keep production flat as you look into 2016? Travis D. Stice: I think if you just look at what we did in the second quarter, where Tracy highlighted that we were cash flow positive in the second quarter, somewhere between two horizontal rigs and three horizontal rigs, depending on how fast we continue to drill these wells, but somewhere between two horizontal rigs and three horizontal rigs would keep our production flat. Gordon Douthat : Okay. Thank you. And then with the new completion designs, with the greater proppant loadings, what do you need to see there to do that across all your completions? Yeah, I guess that's my question. Russell Pantermuehl : As we've said, we've done it on three wells in our Spanish Trail area, all of the Wolfcamp B, the early results went good. We just need a little more time to make sure it truly is incremental reserves as opposed to just acceleration. But as we mentioned, we've got additional tests planned for the remainder of this year, not just in the Wolfcamp B but also in the Spraberry. So in this low commodity price environment we just want to make sure that for incremental dollars that we are achieving incremental returns, so we'll continue to monitor. Gordon Douthat : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson from KLR Group. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning, everyone. The five additional completions added in 2015, should we assume those are more back-end loaded in the fourth quarter and more additive to 2016 production versus 2015, or how should we look at that? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Gail, that'll be late 4Q, so it'll be exit rate impact and then 1Q 2016 impact. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then you talked about the current commodity price environment, there would need to be another kind of recalibration of service costs and lower well costs to kind of support acceleration of activity. I'm just kind of curious on what's left to give on the service environment? I mean I know most of these guys have cut pretty decently, some guys are below maintenance CapEx on some of their equipment. And then when you kind of look at the current environment is there any concern kind of in the couple years forward out , like, maybe 2017 timeframe that because the cuts have been so dramatic that there's going to be a lack of equipment from that standpoint? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, just in reverse order there, Gail, Yeah, I think there could be a lack of equipment, particularly on the pressure pumping side, because that equipment is \u2013 the stuff that's working right now, that's pretty extreme environments that they have to work in. And there's not a lot of capital investment right now to replace pressure pumping equipment. So when oil responds, and it will, and activity picks up, we as an industry are going to have to figure out how to meet that increased activity on the pressure pumping side. I believe rigs are probably right behind that, but there's still a lot of rigs out there right now that aren't working. And then how much the service sector can continue to go down? I don't know, Gail. You're going to have to ask those guys how much more concessions they can give to allow it to go to work because that's essentially what the industry is saying is that if you want steady work probably at these oil prices, there's probably another leg down in costs that are going to be expected. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then just one quick clarification. We saw the oil composition volumes \u2013 oil composition and percentage of volumes tick down this quarter. It was up 1Q versus 4Q. Going forward, should we kind of think you're back into that more normalized 75% range? Just out of curiosity. Travis D. Stice: Sure. Yeah, we went back and looked at all of 2014, each quarter. Besides the first quarter of 2014, we averaged right at that 75% oil. As you recall, we had a nice volume beat in the first quarter, and one of the reasons that we did have such a good volume story was we brought on several multi-well pads early on in the quarter that came on at extremely high oil cuts. We've looked at July, we were running right around 74.5%, 75% and so far in August, we're running at about 75%. So consistent with our guidance, I think, we ought to be using around 75% oil. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Rezvan from Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. Tim Rezvan : Hi. Good morning, folks. I had a quick question. We haven't heard anything on Howard County. I know it's really only been six weeks since you closed that deal. I'm just curious how you're thinking about any activity on that area, I guess over the next, call it, six months to 12 months? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. We plan to have a rig there really late, late fourth quarter or certainly early first quarter. And depending on what our rig cadence looks like in 2016, we'll either have one rig or two rigs working in Howard County. Tim Rezvan : Okay. And then have you determined kind of what zones you would attack first? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. We'll go over there and do triple \u2013 probably triple-stacked laterals in the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then a question on the Lower Spraberry. I know around year end 2014, and please correct me if I have numbers wrong, I think you \u2013 there was talk about 20 Lower Spraberry PUDs on your books and I think you talked about having about 275 sort of engineered locations that you felt were fully derisked. In your presentation, you talk about, I think, a 368 location count that could go up another 80-plus locations with downspacing. Are those \u2013 do you consider those all derisked based on your operator activity? Or kind of like, how comfortable do you feel with the entirety of your Lower Spraberry footprint? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, the 260 locations, those we feel really good about because we've got tests in each of those areas, those are the kind of the western side of the basin, Midland, Martin, Northeast Andrews County. So as you know, we've got quite a few Lower Spraberry wells in Spanish Trail, we've got our tests in Southwest Martin as well as offset operators. We've drilled some more wells up in Northwest Martin that just have been on now for about three weeks that look real good. So, yeah, we feel really good about the western side of the basin. We've also got offset operator results on the eastern side of the basin, particularly in Howard County. There's not as many wells in Lower Spraberry and Glasscock, but you've got the Pioneer Lower Spraberry wells, that's up a little bit northwest of our acreage, that looked really good. And based on all our petrophysical work, we feel good about Glasscock as well. I think the questions there in Glasscock are more about what the ultimate recoveries will be. We certainly feel like the productivity is going to be pretty good there. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff S. Grampp: Morning, guys. Wanted to circle back on the triple stack concept and maybe just pad development in general. Just kind of wondering how you guys are thinking about balancing the longer spud-to-sales times of larger pads versus translating that into cash flow. In the near term, what's kind of your sense for an average pad size that you guys are comfortable with, given the kind of four-rig or five-rig program that you guys are moving towards? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Jeff, it looks like our most frequent pad size will be either three wells or two wells going forward. And that does have an impact on cycle time. But again, as we've demonstrated, we continue to drill these wells faster and faster. And so we're trying to offset some of the inherent delays with pad drilling by shorter cycle times associated with the drilling and completion operations. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. And then wanted to get your thoughts on hedging for 2016. Obviously, I know right now is probably not a good time to be layering anything on, but I think in the past, you talked about maybe $65 was kind of a number you thought would interest you in adding some hedges. Has that changed at all with the recent leg down you've had on your cost structure, or what are your thoughts as it stands today for hedging moving forward? Travis D. Stice: Right. Yeah, your first comment was still good, layering hedges on today, I think the quote I saw morning was $50 a barrel of whatever. So we're a lot more constructive long term on oil prices than $50 a barrel. So, Jeff, as I communicated in my prepared remarks, we've got a balance sheet that allows us the opportunity to go either direction. We don't necessarily have to layer on a lot of hedges. We have another form of liquidity that's non-debt and non-dilutive in our Viper ownership as well, too. So we have levers to crank on that perhaps some others don't. But if oil is suddenly at $65 a barrel, I think I'd get pretty interested in putting some hedges on for next year. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. That's helpful. And then one more if I can sneak it in on the Viper side. Just wondering with this most recent dropdown of the override, curious to get a sense for what you think the opportunity set is for similar type of transactions between the companies moving forward with the existing assets that you guys have? Travis D. Stice: Well, we've continued to look at the value proposition in doing joint bids with Diamondback and Viper. And we think that that's a real meaningful way to continue to acquire, where Viper can bid on overrides of a property and Diamondback buys on the standard leasehold, typically burdened at 25%. And a good example of that is what we did in that recent acquisition in northwest Howard County. We think that's the business model going forward, and we're pushing on that lever pretty hard. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question come from Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious on the 500-foot spacing tests, can you just remind me on your views on the Wolfcamp and any plans to test 500-foot spacing in the Wolfcamp at any point? Russell Pantermuehl : At this point, we're pretty happy with our 660-foot spacing based on the data that we have and data that other operators have as well. So at this point, we don't have any plans to try to tighten up the spacing in the Wolfcamp. Generally in the Wolfcamp, there's more barriers to frac height growth, so we think we're generating effective longer lengths. So that's the reason we think the 660-foot spacing is good in the Wolfcamp, at least in the areas that we have developed so far. As we get into Howard and Glasscock County, we'll just have to gather data there to give us a direction to go. Michael Anthony Hall : And are either the Wolfcamp or the Spraberry, are the thicknesses in either of them such that you might be able to do some sort of stacked-staggered configuration? Russell Pantermuehl : As you know, as we've indicated before, the Wolfcamp, particularly in the Glasscock County, stuff is quite a bit thicker. So the plan there would be to do a staggered pattern within the A and B in those areas. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And the 500-foot wells are actually outperforming your curves a little bit on that slide eight. Is there anything to read into that or is that just normal distribution of results? Russell Pantermuehl : I would say that's too early to tell. It could be just normal variation in reservoir quality. It could also be, too, that we're getting some enhanced fracturing at the tighter spacing as well. But, again, just need more well data to figure that out. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And then with the 660-foot spaced wells that are on that chart, do they have offsetting wells on both sides? Russell Pantermuehl : Generally they do not. But as we've looked at the performance, those are generally three-well pads. And so, in general, the middle well of the three-well pads is performing similarly to the outer wells up to this point. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And then on the quarter itself, was there any material amount of downtime from frac protect or anything along those lines that we ought to keep in mind? And then is that something that might become a greater phenomenon to be aware of as you move forward in a more focused manner and a more development type manner in Spanish Trail and other places? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Michael, Diamondback, we've got almost 175 horizontal wells drilled on our acreage right now. So the effect of watering out these offset horizontal wells, it's material, but we're also experienced enough in it now that we provide coverage for that in our guidance. We take that into account. So I wouldn't expect any more or less going forward than what we've experienced in the past. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And if we're thinking about that downtime and how you factor that into your modeling, is there any way to quantify it relative to, let's say, the type curves on slide eight that are normalized for operational shut-ins? What sort of percentage downtime or I don't know what sort of factor you would apply to that in a hypothetical case. Travis D. Stice: Michael, what we always try to do on our existing production is what we just \u2013 the PDP production line, we always haircut that a little bit to account for weather interruptions and standard oil field occurrences. And then when we look at the new wells, we typically risk those even a little bit heavier to account for that water-out effect that you asked about earlier. It varies a little bit and we go back every year and look at what the effect is, and we adjust it going forward. But it's something that we do here internally. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. Fair enough. And then you mentioned a couple times the potential to use Viper units as a source of liquidity. I just wondered if you could provide additional color around your thinking there in the context of the potential to use that as a source of acceleration capital in 2016. Just any other color you could provide on that would be appreciated. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Sure, Michael. It's just a tool we have in our tool kit that we don't think anybody else has that as I focused on, it's non-dilutive and it's non-debt. We recognize that. We own something \u2013 we own 88% of something that's worth over $1 billion. And that just provides us a lot of optionality going ahead. So I can't provide exact color on how we might ultimately use that, but it's certainly a tool that we have. Michael Anthony Hall : Fair enough. Appreciate it. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Crystal. Thanks again, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Candace. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint third quarter 2015 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO, and Tracy Dick, CFO, as well as other members of our executive team. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures and the reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's and Viper Energy Partners' third quarter 2015 conference call. Since the beginning, Diamondback has focused on stockholder returns, best-in-class execution, low-cost operations, and maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Today, this focus enables us to be in a position of strength as a stable and liquid company with high-quality acreage and a deep inventory of profitable horizontal locations. As I've said in the past, Diamondback is not about growth for growth's sake. Accelerating activity in a depressed commodity environment is not a prudent use of stockholders' capital. As you recall, at this time last year Diamondback communicated that we would not accelerate activity until service costs recalibrated and commodity prices improved. We continue that same capital discipline today while at the same time we keep improving our efficiencies. We will average four rigs during the fourth quarter and are currently running one completion crew. At this time, we intend to enter 2016 operating four horizontal rigs and one completion crew but we will adjust our plans as the environment warrants, consistent with our practice of capital discipline. As illustrated on slide five, we've run sensitivities from two to eight rigs in 2016 depending on oil prices. We have also shown the number of economic locations at each commodity price range, highlighting Diamondback's high-quality inventory. Our historical decision to manage the balance sheet in a conservative manner has put us in a position of strength today as we look at the different outcomes for next year. We would like to see a sustained shift in commodity prices before adjusting capital allocation in a meaningful way. Diamondback has a track record of accelerating quickly when rates of return improve. We will provide more fulsome plans for 2016 in the coming months. As mentioned in last night's press release, we now consider the Wolfcamp A and Middle Spraberry formations derisked on our Spanish Trail and Southwest Martin Country acreage. Slides six and seven show Diamondback's completions in the Wolfcamp A and Middle Spraberry as well as those of offset operators. Our first operated triple-stacked well was completed in Spanish Trail. The Trailand A Unit 3906, Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B have a combined average 30-day IP of 3,200 BOEs a day. The Wolfcamp A is tracking an approximate 800,000 BOE type curve while the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B are performing in line with our Ryder Scott type curves for Midland County of 990,000 BOEs and 638,000 BOEs respectively. Also in Spanish Trail, we completed our first Middle Spraberry test as a stacked lateral in conjunction with the Lower Spraberry well. The Spanish Trail West 705 Middle Spraberry has a peak two-stream 30-day IP of 851 BOEs a day. We are drilling our first four-well stacked pad in Southwest Martin County targeting the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B and expect to have results early next year. During the third quarter we began horizontal development of our Glasscock County acreage with a three-well pad that targets the Wolfcamp A, B and Lower Spraberry in a wine rack pattern. We intend to complete these wells later this year, and are currently drilling our second pad there. We will also test this wine rack concept on our recently acquired acreage in Howard County at the end of this year with a three-well pad that will target the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. Last night we announced that we expect our capital spend to be at the lower end of the guided range as we continue to do more with less. We now anticipate 2015 production to range from 31,000 to 32,000 BOEs a day, up from 30,000 to 32,000 BOEs a day previously. Diamondback's track record for peer leading efficiency and execution continues, resulting in more economic wells and driving differential returns for our stockholders. Slide eight shows that in our primary development areas in Midland, Martin and Andrews County, Diamondback continues to lead drilling efficiency coms when compared to offset operators. Just last week we reached 17,400 feet total depth on a 7,600-foot lateral well in Northwest Martin County in approximately nine days. I'm proud that as we've begun development in our new Glasscock County area, our first three wells reached TD faster than offset operators. Slide eight also shows our peer leading operating expenses. Our LOE in the third quarter of 2015 was $7.08 per barrel, a 6% reduction in the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in LOEs is attributed to our continued efforts to implement best practices on acquired acreage, reduce failure rates and optimize costs. Slide nine shows the reduction in LOE since their peak, as well as current cost savings to drill complete and equip a 7,500-foot lateral. We continue to capture incremental savings due to cost concessions and permanent efficiency gains, with current well costs down 25% to 35% from last year's peak. Average drill complete and equip costs for the year are expected to be between $6.2 million and $6.4 million for 7,500-foot lateral, as leading edge well costs now trend between $5.5 million and $5.8 million. Diamondback has built a high quality acreage base that puts us in a position of shrink with ample inventory, stability and liquidity to continue to differentiate ourselves in a disruptive environment. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa Dick : Thank you, Travis. Diamondback's adjusted net income was $26 million or $0.40 per diluted share. While much of our better than expected earnings was attributed to higher production and lower costs, some of it is due to lower DD&A from the impairment charge we recorded in the second quarter of 2015. As a result, we are revising Diamondback's DD&A guidance to arrange at $17 to $19 per BOE from our guidance prior of $19 to $21 per BOE. Diamondback's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $110 million, which is slightly above EBITDA in the third quarter of 2014, despite price realizations being significantly stronger in 2014. Our third quarter average realized price per BOE, including the effective hedges, was $47. Diamondback continues to have peer leading cash margin, driven by our focus on execution and cost optimization. Slide 10 shows that in 2Q 2015, cash margins exceeded the pure average by over 30%, while on slide eight, we show that year-to-date operating expenses were 17% lower than the pure average. Also on that same slide, we show that Diamondback continues to be one of the leanest operators, with year-to-date G&A nearly half of the pure average, and we generated more production per employee than our peers in 2014. In the third quarter of 2015, our cash G&A costs were $1 per BOE, while non-cash G&A costs are $1.40 per BOE. We spent approximately $80 million for drilling completion and infrastructure, and approximately $22 million for acquisition. During the third quarter of 2015, Diamondback achieved positive free cash flow for the second time in company history, excluding acquisition. We now expect our capital spend to be at the lower end of the previously guided range of $400 million to $450 million for 2015. Our peer leading leverage and track record of conservative financial management position us favorably in this environment. As part of the fall redetermination, our agent lender recommended a borrowing base increase from $725 million to $750 million. We have elected to maintain the $500 million commitment. At the end of the quarter, Diamondback has $529 million of liquidity, including $490 million available on our revolver. I'll now turn to Viper Energy Partners, which announced a cash distribution of $0.20 per unit for the third quarter. This distribution represents an approximate 5% yield when annualized based on the October 30 closing price. Viper has no minimum quarterly distribution or complex ownership hierarchy. The majority of cash flow is returned to unit holders through quarterly distributions, providing upside when oil prices rebound. Slide 13 shows how Viper's distribution remains resilient despite lower oil prices due to organic production growth. Spanish Trail remains one of the most economic areas in the Permian Basin and we expect the operators will continue to drill there. Viper had $29 million drawn on its revolver as of September 30, 2015. As part of its borrowing base redetermination, Viper's agent lender recommended an increase from $175 million to $200 million. Turning to Viper's guidance, we are raising production guidance to a range of 5,000 to 5,200 BOE a day, up from prior guidance of 4,800 to 5,100 BOE per day. As a reminder, Viper does not incur LOE or capital expenditures. We've also lowered Viper's DD&A guidance for 2015 to a range of $17 to $19 per BOE from $20 to $22 per BOE previously. This is due to an increase in its reserves. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Tracy. This quarter was marked by improved performance in all areas of our business, efficiency gains in drilling performance, optimized costs and continued improvement of our average well. Our conservative financial management and capital discipline put Diamondback in a position to weather the low current commodity price environment, and we're poised to accelerate when price recovers. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I want to recognize each of our 139 employees for all the hard work they've done to continue our track record of execution and low-cost operations. The third anniversary of Diamondback's IPO was earlier this year in October. It has been an amazing three years, filled with many exciting success stories. I firmly believe Diamondback's best is yet to come. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Travis Stice : Thank you, John. John Nelson : I think after the August equity raise, a lot of us were expecting an acquisition announcement was probably looming. I'm sure to an extent you're limited in talking, but can you talk just generally about what the acquisition pipeline looks like currently in the Permian, and what you think your acquisition capacity could be from a financial standpoint? Travis Stice : Well, John, that's a good question, and you know my track record is we typically don't talk about any acquisitions that are currently ongoing. But I can tell you with regard to the pipeline, we still continue to see good opportunities out there. I'll tell you that the spread between bid and ask is probably still pretty wide as evidenced by not a lot of transactions occurring lately. But I also think it's reasonable from my stockholders to expect our fingerprints are on every transaction that occurs out here in the Permian. Because as I've said before. You are either in that M&A game or you're out of it. And Diamondback is active both doing the small bolt-on deals that we announced this quarter, as well as the larger deals. In terms of capacity, we don't typically screen our deals by on how big they could be. We look at the quality of the rock. And we believe that if we identify high quality rock, that our investors will appreciate our execution prowess and our financial performance in converting that rock into cash flow. And we really don't filter the deals on how big or how large they could be. John Nelson : That's helpful. Then I wanted to switch over to slide 5. I was hoping you could speak to how rig allocation on slide 5 is the scenario analysis for different commodity prices? I was hoping you could speak to how rig allocation between your different operating areas might look in different scenarios? Travis Stice : Yeah. We've consistently said the Spanish Trail has some of the best economics of any shale development in the Lower 48, especially when you consider the impact of the mineral ownership that the Viper has and Diamondback owning 88% of Viper. So we'll always try to keep two rigs at any commodity price in Spanish Trail. And then as you look towards entering 2016 with four rigs, we'll have the two rigs in Spanish Trail and we'll have two rigs both, one rig in Howard, one rig in Glasscock County, and then we'll bounce between those two new development areas into some drilling in Northwest Martin County or Northeast Andrews County. John Nelson : So would a fifth rig be added then back to - which area as we kind of stepped up that chain? Travis Stice : Yeah. You start moving up, we've got acreage position in Howard that could very easily support two rigs. We've got an acreage position in Glasscock County that could easily support two rigs. We'd keep the two in Midland County and we'd probably have one or two rigs in Northwest Martin County or Northeast Andrews County. John Nelson : Okay. That was very helpful. Thanks again, and congratulations on the quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks, John. And guess just to close that thought out, and as you get to higher oil prices, $65 to $75, we'd probably allocate a rig back down in Upton County. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Kistler of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. David Kistler : Good morning, guys. A quick follow-up on the acquisition comment. Can you talk a little bit about where you acquired acreage? And does any of that overlap into Viper and add some additional inventory to that portfolio? Travis Stice : Yes. Dave, I think we talked about $22 million worth of acquisitions. Those are all bolt-ons in and around mostly Midland County acreage. And yes, there's a portion of that acreage that Viper has the - owns the minerals. So it was accretive on both fronts, both Viper and Diamondback. It really underscores our continued efforts to build our high quality inventory, where we're doing these small bolt-on deals. And as I was talking to John just previously, we're still looking at the bigger deals as well. I believe that we've got the capacity to identify the rock and execute on the rock on just about any deal size but the blocking and tackling that's required to do these bolt-on deals is kind of a day in and day out activity. David Kistler : I appreciate that. Then also kind of thinking about slide five, but more so trying to tie it to capital program, if we kind of look at this year and back into the numbers, it feels like about $100 million of CapEx in aggregate equals kind of one rig. Is that the right way to think about the CapEx that might be allocated to each one of those scenarios based on how you've outlined the rigs? Travis Stice : Yeah, Dave. That's a good rule of thumb. Just to clarify that, that would also include drill complete, equip and any associated facilities and infrastructure that we'd have to do. So somewhere in that $100 million range per rig. David Kistler : Absolutely. And then just to understand the scenario analysis, when you look at those, you've highlighted in your portfolio before that returns are 40% to 70% at $40 oil in obviously Spanish Trail and whatnot. Is that the metric you need as you ratchet up in each one of these? Or is this really PV10 analysis? Travis Stice : It's more of a PV10 analysis, Dave, just to give our investors a full-scale look at the inventories that we have in our control. David Kistler : Okay. I appreciate that. Then one last one just as you think about the capital budget for this next year, are there specific metrics that you're focused on in terms of maybe a debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio that you'd want to stay within if you're going to outspend cash flow a little bit? Or is the mandate largely live within cash flow with the exception of maybe acquisitions, et cetera? Travis Stice : Good question, Dave. It's actually about four of those things you just laid out there. We consider in our capital allocation process, we consider leverage ratio, and we strive to stay below two times debt to EBITDA. We also look at our borrowing base, and as Tracy outlined, we conservatively took only $500 million out of the $750 million borrowing base. We try to maintain typically below 50% draw on a net revolver base. We look at cash outflow spend. We try to minimize that. Certainly the lower and lower the commodity price goes. And so we try to mix all those together along with lease obligations and drilling obligations and come up with an allocation process. So it's not just a single metric we look at. It's really a combination of all of them, but all of those that I just mentioned. And with our stated objective of rated returns back to our shareholders, we try to allocate capital accordingly. David Kistler : I appreciate that. One last one, if I can just sneak it in. Just looking at the growth you've delivered year to date, if you tapered down to a two or three-rig program, would that be considered kind of maintenance CapEx and maybe put you towards a flat production? Or would that be maybe a slight uptick? Travis Stice : I think when you go down to two to three rigs, again, we've not laid out in detail what our drilling plan is going to look like for 2016, but if you were at two to three rigs, you ought to expect more of a flattish production profile for next year. David Kistler : Perfect. Well, I really appreciate all the added color. Thanks for letting me sneak in so many questions. Take care. Travis Stice : You bet, Dave. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Lear of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Mark Lear : Good morning, guys. On the first results in the A and the Middle Spraberry, just wanted to get a sense of how you would now rank the target opportunities across your key focus area by zone? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, Mark. The Wolfcamp A results we thought turned out really well based on our results and those of other operators. The Wolfcamp A is certainly looking pretty good, not quite the quality of the Lower Spraberry, but seems to be outperforming the Wolfcamp B in this area. Of course we've always talked about how good we think the Wolfcamp A is in Howard County. So I think as you look at our focus looking at going out in 2016, obviously the Lower Spraberry will still be the main focus, but I think you'll see more Wolfcamp A wells come into the mix. On the Middle Spraberry, as we've mentioned before, the Middle Spraberry test we did is on the western side of Spanish Trail. We think that in general the performance improves as you move to the east, and I think you see that in the results of some other operators as well. So kind of on the Eastern side of Midland County I think you'll see a few more Middle Spraberry wells come into the mix as we continue to test that zone on some of the other acres. Mark Lear : And you alluded to the Lower Spraberry still being a focus in 2016. If you had to ballpark it, how would you be allocating capital by those different targets? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, but I think we're probably still looking at something on the order of 60% of Lower Spraberry wells. I think in a real low price environment that number could move up if oil prices improve. I think you'd see us continue to delineate some of the other zones and maybe that percentage of Lower Spraberry wells would move down a little. Mark Lear : Gotcha. And just changing too in a little bit, just recalling some of the conversation on the 2Q call about some of the Lower Spraberry spacing tests you had in the works, some impressive early time production results there. I was just curious how the performance there has progressed, and maybe some of the other tests you're currently working on? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I think it's probably still a little early. We had reported some results off of two and three well pads spaced at 500 feet. We just recently completed five wells, essentially developed half a section at 5000-foot spacing. The last of those wells have just recently come on line. So it's still a little early to gauge the true results there. Some of the earlier wells were watered out. They've come back nicely, so I think with the data we've got so far, we're comfortable in saying that on average we're meeting or maybe slightly exceeding that Ryder Scott type curve. We do have some - an additional kind of four-well test coming up. The last of those wells will be completed probably in the first quarter of 2016. So it'll be into 1Q or 2Q before we have some results there on 500-foot spacing. We were kind of doing some 660-foot spacing tests in northwest Martin that again - probably looking at 2Q before we have some meaningful results there. Mark Lear : Gotcha. Thanks, Russell. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann of Suntrust. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Morning, guys. Travis Stice : Hey, Neal. Neal Dingmann : [indiscernible] or Russ, one of the guys, obviously just when you think you can't squeeze out any more costs, I mean it's pretty impressive that 5.5 to 5.8 along with the nine days. Your thoughts on are you still going to be able to put some pressure on the Service companies out there. And then secondly, just on these efficiencies, can you really get anything down, nine days seems incredible. Can you get anything under that? Travis Stice : Well, first of all, from the Service costs, the Service sector has responded in a pretty fulsome way in 2015 with cost concessions. I still maintain that as long as there's idle equipment in the yard, there is pressure from the Service sector guys to put that arm to work, which means they have to come down on costs. I can tell you probably for just planning purposes, it feels like this is sort of the bottom. When they move marginally down, if commodity prices continue to soften or really to stay where they're at right now. But I think just for planning purposes, it sort of feels like the bottom. In terms of the efficiency gains, I'm really proud of the organization that they continue to do more, almost on a quarter basis. And I know we've got a culture that says we're going to do better on the next well, than we did on a prior well. And my expectations until we can drill complete and deplete one of these wells all in a single day, we're going to continue to push that efficiency envelope until we can achieve that. So I do think that we've made some great strides this year we making permanent some of these cost savings through the efficiency gains we've made. But we are always going to try to continue to push that envelope. Neal Dingmann : You said about the service to anybody. Either the rigs side or frac side, would anybody let you lock into longer term deals around these levels? Travis Stice : We've had conversations that way. I still believe that even if I locked in today, I'm going to be locking in higher costs than what we are going to see for a longer period of time. So I believe that we are getting extremely good service at extremely competitive pricing right now. And for Diamondback I believe we're just going to play the low cost guys, going to deliver good service right now for the near future. Neal Dingmann : Got it. And then just lately, I know with what you have with Viper and stuff, it just makes sense with your minerals to drill in the core area, and I know how set you are in Howard. What about your southern acreage? Any thoughts of doing some things down there any time you know down in Upton any time soon? Travis Stice : Yeah. I think I was kind of addressing that a little earlier in one of the questions and I said, because I kind of forgot about Upton County. Upton County's going to need probably $65 or $70 oil before we'd allocate capital down there. You know, that was our original development area. And we're proud that we started that whole horizontal renaissance down there. So we have an emotional tie to it, but the economics don't support developing down there until commodity prices improve, probably somewhere in that $65, $70 range. Neal Dingmann : Makes sense. All right. Great quarter, Travis. Travis Stice : Thank you, Neal. Operator : Thank you. And our next comes from the line of Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Michael Kelly : Thanks. Travis, I like the scenario analysis on slide five. And it looks like you've kind of already unhid a couple columns here on the CapEx and capital allocation front. I was hoping you could maybe unhide the growth column here. And then just curious on what the growth, what the associated growth is which each one of these scenarios. You already kind of hinted you're flattish in two to three rigs. Maybe you could talk about the 45 to 55 or the 55 to 65. Thanks. Travis Stice : You bet, Mike. And I appreciate the effort trying to get me to disclose 2016 there, but we're not ready to talk about growth ranges yet for 2016. I mean, we've still got some decisions we have to make on which well types we're going to drill, whether we drill on stacked laterals or we drill all one zone. And we've got to see what the commodity price is going to do as we exit the year. So I promise you when it's time to talk about 2016, I'll, as you pointed out, I'll unhide the columns. And we'll give you all the details that you need to put your model together. But still premature right now. Michael Kelly : Sure. Fair enough. Maybe we could just talk about the production trajectory going into Q4. I think if I take your updated full year guidance, it looks like price has sequential decline going into next quarter. And just wanted to get some color on some of the variables in Q4, whether you're implying that you're going to build DUCs or you've got some pad drilling. Just a few things that could be going on there, and I wanted to get some color. Travis Stice : Sure, Mike. Well, yeah, you're right in the fact that we'll probably with one completion crew and four drilling rigs, we're going to be building DUCs at a moderate pace, probably somewhere between 10 to 15 by the middle of next year. And we'll build a couple as we exit this year as well. There's a couple of other macro events that go on. The first, if you just do the math and if you take the upper end of our production range guidance, you're going to see that relative to where we are right now, it's close to flat quarter-over-quarter expectations. We don't know exactly if it's going to play out that way because there's also some things that typically incur in the fourth quarter that we were trying to take into account. One specifically is that we never can count on weather, but we know there's usually a weather event somewhere in December, and that can impact production relatively significantly. Two is the fact that we're drilling most of our wells on multi-well pads right now, and to the extent that one of those pads slides into or out of the quarter, it could have a production volume impact. And three, we also have seen historically that the service sector tries to get a few days in on vacation with Thanksgiving and Christmas. So our utilization rates during the fourth quarter typically drop a little bit. So we try to take all that into account. And again, we've never guided towards the quarter's production volumes because of some of those things that we just outlined. I know we've only got eight weeks or so left in the year, but those are the things we're considering. Michael Kelly : That's real helpful. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gordon Douthat of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. My question, and we talked about this a little bit last night, but my question has to do with the development configuration as you contemplate your 2016 program, specifically regarding the stacked well development configuration. I guess my question is do you notice any differences on the productivity side of the equation by doing a pad on the stacked well configuration across the various benches versus just focusing in one bench? So first on the productivity side. Then secondly, on the efficiency side, do you realize any efficiencies from drilling in that configuration as opposed to drilling within one bench across a single pad? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I'll answer the second question first. There's really no efficiency difference whether you drill three stacked laterals or three laterals in the same zone. The efficiency is basically the same. On the productivity side, as you know, we've always indicated that we thought on the eastern side of the basin it may be more important to drill stacked laterals because of the relative absence of frac barriers between the intervals. So our plans have always been to start out going stacked laterals on the east side of the Basin, Howard and Glasscock Counties, and as you see from our press releases, we've tested some stacked laterals on the west side of the Basin, and we've got a four-well stack we've drilled in that southwest Martin County acreage. And we're actually going to frac two of the intervals, first the Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry and then come back about a month later and frac the Wolfcamp A and Middle Spraberry. And we'll tag those fracs and monitor the results to try to get a better gauge of how much communication we're seeing vertically between those zones. And so based on tests like those, hopefully we'll make the best decision going forward. But if you ask us right now, we probably still lean towards for the most part drilling same zone on the western side of the basin and stacked laterals on the east side. Gordon Douthat : All right. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Grampp of Northland Securities. Your line is now open. Jeff Grampp : Good morning, guys. I wanted to kind of get your thoughts on some recent activity we've seen in the industry with your neighbors at Spanish Trail getting some good 500-foot Lower Spraberry results in the same landing zone. I'm just kind of wondering how you guys are viewing perceptivity of a concept like that, and then just kind of generally, your interest in any sort of operate test of a similar concept? Russell Pantermuehl : Well, as you know, we just talked about the - we drilled those five wells across it at 500-foot spacing in Spanish Trail, and as I mentioned, the results there are very early. We did land those essentially all at the same landing point, and so we'll continue to monitor those results. And we may do some tests as well where we stagger the landing zone within the Lower Spraberry. And we've had several other tests as well where we've done a two-well pad or a three-well pad at 500-foot spacing. And I think we show kind of the general results of those - I think it's one of the slides in the appendix. Actually, I think it's slide 18 where we show the average result of all the wells drilled at 500-foot spacing versus the ones drilled at 600-foot - 60-foot spacing versus what we called singular wells, which are wells that don't have an offset well within, say within 1,300 feet. And if you look at that, you don't see really any material difference between the ones that are at 500 feet versus 660 feet. But as we've always said, we don't consider those ones that - where we just did a two- or three-well pad or crude test, and that's why we'll be monitoring the results of these five wells at 500-foot spacing very closely. And we've got another four-well scenario at 500-foot spacing that we'll be doing at Spanish Trail as well. Jeff Grampp : Okay. And Russell, just to clarify, all of these 500-foot spaced tests that you guys are talking about and the results and the tests you guys have planned, those are all on a non-chevron pattern essentially and more just kind of on the same linear plane? Is that the right way to think about it? Russell Pantermuehl : Yes, that's correct. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Perfect. I appreciate it. And then just wondering on the increased profit and test that you guys have done in the past. I don't think anyone's really haven't heard anything on an update on that for a long time. Are you guys still seeing that similar trajectory in terms of production performance? Or just kind of wondering how the performance on those tests have been tracking lately? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. You know we did those I think three Wolfcamp B wells that we've increased our total stim size by roughly 40% to 50%. Those continue to track what we've indicated before, where we were seeing on average roughly 10% to 15% improvement in productivity. For a similar increase it can cost. Now the thing that we saw there was that there was a lot of variation in the wells. Some of them were performing roughly in line and then we had one that was probably 50% better than anything else we have seen. So we haven't done any follow-up test in the Wolfcamp B primarily because we've shifted our focus to the Lower Spraberry. We just bought on line, I think actually last night or sometime yesterday, a three well Lower Spraberry pad with the increased profit concentration. So we'll monitor those results and hopefully have some color on that next quarter. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Appreciate the time and the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason A. Wangler with Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Hey. Good morning, guys. Was just curious, the third quarter looked like obviously a lot of wells completed. And as you mentioned, the fourth quarter we are going to have a little bit of a holiday. What do you think the steady stage kind of completions would be on a quarterly basis if you could kind of continue that four rig and one completion crew activity level as we look to 2016? Travis Stice : Yeah. I think the fourth quarter probably around 14, 15 completions, something like that. The completion lever is one of the things that we can crack on to control that outspend in 2016 as well. But I think that cadence would be roughly in line for the fourth quarter anyway, 14, 15. Jason Wangler : Okay. And just obviously we are almost done with 2015 and haven't put anything on the way of hedges, don't really necessarily need to a year. But, is there any thought of looking at that just to kind of lock in some of the prices to even the Lower two or three rig problem? Or are you just going to kind of let these prices go until we see something better? Travis Stice : Yeah, Jason, we looked this morning for hedges, and I think hedges were still running for 2016 cal just straight swaps somewhere a little less than $52 a barrel, and if you look at the decisions we've made historically, we've positioned the company to not need a lot of hedges. We've got liquidity option in our ownership in Viper Energy Partners, and we've got essentially an undrawn and an unfully tapped borrowing base. So we believe in oil price recovery. We don't believe that our finances have to have hedges, and at $52 a barrel I don't want to lock out my investors from the upside in oil price. So we looked at it just about every day, but right now the risk versus reward we just feel, say, remains unhedged for 2016. Jason Wangler : Definitely understand. Appreciate the time. Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann of Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open. Jeb Bachmann : Morning, everyone. Travis, just a couple quick ones. Going back to earlier this year, you talked about being able to be essentially cash flow neutral to slightly positive in a 50 world in a four rig, and I think you guys have certainly exceeded that, and I was just wondering if that oil price has changed going into 2016 or you guys still think about it in that same situation? Travis Stice : Yeah. Again Jeb, we've not laid out much details for what 2016 is going to look like. We've had a varied rig count this year. We've been up to five and we'll have some carrying expenses in 2016 that will be attributed to a high rig activity. So kind of the things we crank on is completion cadence, well costs, commodity price, and we look at the varying cash outflows or cash out-spins if needed, what gets generated out of that model. If needed, if we get into a real four-star scenario in commodity prices, it could go all the way down to one or two horizontal rigs and maintain all of our lease obligations and be cash flow positive in a couple quarters once we burn off carrying costs from the prior year. So we've got it I think bracketed pretty well, Jeb, and I think in all those scenarios we've got our foot hovering over the accelerator and if we need to mash on the gas when the commodity price improves, which we believe it will, we'll be poised to do so. Jeb Bachmann : Great. And one more, just kind of on the technology front. Just wondering if you guys are employing the CnF technology from FloTek that some of your competitors are on the completion side? Travis Stice : No. Jeb Bachmann : Okay. Great. Appreciate it, guys. Travis Stice : Yeah. Jeb, it's just something we're watching. And one good thing about what goes on in the Permian, especially if there's success from the service companies that provide a service, we'll know about it really quickly. So we're not using it, but we're monitoring it. Jeb Bachmann : All right. Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. And our next comes from Sam Burwell of Canacord Genuity. Your line is now open. Sam Burwell : Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered thus far. But I wanted to throw one in on lateral lengths. I mean it seems like the vast majority of your wells are 7,500 feet, but any plans to drill some 10,000 footers going forward? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. If you look at our average well for this year, it'll be right around 7,000 feet. You'll see that number go up next year. A lot of our Howard County acreage and Glasscock County acreage is laid out nicely to drill 10,000 foot laterals. I don't know the number off the top of my head on how many 10,000 foot laterals we drilled this year, but we drilled quite a few. And operationally, everything seems to be working fine. So we're migrating to longer laterals where we can, depending on how our acreage is laid out. Sam Burwell : What percentage of your acreage would you say is amenable to 10,000 foot laterals, rough numbers? Russell Pantermuehl : I would say probably 30% to 40%. Our Southwest Martin County acreage, the way it's laid out, it makes sense to do 7,500 foot laterals. And then some of our Northwest Martin, those are laid out in [indiscernible] versus sections, so a lot of those are 8,000 feet. Northeast Andrews County is kind of a mix between 7,500 and 10,000. And the same thing on the east side of the basin. But as we're laying out drilling units, we're trying to lay them out with 10,000 laterals wherever we can, and trying to swap acreage with other operators to make that happen. Sam Burwell : Okay. Sounds good. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Oatman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Brandon for Ryan. A quick, if we could go back to the Middle Spraberry real quick. How much of that acreage has had significant prior vertical development such that you would have concerns about horizontal Middle Spraberry productivity? Russell Pantermuehl : If you look at the majority of our Midland County and Southwest Martin County, those have had a lot of vertical well development. But the same thing affected the Lower Spraberry as well. And so we haven't seen a big difference in horizontal well productivity in the areas where we had vertical development versus where we didn't. So we don't think it's a big effect. We just don't think those vertical wells affectively depleted the shale intervals where we're replacing the horizontal laterals. So I think there is some effect there, but it's not a big effect. If you look at where the Middle Spraberry reported results have been, in Martin and Midland, those are areas that had vertical well development. So we think the results are already reflecting that. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Great. That is really helpful. Then one more here. You guys have always been focused on high margins, even in the days of $90 oil. Have you guys discussed the need for cost reflect - commodity price with these new wells approaching 5.5 million in oil at 50? Can you help us understand how efficiently you and your partners have gotten in this area? And how do returns look from a historical context? Are they similar with where you were at $70 and $90 oil? Travis Stice : Yeah. Just looking at Russell here. Probably we're about the same as at $70. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. It was probably about the same as $70 to $80. Even though the costs have come down considerably in that 25% to 35% range as we indicated, but oil is down almost 50%. So you're not seeing the same returns that you did at $90 or $100 oil, but as we indicated in that table, even at $50 oil, we've got a lot of inventory that has pretty nice returns. If you gave us a choice, we'd take the $90 oil back at the higher costs. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. That's it from me. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jeff Robertson of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Robertson : Thanks. Russell, a question on the Wolfcamp A, as you layer that in where you've already had Wolfcamp B wells and maybe even Lower Spraberry wells, will you complete those wells differently than where you may not have those other two zones above and below that have been developed? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I think the one thing we would certainly do is just try to stagger that Wolfcamp A lateral between wherever it would be or Lower Spraberry laterals are. We're not certain that will make a difference, but I think it gives us the best opportunity. And one thing is as we've been testing different things on the completion side in addition to more profit-loading. We're also testing tighter cluster spacing and I think that's probably something that we consider as well just to try to get as much stimulation near the lateral as we can. We don't want to necessarily try to get a lot of frac height growth. You don't have a whole lot of options on limiting that, but we'd also do everything we could on that side to keep the frac within that Wolfcamp A interval. Jeffrey Robertson : So that will minimize the chance that you get interference with existing wells? Russell Pantermuehl : Yes. Jeffrey Robertson : And a question, Tracy, on the DD&A rates, you talked about the impairment effect on lower DD&A. Are you all seeing any significant impact on DD&A from the increased tight curves that you've talked about this year? Teresa Dick : We get more reserves, would you say? Sorry. I was referring - looking over here at Russell. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I mean there is going to be some effect because we are going to be booking quite a bit more Lower Spraberry PUDs than we had before. If you remember last year, we had a pretty low number of Spraberry PUDs just because we hadn't drilled that many Lower Spraberry wells. So as we look at this year and you look at how many Lower Spraberry wells we completed, we'll have quite a few more PUDs in the Lower Spraberry, so that will affect the DD&A rate... Teresa Dick : Which will help. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. Which will help... Teresa Dick : Help the impairment, but what's - what the impair - the impairment is being caused by just that rolling average price that keeps kicking down and down as three months roll off. So the offset of more reserves will help reducing impairment, although we are kind of in a cycle of having to record the impairment here until the prices start to flatten out on the SEC rolling. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I mean with the drop in oil prices since last year, that SEC rolling first of month price is still going down. It was almost $72 a barrel at the end of 2Q. At the end of 3Q, it was $59 a barrel, so over about a $12 per barrel drop. And if you look at our projection for what it's going to be at the end of this year, the SEC price will probably be slightly below $51 a barrel, so it's continued to trend down and that's the biggest driver of the impairment. We've been increasing reserves, but our PV10 values have gone down due to pricing. Jeffrey Robertson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lane French of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Lane French : Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some color on Viper's NGL realizations. It appears that the spread between average might double as your prices compared to your realized NGL prices seem too wide by about $3 per barrel or so over the quarter. I was wondering if there is a specific reason for that, and how to expect that to proceed going forward? Teresa Dick : Hi. This is Tracy. So our NGLs actually the pricing is more of an effect of a prior period adjustment on the volumes. We actually had recorded some positive volume PPAs into this quarter due to an under-accrual in Q2. So that's really affecting the price that you're seeing. If you average the three quarters, you're really going to get a true price. Now again, it's very immaterial to our revenues and this PPA is very small and immaterial in the overall scheme of things. That's really where that pricing got a little out of whack there. Lane French : Thank you. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. Just one other comment on that. So we're probably averaging maybe $13 a barrel right now for NGL. One thing that really affects that average NGL price is the amount of Ethane recovery. And the plant that most of Vipers lines were going to was not doing a lot of Ethane rejection, which they have recently started. So there may be a tick-up in the average price, although the NGL volumes will go down as well. So it might be a little better than $13. And you know, typically NGL prices improve in the winter months as well, particularly from a propane side. So I'd expect a tick-up in the next couple of quarters, and hopefully, we're at the beginning of a longer-term recovery in NGL prices. Lane French : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks to everyone, again, for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. How a great day, everyone.",

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint fourth quarter 2015 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated presentation which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements related to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis? Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you for listening to Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners' fourth quarter 2015 conference call. To begin, I want to discuss how Diamondback views the current environment and how we are responding before I turn the comments over to Mike and Tracy to highlight operational and financial details. 2016 began with oil prices testing recent lows. Diamondback Energy is well-positioned in this environment and continues to demonstrate that we are a low-cost operator with superior execution abilities. After our equity raise last month, Diamondback had over $250 million in cash at the end of January 2016 and an undrawn revolver. Our all-in cash costs including G&A, LOE, transportation and production taxes are currently below $10 of BOE. To further illustrate our cost structure, Diamondback has 140 employees producing almost 38,000 BOEs a day. We've always run a lean organization, and times like now remind us how that's a prudent practice to follow. We continue to emphasize our strategy of capital discipline, especially in light of current low oil prices and their impact on stockholder returns. We've consistently communicated that we accelerate development when returns to our stockholders are increasing and decelerate when returns weaken. We have widened our 2016 production and capital guidance ranges to allow for capital flexibility in our operations as rig count and completions cadence may fluctuate through the year. If you look at slide 5, we've outlined our actions on how we responded to a low price environment. We've reduced D&C costs and deferred drilling and completion activity while maintaining our leasehold position. This allows Diamondback to preserve capital flexibility, maintain our conservative balance sheet and keep leverage low. Also on slide 5, in a lower for longer $35 per barrel WTI price scenario, Diamondback believes it can maintain conservative net debt to EBITDA under 2 times through the end of the decade without accessing the capital market or drawing on our revolver. On slide 6, we provided a more detailed scenario analysis highlighting the number of locations economic at different WTI prices and added a lower price tranche of $25 to $35 WTI. At the midpoint of this range, Diamondback has almost 500 economic locations, and we have over 1500 economic locations at $40 WTI. We've been able to increase the number of gross locations at each oil price since the last presentation because leading-edge D&C costs are currently at $5.25 million per 7500-foot lateral, down from $6 million used previously. Turning briefly to M&A strategies, Diamondback Energy believes the current environment will present opportunities to grow our Company. We believe our execution ability and low cost structure make us a natural consolidator within the basin. However, we will only do deals that are accretive to our stockholders. Viper Energy Partners continues to look for accretive mineral opportunities inside and outside the Midland Basin. We also recognize the opportunity for Viper to provide liquidity to distressed sellers through the purchase of their royalty interest. As I stated previously, Diamondback has an undrawn revolver and over $250 million in cash. Diamondback will continue to run its business in a prudently conservative manner until we believe that oil prices have recovered, sufficient to allow us to return to a growth mode. We had hoped that oil price bottom was going to be at the end of 2015, but now we are hopeful that it will happen later this year. However, if our expectations are wrong, Diamondback can weather the storm. In a prolonged period of low oil prices, Diamondback expects to be the last man standing. I will now turn the comments over to Mike. Mike Hollis : Thank you, Travis. As mentioned in last night's press release, we have now completed our first three-well pad in Glasscock County targeting the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. These wells had an average lateral length of approximately 7400 feet and produced a seven-day average of over 3600 BOE per day on a combined basis. At the end of 2015, we also drilled a two-well pad in Glasscock County targeting the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B that's currently flowing back. Slide 8 shows Diamondback's Glasscock County activity as well as notable offset results. We've also delineated our IP data on this slide. In Howard County, we have drilled a three-well pad that targets the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, and we are currently drilling a second three-well pad. We intend to complete these wells in mid-2016. One of these wells was a 9600-foot lateral that was drilled in less than12 days from spud to total depth, which we believe to be fastest well to TD in the area. A map of Diamondback's Howard County acreage and notable offset results is located on slide 9. Slide 10 shows that in all of our core operating areas, Diamondback continues to drill wells faster than offsetting peers. We drilled a three-well pad in Spanish Trail in 37 days from spud of the first well to rig release of the third well. In Martin County, we drilled a well with a 7500-foot lateral in less than 10 days from spud to TD. In addition to our continued efforts to drill wells faster, we've also managed to lower other drilling expenses. To that point, we were able to move a rig roughly 90 miles from Spanish Trail to Howard County in less than three days from rig release to spud of the next well. Slide 11 shows our current realized well cost reductions, which have come down roughly 30% to 35% since the peak in 2014. Leading-edge drill complete and equip costs are trending between $5 million and $5.5 million for a 7500-foot well and between $6.5 million and $7 million for a 10,000-foot lateral well. Slide 12 shows reductions to our current realized lease operating expenses since the peak of 2014. We are extremely proud of our production organization for the lowering LOE per BOE from nearly $8 a barrel in 2014 to less than $7 a barrel in 2015. By gathering the data to fix the wells right the first time, we have reduced our rod and pump failure rates translating to lower LOE. We were able to integrate on 139 existing vertical high operating cost wells primarily in Howard County in the second half of 2015 while lowering the LOE. Slide 13 illustrates Diamondback's crude reserves, which increased 39% as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $157 million BOE. Additions replaced 465% of 2015 production with a drill bit F&D cost of $5.51 per BOE. Drillbit F&B declined by 50% from $11 per BOE in 2014 as we continue to decrease development cost and target the Lower Spraberry and new horizontal formations such as the Wolfcamp A and Middle Spraberry. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa Dick : Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $39 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Diamondback's consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $123 million, which is 11% above EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014 despite price realizations being significantly stronger in 2014. Our fourth quarter 2015 average realized price per BOE including the effect of hedges was $55. Diamondback continues to have peer-leading cash margins driven by our focus on execution and cost optimization. Slide 14 shows that our 2015 operating expenses are 29% lower than the peer average for the first three quarters of 2015. Also on that same slide, we show that Diamondback continues to be one of the leanest operators with G&A less than half that of the peer average for the same period. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our cash G&A costs were $1.06 per BOE while non-cash G&A costs were $1.40. During the fourth quarter of 2015, our capital spend for drilling, completing and equipping our wells was $70 million. Our infrastructure costs were $5 million, and we paid $20 million on our non-operated property. The Company spent an additional $24 million on primarily bolt-on acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2015. At the end of January 2016, we were undrawn on our secured revolving credit facility after paying down the balance with proceeds from our recent equity rate. With over $250 million in cash and $500 million in undrawn revolver capacity, we have ample liquidity to fund our 2016 drilling program. Pro forma for proceeds from the equity offering, our net debt to annualized fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA is 0.4 times as shown on slides 15 and 16. Moving to slide 17, we provide our guidance for 2016. As announced last night, we widened our 2016 production guidance to a range of 32,000 to 38,000 BOE per day including a range of 6000 to 6500 BOE per day attributable to Viper to account for the continued volatility and uncertainty in the commodity market. We expect our capital spend to range from $250 million to $375 million for 2016. Turning to operating cost per BOE, our 2016 LOE is guided to the range of $6 to $7 and gathering and transportation to a range of $0.50 to $1. Our cash G&A projection is $1 to $2, and our non-cash G&A is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $2.50. We have forecasted our DD&A rate from $13 to $15, and production and ad valorem taxes are expected to be 8% of revenue. I will now turn to Viper Energy Partners, which recently announced a distribution of $0.228 per unit for the fourth quarter, 14% above the third quarter cash distribution. This distribution represents an approximate 6% yield when annualized based on the February 12 closing price. Viper has no minimum quarterly distribution or complex ownership hierarchy. The majority of cash flow is return to unit holders through quarterly distribution, providing upside when oil prices rebound. On slide 18, we show how Viper's distribution remains resilient despite lower oil prices due to organic production growth. Spanish Trail remains one of the most economic areas in the Permian Basin, and we expect the operators will continue to drill there. At the end of 2015, Viper had $34.5 million drawn on its revolver. Now turning to Viper's guidance, we expect a production range of 6000 to 6500 BOE per day. On a per BOE basis, we anticipate cash G&A costs of $0.50 to $1.50 and non-cash G&A of $2 to $3 in 2016. We expected DD&A to range between $14 and $16 and gathering and transportation of $0.25 to $0.50 with production and ad valorem taxes at 8% of revenue. As a reminder, Viper does not incur LOE or capital expenditures. I will now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Tracy. In summary, Diamondback has taken the correct steps to respond to current low commodity prices. We're well-positioned to live in a $35 WTI world through the end of the decade and developed plans that reflect net debt to EBITDA less than 2 times without accessing capital markets or drawing on our revolver. We've laid out plans to respond to difficult commodity prices and are poised to return to growth mode when market conditions improve. Lastly we maintained our unwavering focus on execution, continuing to push our advantage in low-cost D&C operations in peer-leading expense structure and remain transparent with our business strategy. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : The press release made reference to opportunities for accretive growth given you guys are guiding to organic production flat at best I'm assuming that means you expect means be more active in the acquisition market. Can you comment on what you are seeing in the acquisition pipeline? Are these corporate transactions, asset deals, private equity players, public operators and to the point on accretive growth, is this really just your multiple premium that you think is a differentiator here or is Diamondbacks efficiency advantage also something you expect to add material value in acquisition? Travis Stice : John, there's a lot of questions embedded in there. Let me talk from a high level from Diamondbacks perspective. What I talked about in January when we did our equity raise is that we were seeing an increase in the amount of smaller bolt-on transactions are what we call around here little A type acquisitions and we're continuing to see those. I think the fact that you are not seeing a lot of announced trades on larger acreage blocks probably tell you that the spread between bid and ask is still relatively high and believe the sellers probably have a price forecast that's above of what the acquirers are looking for. And the bigger sequel of combinations we continue to evaluate different opportunities there again to do so only in an accretive fashion. Diamondback has a long history from the very beginning of being and acquire and exploit company, so we\u2019re increasing our efforts on the opposition fronts. We really just continuing what we've always done which is to look for accretive opportunities that we believe we can demonstrate that [indiscernible] Diamondbacks hands than in somebody's else through our conversion process of rocking the cash flow. How the other elements that you are describing are trying to move around in the acquisition space, probably best answer those guys, but Diamondback is committed to doing smart deals that are accretive and we believe that we are the right operator and if we find the right rock we will generate the right returns for it. John Nelson : Just moving to expenses on the quarter, aggregate LOE dropped despite the increase in volumes. It was pretty impressive. Your '16 guidance seems to imply you give most of that back though, was there anything one time that sort of aided 4Q results or is there may be some conservativism built into 2016 LOE guidance? Travis Stice : Yes, just on any guidance in 2016, we don't typically build in conservative guidance at all, we try to put our best estimates forward and communicate that in a transparent fashion. Now specifically to what happened in the fourth quarter, Mike mentioned some in his prepared remarks but when we acquired our properties in Northwest Howard County kind of midsummer of last year, in our accrual process for accounted for expenses we were using the prior operators run rate on expenses and because our operations organization has had the opportunity now a couple of times to assimilate large high-cost vertical wells into our inventory, they really responded in a very quick fashion to get these wells operating like Diamondback expects. As result we kind of overshot what we were thinking expenses were going to be up in the third quarter and the fourth quarter was the beneficiary of that overshooting. So I would really characterize it as giving back any of the expenses we tend to try to hold onto every penny we ever pick up but that\u2019s specifically what happened in the fourth quarter. We believe our guidance is $67 a barrel for 2016 is right down in the middle of the fairway. Operator : The next question is from Michael Glick of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Glick : Just on your flat $35 a barrel case could you give us some color on with the Company would look like a couple years out? Travis Stice : Well obviously Mike, we've got the company model that there not a big fan of giving multi-year forecast out there. I can tell you from a general perspective if Diamondback was to run one to two rigs, our production is flat to slightly declining, if we were to run two plus rigs it's going to be flat to a slight growth as you look out into the future. Obviously with a lot of capital flexibility this year predicting exactly what 2017 is going to look like is a little early to do on the 17th day of February. So we're going to try to model the company and give you updates of each quarterly update but I think in a general sense that one to two rigs flat to decline and two rigs more flat to up sort of forecast what the future is going to look like. To make that statement though we were at the lower end of our rig cage, kind of that 1, 2 rig cadence to get to that $35 comment that I made. Michael Glick : At the low-end of capital how should we think about the cadence of completions moving through the year and how many docks would you expect to have a year end? Travis Stice : At the low-end of the CapEx guide we probably end up with 30 to 40 DUCs by the end of this year. And if we were at the higher end of that guide we probably end up with 10 or less DUCs. Operator : The next question is from Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Say, Travis just add onto that last question. When you look at the plan for this but just the DUCs but how do you see as far as the areas of drilling more when you look at the Spanish Trail obviously you had success now on these new Glasscock, you mentioned obviously the very quick well you were able to drill up in Howard. How should we think about the entire plan under that kind of that lower for longer scenario or if you are were going to upsize things a bit? Travis Stice : Sure. I will put the endpoint on it Neal. If we were to run two to four rigs which would be towards the upper end of the guidance and of course as I stated in my commentary we would have to have some pretty good confidence in oil prices before we went to the upper end of the rig count but if we were running three to four rigs we keep the two rigs in Spanish Trail and we would have one rig in Glasscock, one rig in Howard and then if we moved the rig around we probably catch a well or two in Northeast Andrews County where we've had some really nice results. If you\u2019ve to lower end, I mean if we get all the way down to one rig like we talked about potentially in midsummer if commodity prices continue to soften from this point, that rig would be mostly the drilling obligations which would be heavily weighted towards Howard County where we've got three wells drilled and drilling our second three well pad now and probably bouncing the rig occasionally in and out of Spanish Trail as well. So that's the way it looks Neal with the one rig all the way up to four rigs. Neal Dingmann : And then just lastly, you all have unique benefit obviously went through and Tracy went through with Viper to have that and obviously to me I think the shares certainly with oil prices haven't rebound maybe where they once could here. Do you anticipate you mentioned with accretive acquisition I'm just wondering is there a way to use Viper at all or will you just sort of continue -- if this environment continues you will just continue how you've been with the higher interest with it or is there anything else you can do with those? Travis Stice : Well of course without getting into any deal specifics we recognize that Diamondback is uniquely advantaged with those Viper units and that does represent something that we can do in a trade that nobody else can do ago whether it is a co-bid strategy, Viper bidding alongside Diamondback or even Diamondback using the Viper as a form of liquidity in a transaction. We\u2019re seeing increased interest in Viper units at these low commodity prices as people involve themselves that commodity prices by be bottoming out and beginning to recover. I guess I can't give you any deal specifics Neal but I do think that there's a likelihood that some kind of transaction that Diamondback is involved in the future would include Viper ownership. Operator : The next question is from Mike Kelly of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Mike Kelly : Travis, you detailed out what we could expect on the deferred completions front really for 2016 and a couple of different scenarios, but I'm just curious what do you are doing right now, what the strategy is? Are you really completing wells? What are you doing with oil around $30? Thanks. Travis Stice : With oil below $30 a barrel as I laid out in one of those slides, I think slides 5 or 6, you know we\u2019re actually deferring some completions right now. So we will likely continue to defer completions through the end-of-the-year and in order to get to that 30 to 40 total DUCs we're going to be probably deferring 4 to 5 DUCs a quarter to get to that number. So that's kind of how we\u2019re looking at a right now, Mike. The one thing about DUCs is that once we\u2019re convinced that commodity price has recovered we believe that we can go out really quickly and prosecute an execution plan that gets these DUCs completed inside the current year. Again we're going to be very judicious in that decision process though. Operator : The next question is from Gordon Douthat of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gordon Douthat : Just kind of more lessons on the table on slide 6. Just trying to get a sense on how you toggle activity levels first with the completion of the ducts and then beyond that the potential to add additional rigs as we move through these different pricing scenarios, should we assume that the rig count or increases as you move through up through these levels or how should we interpret that slide? Travis Stice : We tried to laid out as clearly as we could Gordon on rig counts, as oil price moves up with some confidence that it is going to remain there, we will pick those additional rigs up. I think the most likely scenario is the first lever we pull on under recovered oil prices is working on those DUCs and then the second lever would be stand up an additional rig. So in a general sense we've always talked about sort of whatever the first number on oil prices is about the number of rigs are going to run. I think that's still holds in slide 6. Gordon Douthat : And then regarding comment on opportunities for accretive growth. When you look at acquisition opportunities does this necessarily involve for it to be accretive the use of Viper in one form or another joint bid or use of Viper as a source of liquidity or are you looking at standalone Diamondback bids or how do you weigh that as you look at these deals? Travis Stice : Gordon, again without giving a lot of commentary on what our exact acquisition bid strategy is, all of those things you just laid out are available to Diamondback as we try to do an accretive deal. I think it's deal specific and we will look at all of the combinations that you just laid out in order to create the greatest accretion to our shareholders. Operator : The next question is from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. Michael Hall : I guess just one more on the M&A angle or ANDA angle. I'm just curious we often look at the public equities and try to back into an implied commodity price and see something today that is a decent premium to the current strip. I was wondering if we can take that analogy and you could help us try to apply that in the private market and you talk about the bid ask spread being wide. What sort of price levels are maybe being applied as you look at these deals, what sort of price levels are being implied by the sellers sufficient to win a bid at this point? Travis Stice : I appreciate the interest behind that question. Again I'm not going to talk a lot about how Diamondback views these things but I tell you Michael in a general sense what I believe is that the sellers always hold on to the last trade that was publicly announced. So if you have not seen any transactions occur on the acreage size, it is probably because most of the sellers are hanging on to it the last amounts trade was and I believe you can do your own reconnaissance on that but somewhere north of $30,000 [indiscernible]. So I think we will have to wait and see Michael until you see some transactions come across the Board whether or not that gap is really closed. Michael Hall : Also I'm just trying to think through capital efficiencies in the low case scenarios not only for yourselves but across the industry. I guess how do we think about things like pad development and what might be the most efficient way in a vacuum to develop things as opposed to the realities of try to hold leasehold and things along those lines. Would you say that the low case -- the low end of the range that you provided is exhibiting those fixed cost flowing through and provides a range of capital efficiency in terms of how we think about moving forward, things will really have to ratchet it higher from a capital efficiency standpoint. Travis Stice : I'm going to answer the macro question and then specifically on the low-end I'm going to let Tracy answer on the low-end side of the capital efficiency. On a macro view the more rigs that you run typically the more efficient your operations are because you are keeping a rig there on location longer and getting a three well pad drilled and you\u2019re bring in a completions and it is a more efficient process when you can kind of keep a rig in the general area and let the drilling and completion cadence follow in an efficient manner. When you actually go to a world where you\u2019re only running one rig you\u2019re by definition given up some of those efficiencies because where you might want to keep a rig on their for two months to get three wells drilled you might actually have to only drill one well there, you may only have the time to drill one well there and move the rig to another location so you sort of give up some efficiencies there. That\u2019s in a macro sense, I'd rather be more efficient running more rigs but now I've got about some cash burn so specifically to your question on the low-end of our CapEx guide I think there's another element that Tracy is going to explain to you. Teresa Dick : On the low-end there we do have probably some efficiency loss there, but to clarify what's going on, we have the guidance out there of 30 completions but when we are running that low we\u2019re actually going to be drilling more wells than we complete so there's capital being burnt there and you are not really getting it in the well count when you are doing the division. As well as -- running lower amount of rigs we\u2019re going to have some rig penalties in there and then lastly there is a little bit of there is some wells that you start in 2015 that you end up paying for in 2016. So again when you are dividing them just by 30 wells versus let's say the upper end of 70 it shows a lower capital efficiency in the amount that's how are low-end is working. Michael Hall : Last one on my end is just around the Glasscock cut wells. Is completion designs on those wells vary between themselves then relative to how you complete wells further west or any changes around that? Travis Stice : Yes, Michael on the first three well pad that we talked about that Mike talked about, first just again I'm going to reemphasize how pleased we\u2019re with the early flow back data from those wells. I think they are at or above our expectations at each of the three intervals and we outlined that on the one slide that's in the deck. So what we did when we moved into that area we wanted to make sure that we try to get our best assessment relative to how we completed the wells in Midland County. So we actually followed the same recipe in Midland County on those Glasscock County wells and that gives us a better comparison. We didn\u2019t talk about the two well pads [indiscernible] that we've only been flowing back for about a week now. We actually increased the same concentration the completion density on those two well pads so as we get the three well pad that's flowing back right now we get information out of that that's done with our traditional Midland County completion we will be able to compare it right next with a two well pad with the increased sand that we put there. So we think we are doing it kind of the smart way in terms of trying to assess the size of that when we kick in the full-scale development we will have the best recipe but I would tell you again just to reemphasize the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B at or above expert [indiscernible] actually has been the most surprising zone in Glasscock County because it appears to be as good as the Wolfcamp B and A and certainly better than the wells the 15-mile radius around there. So really excited about the Lower Spraberry. Michael Hall : And that lower Spraberry well has it peaked yet or is it exhibiting a similar profile to those in Midland County? Travis Stice : Yes is probably -- we put that well on [indiscernible] 3.5 weeks ago so it is probably at its peak rate. Operator : The next question is from [indiscernible] of Simmons and Company. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : When we think about the 2150 to 23 and 75 million CapEx range come how should we think about the commodity prices assumptions that are embedded into that guidance? Is that $25 to $35 range? Travis Stice : I think the 25 to $35 range, that's the one to two rigs and that's going to put you up to lower end of that CapEx range. If you are in the 35 to $45 WTI range that's two to three rigs and that's going to push you towards the upper end of that CapEx range. We type that -- the production range that we did so are intellectually honest between breaks, CapEx -- and reduction guidance. Unidentified Analyst : When we look beyond 2016, do you see the Company eventually transitioning to two mount laterals -- lateral program. I know I know you guys are running 7500 on average but tobacco 210,000 beyond 2016? Travis Stice : And a general sense, we try to drill as long as we can help is geometry allows us so we have -- on the Board this year. We believe the capital efficiency is much better and we've demonstrated -- we always want to try to drill longer. That was one of the reasons we were so excited about how -- over half of those wells as we develop they are going to be of the 10,000 foot variety. On a looking into 2017 to drill longer. I'm looking into next month to do this was longer but it is somewhat limited by -- geometry. Unidentified Analyst : Just a last one for me in terms of service cost concessions from the service dies, do you still see some room there in 2016 or do you think we've got -- gotten all of it that we've gotten all we can get from those guys? Travis Stice : And certainly are business harder's on service side there under quite a bit of a stress right now and I know that as long as they have vital equipment in their guard their pressure is to get prices set so that equipment can go to work so I think there may be a little bit of movement still, but I totally for planning purposes and that's the way we are looking at it as well for planning purposes, I think the numbers that we gave you are good for the year. But [indiscernible] it gets it will be downward pressure but we believe the cost kind of in right now. Operator : The next question is from Jason Wangler of Wunderlich. Your line is open. Jason Wangler : Just dovetailing on one you mentioned the plans you have either one rig program or three, adjust with a copy the third rig you are looking to ask month, with two rigs with 1 B basically Spanish Trail and the other voting or just how you see that in the number two scenario? Travis Stice : I think we were try this but that out earlier as well but Jason with one rig that's going to be bouncing around the for the various lease obligations mostly and Howard County. If we are running two rigs one rig would be -- part one rig -- in Spanish Trail and then probably have 20 quarter of that trick will around even in Glasscock or Howard County. But you going to keep pretty much one rig and Howard County, most of the year and then any other rigs will be added to first Spanish Trail and then secondly to Glasscock County and Northeast Andrews County. Jason Wangler : And on that as you look at that holding the leases and Howard, is that a couple of years you would have to do that? Would you be Ray Merilee done but in of this year or where you see that falling in the lower scenario? Travis Stice : Yes, it is probably a fair statement for the next 12 to 24 months. Of course, we are doing things -- if we were in an -- oil price we have to look at these extensions and things like that that will allow us to avoid drilling right away but in a general sense at least for planning purposes probably this year and the next we will keep our rig up there and Howard County which if we hadn't been able to demonstrated to yet until we complete these wells but we think that will be good economic proposition as well. Then also really outstanding well test we had Glasscock County noise got the competitive returns down there as well to we've got some abilities to have big our capital more -- as we look at returns to our shareholders. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Grampp of Northland Securities. Your line is open. Jeff Grampp : I wanted to go back to the table you guys have regarding the economic locations of the various price tags and looking back to your past that's it looks like you about doubled your week even inventory in that were you should price tags so just wanted some color on that if that's exclusively related to the lower well cost assumptions that you guys have been able to Julie be or maybe there some increased confidence about well performance in some newer areas or some newer zones you guys are adding there? Travis Stice : Certainly we are more confident everyday we get well test actually Glasscock County and soon-to-be Howard County but specifically Jeff though, -- well cost from six really dollars per well for 7500-foot lateral, the last time you visit our last quarterly call -- makes a big difference in the number of locations that are economic. Jeff Grampp : And then, not looking at the backend of your deck year, the updated well performance from the Lower Spraberry [indiscernible]. Maybe if you can get a little bit more color about that -- that were you had some water watering out of issues a looks like, is that something that you guys had expected? Of these wells performing and mind just wondering how you guys are looking at these wells relative to the really staunch -- from some is going wider spaced wells? Unidentified Company Representative : I know we have got a lot of different curves on that slide [Technical Difficulty] we show one of the curves for the 500 wells without the five well pad and you can see putting much mimics the result of the wider spacing -- specifically to the five well pad we were a little surprised -- Operator came in and drilled some wells -- that watered out the tab really watered out several of our wells on our five well pad. Two of those wells are lead times eventually affecting the end of the curve. One of those wells -- as well that we drilled lighter and it was partially watered out as well so it affects the early time so it really affects the whole curve. I think the thing that to look at is if you look at the very end of the curve and you see the slope you can see that those wells over the last 20 or 30 days had started to recover on are recently back to the rates that we projected. I know you just look at it overall and it looks a little concerning but when you actually step back and look at the individual wells and how they were covered I would say the results looked pretty encouraging at this point -- on the wells that we're drilling now we are continuing to use the 500-foot spacing in Spanish Trail. Jeff Grampp : Then last one for me on the completion side see some other operators getting some encouraging results on some different completion optimization because -- about some increase -- in Glasscock just wondering how you guys are looking at progressing throughout the year different tester might have on the doc. or concepts you guys are looking at internally on the completion front? Travis Stice : Jeff, we spend a lot of time the only analyzing -- results but also analyzing what said publicly from other operators and we try to incorporate this practices and learnings from other operators quickly into our business so I think you are seeing things like increased sand, increase cluster spacing, tighter distances, all of those things are reasonable to expect Diamondback to have some commentary on by the end of the year. Certainly now when cost are as low as they are on pressure pumping now is a good time to be experiment and with that. There's a few things though that we're pretty confident we won't be trying and that is that -- we have always been even since 2012 we've always been a slick water shop and we intend to continue there on slick water fracs. Operator : The next question is from [indiscernible] of JMP Securities. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Just hoping back to the 2016 guidance range of 32,000 to 38,000 per day. Given it was a strong fourth quarter at about 37 and change. I know you don't give guidance on a quarterly basis but could you just directionally walk me through maybe in the low price scenario if you do end up going to one rig in a second quarter just how long it's progressed throughout the year? Travis Stice : There is a reason we don't give quarterly guidance because there's so much fluctuation when you can bring on like we did a Glasscock County you bring a three well pad that's doing almost 4000 barrels a day that can materially impact one quarter. So it's really difficult for me to try to tell you exactly -- I cannot tell you exactly what quarter over quarter production is going to do. Generally, Bob, if you've got one to two rigs running you\u2019re going to have flat to declining production. If you're running two or more rigs your production is [indiscernible] and that statement holds regardless of whether it is now or two years from now. That's how we view production changing. Unidentified Analyst : And then switching over to Howard County looking forward to getting the results in the middle of the year. Could you just contrast what the Midland acreage in terms of which intervals are most perspective and maybe talk to [indiscernible] how the geology changes as you head east of Howard? Unidentified Company Representative : Bob, based on other operators results in the area that looks like the Wolfcamp A is probably going to be the best zone in Howard County but we think the lowest Spraberry is probably a close second. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of Wolfcamp B results but generally the B thickens as you move to the West more basin work, so we think on our particular acreage in Howard and as it moves a little bit over into Martin County we think our B results there probably going to be better than what you see out of the industry because most of their wells are closer to the shelf or the B-- Operator : The next question is from Ben Wyatt of Stephens. Your line is open. Ben Wyatt : But has there been deep enough cut on the services side to where you are starting to see some degradation with crews and just would love you guys thought if that's going to be challenge when prices rebound and maybe if you even if you guys have a price of where maybe that does become a concern, any service companies do start get maybe some pricing power. Would just love your thoughts on that. Travis Stice : Yes, Ben, our business partners on the service side as I pointed out earlier, they are under quite a bit of distress right now and they are very smart individuals and running their business and they know the importance of keeping good crews and good equipment. Regardless of our pace of activity we expect end demand good service for a fair price and the service companies our business partners respond accordingly. Now when recovery occurs inactivity starts to ramp up there probably will be some things exposed that you cannot see right under a much slower development activity, but we think that since Diamondback should be one of the first companies to go back to work under a recovery oil price that we will be able to attract the best crews and the best equipment as we start ramping up activities. Could it be a problem in the future? Yes, but right now there sure a lot of surplus equipment around both on the pressure pumping and on the drilling rig site. Operator : The next question is from [indiscernible] of BMO Capital Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Can you speak further to how quickly a DUC can be converted to a well that's producing and online questions just asking to get a better sense of how quickly you can capture a steeper [indiscernible] on the oil curve if that were to materialize. Travis Stice : Dan, the first thing is you placed your call into the pressure pumping provider and you find out what their availability is and what their cost is and right now cost are low and availability is high. In theory you can go to work on the DUCs right away. Now there are some things we have to do on the front end of that like a accumulation, stimulation fluid, making sure the location is prep for the completion but those are things that we do on the day in and day out basis so really when it is time to match on the accelerator you know as I pointed out earlier we will start on the DUCs and with a fully dedicated crew we can get about -- you can get four to five wells a month per dedicated group. So you can start to eat into a quarter you can start eat into your drill on uncompleted backlog pretty quick. Unidentified Analyst : And then lastly how much further east off your Glasscock County lease line would you go to acquire more acreage assuming such acreage is available? Travis Stice : We like where our acreage is right now, I don\u2019t think moving east from our position. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Sam Burwell of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Sam Burwell : I was wondering if you can quantify a little bit the share of completions this year that would be 10,000 for laterals and if that share or that percentage would change meaningfully depending on the activity scenarios you guys end up with? Travis Stice : That\u2019s probably about 40% or 50% would be 10,000-foot laterals and three time I think the percentage is probably going to increase as we try the acreage, more for a acreage you will see those lateral lengths continue to increase over time. Sam Burwell : And just seek one more in, hedging. You guys are still unhedged, I was wondering what would the curve have to look like especially in say 2017 for you guys to consider laying around some hedges? Travis Stice : We would like to have a large hedge book right now that looks like cash on the balance sheet which by the way is how we view hedges. Probably so but that being said we also now we believe are going to be able to participate in the most fullest way in an oil price recovery. So I don\u2019t want to give a specific number but the [indiscernible] nature of the curve right now would probably lead us maybe to start thinking about hedges somewhere north of where it is right now. I think I saw a quote this morning that next year's hedges are right around $40 a barrel so we probably need something little north of that. But it depends Sam, it depends on what we think the future of the oil price is going to do and what our activity levels are going to look like and it's not just a binary decision that we struggle with daily on how to put hedges on there but that being said though we've got as we pointed out cash on the balance sheet from our equity raise that\u2019s sort of in a way looks like a hedges well so I think we are in pretty good shape. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from David Meats of Morningstar. Your line is open. David Meats : Most of my questions have been answered but one last one on the table on slide 6 which is looking in the $65 to $75 scenario you\u2019ve got 2600 locations that\u2019s 200 more than in the 55 to 65 scenario. I'm just wondering if there's any way, any scenario or possibility to upgrade those 200 locations and make them work at the $55 to $65 level? Is there something you guys can do or some circumstances that would make that happen? Travis Stice : Yes, I think those wells are generally short lateral wells that takes a higher price to make economic and as I indicated before oil companies are working on data traits to core of their acreage just to drill longer laterals so that's really what it is probably going to take to make those wells economic and I think the chance of doing that is pretty high. Operator : At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Manager of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint first quarter 2016 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release, issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners first quarter 2016 conference call. During the first quarter of 2016, commodity prices tested lows not seen in the past several years. As such, and consistent with our strategy of capital discipline and maximizing stockholder returns, we slowed our 1Q completion activity and now have an inventory of nearly 30 drilled but uncompleted wells. As a result of increased activity associated with running a third drilling rig longer than we initially anticipated and recently picking up an additional frac crew, we are raising the low end of our full year guidance to 34,000 BOEs per day from 32,000 BOEs per day. We anticipate some lumpiness in the second quarter production with the response from completions associated with the second frac crew expected in the second half of this year. Should crude prices continue to strengthen, we could pick up a fourth horizontal rig early in the third quarter. Alternatively, if prices soften from current levels, we could stay at three drilling rigs or less and again moderate the pace of completions. With over $230 million in cash and an undrawn credit facility, we're well-positioned to increase activity levels without stressing the balance sheet. When you compare our current financial position to nearly two years ago when oil price was at its peak, our balance sheet is now stronger, we have more liquidity and higher credit ratings. I'm proud that we've been able to become even stronger financially during the past year. Also, we continue to lower well costs and operating expenses through efficiency gains, optimization, and cost concessions. Our execution metrics continue to improve across the board, even as we begin development in new areas like Howard and Glasscock Counties. All-in cash costs for the quarter, including LOE, G&A, transportation and production taxes, are currently below $10 per barrel, demonstrating how lean and efficient the Diamondback organization operates. We are pleased with the performance of our first five Glasscock County completions, which are exceeding our expectations at the time of the acquisition. This week, we intend to begin completion of wells in our new core area in Howard County, where offset activity remains very encouraging. We expect to see more opportunities to grow our company and believe our proven track record of execution and low-cost operations makes us a natural consolidator within the Permian Basin. While we evaluate all deals in the Permian, we will only do transactions that we believe are accretive to our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback continues to post encouraging results and achieve new company execution records. Slide seven shows that on average our Glasscock County wells are tracking a 1 million BOE type curve. Our Riley wells were completed using a higher sand concentration and early production time results for these wells are very encouraging. Slide eight shows pure activity in Howard County, where we will begin completing our first three-well pad this week. As a reminder, we have drilled two pads that target the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A, and Wolfcamp B intervals. Slide 10 shows that Diamondback continues to drill wells faster than offsetting peers in all of our core operating areas. During the first quarter of 2016, we drilled a 9,800-foot lateral well in Howard County in less than 11 days from spud to TD. We also drilled a 7,300-foot lateral well in Spanish Trail in under 10 days from spud to TD, a new company record in Midland County. Lastly, in April 2016, we drilled two wells with 10,000-foot laterals in Andrews County in 25 days from spud of the first well to rig release of the second. Slide 11 shows our current realized well cost reductions, which have come down roughly 35% since the peak in 2014 and approximately 5% quarter-over-quarter. Leading edge drill, complete and equip costs are trending below $5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral well and between $6 million and $6.5 million for a 10,000-foot lateral well. Slide 12 shows reductions to our current realized lease operating expenses since the peak in 2014. We are extremely proud of our production organization for continuing to lower operating expenses. We have reduced LOE from over $8 a barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $5.23 per BOE in the first quarter of 2016 due to reduced cost and further improved pumping practices. As a result, we have lowered our LOE guidance to $5.50 to $6.50 per BOE from a prior range of $6 to $7 per BOE. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's first quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $60 million. Our first quarter 2016 average realized price per BOE, including hedges, was approximately $27. During the quarter, our cash G&A costs were $1.33 per BOE, while non-cash G&A was $2.39. During the quarter, our capital spend for drilling, completing and equipping wells was $76 million. Our infrastructure costs were $5 million, and we paid $4 million on our non-operated properties. A portion of first quarter capital was related to fourth quarter 2015 activities. We spent an additional $19 million on acquisitions during the first quarter of 2016. Diamondback is in an enviable position as a company that has a stronger balance sheet, more liquidity and a higher credit rating than it did when oil was at its peak. At the end of March 2016, we were undrawn on our secured revolving credit facility. With over $230 million in cash and $500 million in undrawn revolver capacity, we have ample liquidity to fund our budgeted 2016 drilling program. Our net debt to annualized first quarter 2016 EBITDA is 1.1 times, as shown on slide 13. Our practice of limiting our commitment to a portion of our borrowing base again reflects our track record of financial discipline. Moving to slide 14, we provide our guidance for 2016. As announced last night, we increased our 2016 production guidance to a range of 34,000 BOE per day to 38,000 BOE per day. As a result of picking up a second dedicated completion crew, we now expect to complete a range of 35 to 70 gross wells. We have also lowered our 2016 LOE guidance range to $5.50 to $6.50 per BOE from a prior range of $6 to $7. I'll now turn to Viper Energy Partners, which announced a cash distribution last night of $0.149 per unit for the first quarter. Viper has no minimum quarterly distributions or complex ownership hierarchies. The majority of cash flow is returned to unitholders through quarterly distribution providing upside when oil prices rebound. Spanish Trail remains one of the most economic areas in the Permian Basin and we expect the operators will complete their backlog of over 20 DUCs with continued strength in oil prices. At the end first quarter 2016, Viper had $43 million drawn on its revolver. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback again delivered a strong quarter, demonstrating what we do best : reduce costs and expenses, improve execution, and demonstrate capital flexibility in response to commodity prices. We've gotten stronger financially and are poised to accelerate into an oil price recovery. We are pleased with the early well results in Glasscock County and continue to be optimistic about Howard County potential. We look forward to sharing our initial Howard County results in the upcoming quarters. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. And our first question or comment comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann: Morning, everyone. Nice quarter again. Travis, for you or the guys there, just how do you think about when you (10:50) these days about an optimal well either in Howard, Glasscock, or obviously the Spanish Trail in relation to sand per foot lateral length? I guess kind of a lot of people are obviously throwing a lot more sand at it. I'm just wondering maybe in those particular things, how you think about let's just stick with lateral length and amount of sand you're looking at? Travis D. Stice: Sure. Well, the lateral length question is a little easier and I think it's also more well understood, longer is certainly better. In fact, here in a couple of months, Diamondback is going to be drilling our first 13,000-foot laterals. On sand per foot, we continue to test and follow the industry in putting more sand per foot. Our current average is running around 1,600 pounds per foot. We've got some tests that are coming up that will test even higher sand loadings. But in a general sense, we believe that the recipe has an efficient frontier of just the right amount of sand and while we don't know exactly what the answer is, we know it's somewhere, we believe, in that 1,600 pounds per foot to 2,000 pounds per foot. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. And then just last one if I could, how do you think about in either again the three areas just the optimal number of wells per pad? Does that just vary sort of pad per pad depending on exactly how contiguous the acreage, or what do you think about it, is that a three well, four well, or can you \u2013 will you start to even accelerate that as conditions improve? Travis D. Stice: Yes, so, Neal, I believe, if you're just looking for planning purposes, probably three wells, three stacked wells per pad, and then we'll move across depending on the density and the way we stagger the wells, somewhere between six and eight wells across the section. Certainly, we are very comfortable with three or more zones in Glasscock and Howard County and as we've seen in Midland County and some of the other areas, we've got potential for the Middle Spraberry and even the Jo Mill/Spraberry as well. Neal D. Dingmann: All right. Thank you, all. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. John Nelson : Yes, when I look at your slides, you guys put rig ranges of two to three for $30 to $45 a barrel and three to four at a $45 to $55 per barrel. You mentioned in your remarks you could add back a rig in early 3Q. I'm just curious is this a function of seeing continued improvement from well economics or is this just a view that oil prices will continue to move higher? Travis D. Stice: Yes, John, it's actually a little bit of both, but I think the reason we leave that range out there is because we want to be able to respond when we see strengthening oil prices. We've got $45 to $55, we'll say we run three to four rigs. Our rate of returns for all these wells, particularly in Midland County, are ranging somewhere between 50% and 100% rate of return. So we've got a lot of opportunities to drill extremely high rate of return wells. So, we're not looking for economic improvements and we're not looking for well costs to be down from where they are now to help make the decisions. We're really focused on the macro conditions on our oil market and then the near-term price forecast to make those decisions. But again, consistent with what we've always done and said, when returns to our investors are going up, we accelerate into that environment. John Nelson : That's helpful. And then just, can you remind us, on the fourth rig, would that be reactivating a rig that's already under contract, or would you guys be actually contracting a new rig? And if it's the latter, what sort of term would you be looking to lock up potentially? Travis D. Stice: John, it'd be a reactivation of a well we currently \u2013 of a rig we currently have warm stacked on one of our locations. John Nelson : Okay. And then I had just one high-level question, if I could. When you think about acquisitions, do you look as hard at Delaware Basin assets, or do you think that maybe Diamondback doesn't currently have sufficient scale or the well economics would be inferior that you don't want to stay continued to focus on the Midland Basin? Travis D. Stice: We continue to look at numerous opportunities in Delaware Basin. What I talk to my business development group about is as we look at different opportunities, are we upgrading our portfolio? In other words, and said simply, is the average well in the new opportunity at or above the midpoint of the well in our current portfolio? And if it's not, it feels like a dilution to our inventory, and at this point those treads are hard for us to do. But no, we're certainly continuing to look not only \u2013 everywhere in the Midland Basin, but also in the Delaware. John Nelson : Is there a certain scale you think you'd need to be to move into the Delaware? Or is it simply if those assets are above the average of the portfolio you could bolt on even smaller levels? Travis D. Stice: Yes, it really gets back to the economics of the decision. At what price and what returns do we think we can generate our shareholders, and then secondary or tertiary down the line is what size it is. John Nelson : All right. That's very, very helpful. I'll let somebody else jump on. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael A. Glick: Morning. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Mike. Michael A. Glick: So several operators are testing multiple down spacing concepts in the Lower Spraberry in and around your acreage. Could you speak to your view on how well density ultimately plays out in that zone? And then also, do you see the potential for multiple benches (16:43) move into your Northern acreage? Travis D. Stice: Mike, we believe that the testing that's going on in (16:54) right now is appropriate. We're testing down spacing as well and we intend to be fast followers on that. I think you have to be careful in down spacing based on our industry's experience to avoid over-capitalizing a section. That being said, though, we've got to put the drill bit tighter and in more laterals to come up with that ultimate final answer. And we're doing it, other operators are doing it as well, and it's sort of one of those stories that is going to be evolving. We tend to be a little bit more cautious, but certainly as well densities increase and additional stacked pays are tested, that rising tide lifts all the ships here in the Northern Midland Basin. Michael A. Glick: All right. And then from a high level, you guys continue to improve on both the efficiency and productivity side. Maybe could you speak to kind of what inning do you think we're in from Diamondback's perspective on both fronts? Travis D. Stice: I think the remarkable thing about the Permian Basin, and I think we're in our 95th year since our discovery well, is that we're almost a basin that's perpetually in the third or fourth inning. And that's because there's just so much hydrocarbons in the strat column that things like technology improvements, horizontal drilling, fracking technologies, all of those things perpetually bring you back in the third or fourth inning. As I sit here today and I look at our costs and our execution and I look at our operations organization and say can you give me more, it feels like, unless there's a substantial technological breakthrough, that we're getting close to the bottom in costs and close to the maximum in efficiencies. But that doesn't mean from Diamondback's perspective we won't continue to push and where a couple of years ago we were probably saving quarters and dimes, right now we're picking up pennies. And every little bit matters. And it's just a remarkable basin to be developing, the Permian is, with all the oil that's in place. Michael A. Glick: And then last one from me, could you just speak to the service industry's capacity to respond to accelerating activity in the Midland Basin? Travis D. Stice: Mike, I think obviously the calls that the public service guys are making, they're best equipped to respond to that. I think if the industry was to all of a sudden mash the accelerator completely to the floor and stand up 100 drilling rigs in the Permian Basin, we would have a hard time, I would believe, on the pressure pumping side, immediately responding to that. But if we do a prudent build into a new norm of drilling rigs, I mean we're running, what, less than 130 rigs out here in the Permian right now, and that's down from 560 just a few years ago. If we build into that environment, I believe our service \u2013 the service sector, our business partners can appropriately build their organizations back up to respond to the operators' needs. That's certainly the conversations I have with my business partners at Diamondback. Michael A. Glick: Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Somewhat related question on the completion side, and well going back to your presentation, I guess you indicated some pretty good efficiencies on the drilling side, I should say, and I was just trying to get a sense on the completions. How much are the completions impacted by efficiency gains, and to what extent are those sustainable in an upturn where industry's adding rigs and drilling more wells? Travis D. Stice: Probably a little bit different than what we see on the drilling side, the majority of the costs that are associated with completion are tied up with the pressure pumping. And the pressure pumping guys, as commodity prices call for increased activity, they're going to have to go and repair their balance sheets, and so I anticipate costs increasing at some point in the future, probably not in the next quarter or so, but some point in the future, and as such, most of that will transfer right back to the operators. So, are we doing things on the completion side to make our completions more efficient? Absolutely, we are. But I would say to a larger degree on the pressure pumping side, we're relying on our business partners to provide fair prices at good services. Gordon Douthat : Okay. Makes sense. And then another question I had was just given the results in Glasscock look pretty solid, how do they compare to your initial expectations? And then given the 1 million barrel a day type curve, give or take, how do those wells compete within the portfolio now? Travis D. Stice: Well, certainly the wells are in the top quartile of our portfolio, at least certainly in the Wolfcamp A. We've been extremely pleased with the Wolfcamp A, and it's competing now with \u2013 almost competing with some of our wells in Midland County, some of the Lower Spraberry wells in Midland County. The Lower Spraberry that we tested, which was \u2013 there weren't a lot of data points in this portion of Glasscock County in the Lower Spraberry, and as I reported in my last call, we were really pleasantly surprised and I think we've released an IP30 rate in our investor presentation right now that continues to embolden. This is, I think, about 1,125 BOEs a day for an IP30. So again, that was a very strong Lower Spraberry well, and that'll be in the top quartile of our portfolio as well. So both the Wolfcamp A and the Lower Spraberry are well above our expectations at the acquisition time. The Wolfcamp B is about in line with our expectation. So, two out of the three zones are significantly above our expectations. So on average it makes the whole strat column look better. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And you put these on ESP? Travis D. Stice: Yes, what we've decided to do early on in our development scenario is as we move into areas which we feel have strategic significance to us that we want to try to eliminate as many variables as we can, and whether it's in Glasscock County or Howard County, the initial wells that we put in there we always put on ESP and that way that allows us to compare ESP performance in the way that the flowing bottom oil pressure declines over time to wells that we do have a good control like in Midland County. So, we believe that that's the best way to do it initially. Are there applications for gas lift? Absolutely, there are. You probably save maybe as much as $100,000 to $150,000 per well. But they do have a little bit more operational uncertainties with them as opposed to an ESP. And just one other point on the ESP that my operations guys continue to remind me, is that as we move into areas where we have a dense spacing of horizontal wells and we frac and we put frac water in the offset wells, it's a whole lot easier to go back out there and turn the rheostats up, speed up the sub pumps and pull the water out of the section. And so overall this whole section starts producing oil sooner than it did, sooner than it would have had we had those wells on gas lift. So there is an economic offset, positive offset, to the increased upfront costs. Gordon Douthat : All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Kashy Harrison with Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Kashy Harrison : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Excellent work on just bringing down costs on a quarter-over-quarter basis with the well costs now trending below $5 million, was wondering if you could just provide some color on some of the drivers of the cost reductions relative to what you presented last quarter. And then just thinking about a recovering commodity environment, how much of this cost, how much of those savings do you think are sustainable? So for example, for the 7,500-foot lateral wells, if they cost $5 million today, in a $50 to $60 environment, what do you think that moves up to? Michael L. Hollis: Kashy, this is Mike Hollis. I'll try to answer both of those for you. On the cost front, a lot of the savings are coming from some of the optimizations on the drilling side as well as some pricing that we are getting on the pressure pumping side. We're seeing about, quarter-over-quarter, about 5% reduction in cost of goods and services; pipes, steel iron that we buy and use in the wells. But as far as the drilling side, it's typically speed with which we drill, modified case and designs, where we're running shallower casings. And then on the pressure pumping side, it's current pricing that we're getting from the industry right now. As far as the stickiness of this current price environment, as we all get back to work in the next few quarters, until the iron gets utilized out of the yard, I think we will continue to see these lower prices stick around for a while. But as the other basins tend to pick up work, so whether it's $50, $60 oil and the Eagle Ford and the Bakken start getting to work, you'll start seeing these guys have to raise their prices, because they have a lot more competition for the iron. Kashy Harrison : Thanks for the color there. And on the operating expense side of things, in one of the slides, you highlighted that 90% of oil productions is going to be on pipe by the end of the year and 80% of the water will be piped to saltwater disposal. Could you maybe just shed some color on what LOE may look like by the end of this year on a per barrel basis? Michael L. Hollis: You bet. The oil pipeline, that's more of in our realized prices that we see. The water side, again, every time we come into a new area, that's one of the first things we do, is build the infrastructure out for both supply and removal of fluids from the wells. So as we go forward again, a lot of it's going to depend on the volume forecasts and what oil prices do, but if we keep a fairly flat oil price, it will be fair to say that we should have fairly flat LOE for what we have in our guidance. If oil prices pull back and we pull back activity and migrate to the midpoint of our production range, you'll see those LOE costs go up slightly. Kashy Harrison : Got it. And just shifting gears to Viper, I was just wondering if you all could shed some light on the current A&D market in the mineral space. If there's any color you can shed there? Travis D. Stice: Yes, and we don't typically like to talk about acquisitions that we have under current evaluation, but I can just say in a general sense, that the deal flow on the Viper side has moved up materially late last year and through the first quarter of this year. So Viper is fully engaged in trying to deliver some accretive deals to its unitholders. Kashy Harrison : Okay. Well, thanks for the color, there, and thanks for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Jason A. Wangler: Hey. Good morning, guys. Mike, you may have touched on it a bit there, but was just curious, the slide 10 that shows obviously the really solid days of drilling, it seems to me at least that as you look at those graphs, specifically Howard and Glasscock, that the first, call it, 8,000 feet, basically the vertical portion of that well really gets down a lot quicker than all the peers. I think you mentioned the shallower casing in a previous answer. But was just curious if there's something operationally different that you guys are seeing there, for lack of a better word, gives you guys a really good head start getting these wells down quicker? Michael L. Hollis: In general, the modified casing design is more in the Western side of the basin. We're very early into Howard and Glasscock. So we'll continue to push the envelope there. So you're not really getting that benefit yet in those areas. What you're seeing here is just blocking and tackling that we do every day. It's good research in the area and it's just good drilling practices that we try to employ. I wish I could say there was secret sauce to being able to deliver that kind of performance, but it's essentially just good hard work from the guys in the field. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. I appreciate it. And then just maybe for Tracy, just on the tax side, just kind of cleaning up some numbers, obviously there wasn't any effective tax rate this quarter. Is the thought process going forward, maybe just for modeling purposes what we should be looking at? Teresa L. Dick: Yes, I would suggest that internally I'm modeling no taxes for the remainder of this year. This is a result of the impairments we had been booking over the last few quarters as prices start to flatten out over the last really 12 months we could get back into a tax position, but I don't foresee that until probably 2017. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Timothy A. Rezvan: Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to change gears a bit and ask about differentials, if we look at both Diamondback and Viper, we've seen kind of some volatility across all hydrocarbons. I know that Viper has other operators kind of producing some of its barrels. But can you kind of explain what that variability was and maybe give us a thought on what we can expect the rest of the year? Travis D. Stice: Tim, I'm not sure that we've specifically studied that specific question. I can tell you that we've got guidance in there both at the Viper level and the Diamondback level that I would anticipate kind of what you've seen is more consistent what we're going to see going forward. Timothy A. Rezvan: Okay. So there's nothing on the NGL sort of processing side or regarding ethane to drive kind of realizations for the first quarter? Russell Pantermuehl : Yes, I mean, there's a couple things. I mean, one is the amount of ethane rejection that does affect that. The other thing is, as prices get lower, you've got fixed T&S fees. So as prices get lower, it makes your differential look bigger. So hopefully we've got some price improvement on the NGL side, that differential will go down as well. Timothy A. Rezvan: Okay. Okay. That's fair. Just you saw $0.35 deterioration from 4Q to 1Q in gas for FANG, and kind of similar move down for Viper. That's all. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Downey with Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. Brian Downey : Great. Nice quarter, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just quick one, given that first quarter production came in at the high end of the full year guidance, can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the general production trajectory towards the rest of the year? I know you'd mentioned a lumpy second quarter, but just curious as to how we should think about the moving parts as we head into the back half of the year. Travis D. Stice: Sure. I think as Adam explains it, when we talk about it internally, we look at our production more in a J-shape recovery with most of the completions as I outlined with the second frac crew impacting 3Q and 4Q. That being said, though, we have to be a little careful on thinking what we're going to do quarter-over-quarter, because we don't guide to the quarter. One of the reasons is because we can move into a quarter or out of a quarter, a three-well or four-well stacked pad depending on logistics and how quickly we can get to those and if we bring one into a quarter, and they're three-well or four-well pads bringing 3,000 barrels a day or 4,000 barrels a day, you could have a material impact on the quarter. So again, why we stick towards an annual guide is because of that somewhat difficulty in forecasting when these stacked pads come on. Brian Downey : Great. And if I think about the potential for a fourth rig, as you mentioned, should I think about if that's a 3Q event that probably might get a little bit in the fourth quarter but that's more affecting 2017 type volumes? Travis D. Stice: Yes, that'd be building into a recovering oil price commodity tape and more late this year, maybe exit volumes but primarily 2017. Brian Downey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Stevens with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Chris S. Stevens: Hey. Good morning, guys. Travis, maybe I could just touch on the Delaware Basin M&A again. Have you seen acreage out there that you think would be accretive to your average inventory quality? And if so, I guess is it really more a question of valuation at this point or do you think the Delaware just doesn't really compete with what you have on the Midland Basin side? Travis D. Stice: No, there's portions of the Delaware that we believe can compete. And I'm not saying that's where necessarily the trades are occurring, but in a general sense we just continue to look at the Delaware from Northern Delaware to Southern Delaware and we evaluate it relative to what's currently in our portfolio and try to make good decisions based on that that are going to be accretive to our shareholders. So, probably more a valuation point. Chris S. Stevens: Oh. Okay, got it. And then I guess what are the expectations on Howard County at this point? What you have over in Spanish Trail and now Glasscock both look pretty tremendous. I guess what do you guys think in terms of how Howard County's going to fit into the pecking order at this point? Travis D. Stice: Well, we updated \u2013 what slide's that, Adam? We updated in our slide deck some new well data points for that in Howard County on slide eight. And I made the comment when we acquired this asset about this time last year that this was the most de-risked acquisition Diamondback had ever made. So as you peruse the data that's on slide eight, you can see why we continue to be emboldened on the results from the wells and we're going to be pumping sand down hole here in a few days and we'll have what we believe are some good tests in our October call where we'll at least have a 30-day rate on our first three-well pad and probably some early indications from our second three-well pad. But if you just look at the data over there, it looks pretty strong. Chris S. Stevens: Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question or comment comes from the line of John Aschenbeck with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. John Aschenbeck : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a follow-up on extended laterals. A two-part question, really, and that is what percentage of your acreage would you estimate, ballpark figure, is currently amenable to longer laterals, let's call it 10,000-foot plus? And then secondly, how many of 2016's 35 to 70 completions, again, ballpark figure, would you estimate around that 10,000-foot plus range? Travis D. Stice: I'm going to let Russell answer that question. Russell Pantermuehl : Yes, it obviously varies by area, but I think probably we'd say about 70% of our acreage, we can drill 10,000-foot laterals and probably for the wells we'll drill and complete this year I think that number's in the 60% to 65% range. So what's happened is we've been successful in trading acreage and pooling acreage to drill longer laterals because not just us but the rest of the industry wants to. So like our Glasscock acreage, it's probably in that 70%, 10,000-foot laterals and Howard may end up being up a little higher than that. John Aschenbeck : Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. So with that said, I would like to turn the conference back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and operation instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint second quarter 2016 conference call. During our call today we'll reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback's web site. We've also posted an updated Viper presentation, which can be found on Viper's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance of businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call of the Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners second quarter 2016 conference call. While our industry faced a challenging start to 2016, during the second quarter commodity prices improved and Diamondback began to reaccelerate the pace of activity by adding a second frac crew in May and a fourth drilling rig last month. We expect the majority of our current inventory of 20 drilled but uncompleted wells to be completed by the end of this year, putting us in a position of strength as we enter into 2017. As a reminder, we recently increased our production guidance range to 38,000 to 40,000 BOEs a day from 34,000 to 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Additionally, we continue to evaluate adding a fifth drilling rig before the end of this year should commodity prices strengthen. This rig would likely focus within the footprint of our pending Southern Delaware Basin transaction, which we expect to close in September. Last month, we announced our strategic entry into the Delaware Basin through the pending accretive acquisition of approximately 19,180 net acres for $560 million. This acreage is primarily located along the Pecos River in Reeves and Ward Counties, with an estimated 1,000 barrels a day of production and 2.2 million barrels of estimated net proved developed reserves. We have identified 290 net locations with an average lateral length of approximately 9,500 feet across four zones with potential horizontal upside from additional zones and further down spacing. This acquisition will provide Diamondback with a strategic foothold in the core oil window of the Southern Delaware Basin at a lower entry price and greater potential for bolt-on acquisitions than what we find in the Midland Basin. As shown on slide eight, the acreage contains greater thickness and we believe more oil in place than in Spanish Trail, which we expect to translate into greater EURs per lateral foot. We're excited to start developing the asset and plan to begin there later this year. Diamondback continues to deliver on best-in-class operating expenses as a result of execution and a persistent focus on a lean, low-cost organization. We are pleased with the performance from our Howard County wells, which confirm the productivity of this acreage. We are continuing to develop the asset and will provide more results in the coming months. Switching to Viper Energy Partners, since Viper's initial public offering in June of 2014, Viper has acquired over 2,100 net royalty acres for less than $270 million, including the recent acquisitions of 601 net royalty acres in the Midland Basin and the pending 142 net royalty acres in the Delaware Basin for an aggregate of approximately $111 million. Additionally, since the IPO, Viper has increased its production by 185%, including over 135% of organic production growth with potential drilling inventory increasing by nearly 200% and proved reserves by more than 170%. The pending and recently acquired mineral assets will provide significant growth opportunities in the most actively developed areas of the Permian Basin and are expected to be immediately accretive on a cash flow basis. We have highlighted additional information on these acquisitions on slide 11 and 12 in the Diamondback presentation. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback continues to post encouraging results and achieve new company execution records. Slide 13 shows early performance in Howard County, where we recently completed our first operated pad consisting of three wells targeting the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B intervals. The Wolfcamp A well achieved an average peak 30-day IP rate of 1,374 BOE per day, 89% of which was oil, while the Wolfcamp B well achieved an average 30-day IP rate of 1,225 BOE per day with an 83% oil cut. This confirms two distinct economic reproductive zones within the Wolfcamp on our acreage position. The Lower Spraberry well continues to clean up and has not yet reached peak production. Diamondback plans to complete another three-well pad by the end of 2016 targeting the same three zones and we are conducting a micro-seismic and tracer survey to continue to enhance completion optimization. Slide 14 shows extended performance from our Glasscock County wells, which continue to track a 1 billion barrel pipe run (6:16) on average. We are currently flowing back two more wells and expect to have results in the coming months. Slide 16 shows that Diamondback continues to drill wells at peer-leading levels. During the second quarter of 2016, we drilled two 10,000-plus foot lateral wells in less than nine days each from spud to TD, which is our fastest time ever for a 10,000-foot lateral. We also drilled a 10,800-foot lateral well in Spanish Trail in 10.5 days from spud to TD, a new company record in Midland County. Our well costs have come down roughly 43% since the peak in 2014 and approximately 2% quarter-over-quarter. Leading edge drill, complete and equip costs are trending below $6 million for a 10,000-foot lateral well and below $5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral well. Diamondback continues to maintain a rate of return focused completion optimization program. We are testing high-density near wellbore fracs, diversion agents, nanosurfactants and dissolvable plugs. These tests are ongoing as we continue to weigh the benefits of each technique versus the additional cost. Slide 17 shows reductions to our operating expenses since the peak in 2014. Looking back a year ago, we have reduced our LOE by 26% to $5.57 per BOE in the second quarter of 2016 due to improved pumping practices and service cost concessions. As a result, we've recently reduced our LOE guidance to a range of $5.50 to $6.25 per BOE, down from $5.50 to $6.50 per BOE previously. Our ability to keep driving down costs reflects the efforts of our team to continue to implement efficient and sustainable improvements. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's second quarter 2016 net income adjusted for non-cash derivative losses and impairment was $19 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $78 million. Our second quarter 2016 average realized price per BOE including hedges was approximately $33. During the quarter, our cash G&A costs were $1.04 per BOE while non-cash G&A costs were $1.80. During the quarter, our capital spent for drilling, completing and equipping was $55 million. Our infrastructure costs were $6 million and we payed $4 million on our non-operated properties. We spent an additional $10 million on acquisitions during the second quarter of 2016. At the end of June 2016, we were undrawn on our secured revolving credit facility. With over $219 million in cash and $500 million in undrawn revolver capacity, we have ample liquidity to fund our budgeted 2016 drilling program. Our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is 0.8 times, as shown on slide 18. Our practice of limiting our commitment to a portion of our borrowing base again reflects our track record of financial discipline. Moving to slide 19, we provide our guidance for 2016. In July, we updated our guidance to reflect continued strong well performance and increased drilling and completion activity. As part of that update, we now expect to complete 60 to 75 gross wells and have increased our full-year 2016 production guidance to a range of 38,000 to 40,000 BOE per day, up 11% from February 2016 guidance. Also, we increased CapEx guidance to $350 million to $425 million as a result of increased activity in 2016. This will primarily be reflected in 2017 volumes. Additionally, we lowered our 2016 LOE guidance range to $5.50 to $6.25 per BOE. Subsequently, we have lowered 2016 DD&A guidance range to $11 to $13 per BOE, down from the prior range of $13 to $15 per BOE. I'll now turn to Viper Energy Partners, which announced on July 25 a cash distribution of $0.189 per unit for the second quarter. This is up 27% from prior quarter. As a reminder, Viper has no required quarterly distributions or complex ownership hierarchy. The majority of cash flow is returned to unitholders through quarterly distributions, providing upside when oil prices rebound. As Spanish Trail remains one of the most economic areas in the Permian Basin, we expect the current DUC backlog will be significantly reduced by the end of 2016. As in its July 25 release, there are 35 DUCs on Viper's acreage. This includes approximately 10 wells that are normal inventory. At the end of the second quarter 2016, Viper had $51.5 million drawn on its revolver. This increased to $132.5 million on July 25 to finance recent acquisitions. Following the close of Viper's recent common unit offering, we expect outstanding borrowings will be reduced by $78 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another strong quarter because of our commitment to execution and low-cost operations. Our financial flexibility allows us to respond quickly when prices improve, and we remain well-positioned to bring value forward across our asset base. We are pleased with early results in Howard and Glasscock Counties, increased acquisition activity at the Viper level and are excited to begin development in the Southern Delaware Basin. Before I open the call for questions, I want to pause and acknowledge our employees for the extraordinary effort they continue to show, especially with all of our activity in the month of July. I'm extremely grateful that I get to work with such dedicated and focused colleagues. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. John Nelson : Good morning and congratulations on the Southern Delaware Basin entrance. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, John. John Nelson : I have two questions, a modeling one and then a higher level one. The modeling one first, regarding working interest. I think the Delaware Basin acquisition press release said we should expect at least one rig on the assets in 2017. And as I look at the working interest, it's a bit lower than I think what you typically have over in the Midland Basin side at roughly 50%. I guess using the $80 million to $100 million per year per rig line rule of thumb, just wanted to check, should we be thinking about baseline capital in 2017 as just that $40 million to $50 million because of the lower working interest? Or should we think about something else? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, John, I think your math is correct. We're going to start on the higher working interest wells to begin with. So as we move a rig in there later this year and certainly the early drilling in 2017 will be focused on much higher net interest wells. And so I would stay with what your earlier number was, around $80 million to $100 million per rig. John Nelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then second question, more higher level. I think the Diamondback team is generally regarded by investors as having been successful in executing bolt-on acquisitions in a manner that's shareholder friendly. So I guess I'm just trying to think about as you do step into the Delaware Basin and you paid what at time what was the highest price per acre I think that had been paid by an operator, could you just maybe speak to the underlying quality of these assets or what you think is undervalued? And should we as investors really be expecting Delaware's acreage prices to be moving higher from here? Travis D. Stice: Well, I think, John, about a week after Diamondback made the announcement there was another large transaction made that was about 30% or 40% higher on the per acre costs than what Diamondback paid for its acreage. So I think the bigger story in the Delaware is the rate of change. The operators over there have quickly optimized the lateral landing point. They've enhanced the completion techniques to make them more competitive. And I think, like I said my prepared remarks, I think the opportunity for Diamondback to continue to do what we've always done, which is do accretive bolt-on acquisitions, is there. And while we don't talk specifically about what our acquisition activity is, I think it's reasonable to assume that, just like in the Midland Basin, Diamondbacks fingerprints will be all over the trades in the Delaware Basin as well. John Nelson : Great. I'll let somebody else hop on. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Michael A. Glick: Good morning. Just thought on Howard County... Travis D. Stice: Morning, Michael. Michael A. Glick: On Howard County, obviously impressive results out of the gate and understanding it's early days there. How do you think that area stacks up versus your other areas? And maybe higher level, how are thinking about allocating rigs and capital between your core areas in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin? Travis D. Stice: Well, Michael, your first comment was the correct one. We try not to make too many far-reaching decisions based on a 30-day IP rate, but certainly we're very, very pleased with how these wells have started off. The Wolfcamp A, particularly if it continues to hold in there, it's going to be competitive with some of the Lower Spraberry wells we have in Midland County. And as we look forward to increasing activity levels, we've now got a very firmly established core development areas, not only in Howard County, where that will hold one rig, or in Glasscock County, also hold one rig. So if you look at what we've intimated in 2017 and maybe by the end of this year to be at five rigs, you'd have four in the Midland Basin and one in the Delaware. And the four in the Midland Basin would be two in and around the Spanish Trail area and one in Howard and one in Glasscock. And then the bigger picture as we continue to accelerate activity with improving commodity prices, we've got these core areas now that can each handle a couple of rigs and we'll look forward to really bringing that value forward when commodity prices continue to improve. Michael A. Glick: Got it. And then switching over to the Delaware, could you maybe give us some color on how you're thinking about delineating that asset initially and how you're thinking about completion design on that side of the Basin versus the Midland Basin? Travis D. Stice: Well, we believe that the completion designs that we're seeing in the Midland Basin and some of the operators are doing in the Delaware Basin now are what we'd immediately started doing in the Delaware Basin, somewhere around 1,500 pounds a foot to 2,000 pounds per foot. We like the Third Bone Spring, we like the Wolfcamp A, and certainly those would be our initial target zones. Both of those based on offset well performance indicate close to 1 million-barrel type curves for both those two zones. So, again, like we always do, we put the drill bit in the zones that give our shareholders the greatest returns. And that's what we believed when we started development in the Delaware. Michael A. Glick: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Drew E. Venker: Good morning, everyone. Travis, you just mentioned that you like in the Delaware Basin the Wolfcamp A and the Third Bone Spring. Can you talk about how much will be delineation of those two zones across your position and testing other zones versus just developing the assets? Travis D. Stice: Well, Drew, I think go back to my earlier comment that Diamondback's known for always putting the drill bit in the highest rate-of-return zone, and that certainly where we'll start. And I think with a drilling rig there all of next year, we'll get 12 wells drilled and I think the majority of those wells will be in the Third Bone and the Wolfcamp A. And as also has been our style, there's a lot of activity in the Delaware and we intend to be fast followers. As other operators prove up additional zones, we'll monitor the rate of return that we can give our shareholders by putting the drill bit in those additional zones and we'll respond accordingly. Drew E. Venker: In terms the Bone Spring, a lot of your acreage is right along the river. Does that generally lead to the sand being more present on your acreage than being more discreet deposits? Adam T. Lawlis: We expect where we are, just south of the river there, that we've got similar reservoir characteristics in the Third Bone Springs as we do on that acreage just north of the river where we've seen some really good results. Drew E. Venker: So present, fairly widespread, somewhat similar to the Wolfcamp? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, I think in general, Drew, that's how we're thinking about it. Drew E. Venker: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Hey, Travis, just had a question on looking at your Delaware as far as, how do you tackle that? You mentioned \u2013 I know you've got a lot of perspective zones there. So going in there, I think you mention about working interest and all. But from a zone perspective, will you kind of just go in there like you have in the Midland and tackle a couple, two, three zones immediately on pads? Or how do you expect to do that? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, we think the most efficient way to do it is pad drilling. And how important efficiency is to Diamondback. So when we go in there, we'll likely look at stacked-pay development. But some of those decisions our asset teams are digging into right now as we put our development plan together and some of those things are being worked right now. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. And then just same thing in the Midland. I mean, as far as going forward now I guess more on Spanish Trail, is there still a lot of virgin area you have there, meaning could you come in there \u2013 are you coming back to existing wells that you have? Or are you going in there and just blanket coming in with these multi-well pads like you were originally? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, we're doing multi-well pads in Spanish Trail. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. And just following somebody else, I know it is early, but just your initial thoughts now after Howard versus something as obviously highly economic as Spanish Trail, how do you think those compare? Travis D. Stice: Well, I think the Wolfcamp A and, again, we have to tap the brakes a little bit on a 30-day IP rate. But the Wolfcamp A, if it holds in there like we think it will, appears to be competitive with the Lower Spraberry in Midland County. Neal D. Dingmann: Very good. Thanks, Travis. Travis D. Stice: And, Neal, just on that point, we think the Wolfcamp A down in Glasscock County looks also very robust. Neal D. Dingmann: And that's assuming current cost that you're on for both? Travis D. Stice: Correct. Neal D. Dingmann: Got it. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo. Gordon Douthat : Good morning, everybody. Question on M&A. To what extent does your entry into the Delaware perhaps signal that acreage opportunities on the Midland side of the Basin are drying up? And if indeed that is the case, what's your propensity to look at corporate type of transactions? Travis D. Stice: Gordon, again, we don't spend a lot of time talking about the M&A strategies publicly. We keep all those internal. But I have been on record as saying even since before the IPO, we've always looked at ways to grow the company accretively to our shareholders, and that includes corporate transactions. It also includes acreage transactions and small bolt-on deals. All of those tools to grow Diamondback accretively for our shareholders are things that we would continue to investigate. When you look at the most recent trade in the Northern Midland Basin, I think it was somewhere around $60,000 a net acre. And to the extent that sellers are emboldened by that acreage price, it's going to continue to be difficult to try to close that gap between bid and ask. So just like I said earlier, we continue to look at all deals. And Diamondback's fingerprints are on every trade that's out here in the Permian. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And then a question on the completion designs, specifically as it relates to slide 14 and Glasscock. From the chart there, it looks as if there were different proppant loadings on, let's see, the Saxon and the Riley pads. And it looks like the results are a bit varied. Any conclusions to be drawn, at least recognizing that it's a limited data set there? But given the early data you've seen, any there any conclusions to be drawn from the proppant loading side as it relates to well results? Michael L. Hollis: Gordon, on the Riley, so the Saxon wells were our first wells in the area in Glasscock. And as typical, we go in and try to complete them with what we consider our base completion technique. And we did that on the Saxons, all three zones. We came and did the Riley later, and we did a high-density frac on it. It's not quite our latest version of high-density near-wellbore, where we've changed some of the sand concentration differences as well as some of the pumping rates. But this one was basically our same job done more times within the well. We're looking at it from an economic standpoint, rate of return standpoint. We're getting enough data to where we can conclude that it is better or appears to be better as a two-point test. So again, we don't have a lot of data from different tests, but both wells do appear to be on a normalized footage basis doing better. We're still looking at what that rate of return is. We are testing other techniques in the area as well, so we'll have some more fulsome data that we can give you in the future. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And then one last one from me. Just looking at the oil and gas mix reported in the second quarter from you guys and then also from others in the Permian that have reported thus far, trending a bit more gassy. And I'm wondering is that a function of slowdown in activity in wells, the gas/oil ratio rising over time as they get a little longer in life? I guess can you discuss those trends and how you expect that to go going forward? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Gordon, it's hard to look \u2013 we don't give quarterly guidance, much less quarterly guidance on a gas cut. But in general all we're seeing is the effect of timing on our oil cut in this quarter. We only completed a few wells in the first quarter. And in the fourth quarter of last year, we completed a lot of wells. In the first quarter of this year, we had like a 76% oil cut. So I think in general, Gordon, just plan on about 74%, 75% oil as the best way to model Diamondback. Gordon Douthat : That's it for me. Thanks, everybody. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael A. Hall: Thanks. Good morning. A couple questions on my end and I guess just curious. You guys are really pushing on the long laterals where you can. How do you think about recoveries per foot on long laterals relative to somewhat shorter laterals and then how that compares to cost per foot? And have you approached a tip-over point? And what do you think the most efficient lateral length is at this point? Travis D. Stice: Well, we do believe, Michael, that there's a pretty direct linear relationship between EURs and lateral length. We believe longer is better. Right now we're currently drilling, what, a 13,500-foot well right now. So as long as \u2013 the longer we can drill these wells, the better economics we're going to be able to generate for our shareholders. I think somewhere in that 10,000 to 12,000-foot completed interval is probably going to be the sweet spot for now. But who knows? Technology continues to work in our favor to drill these wells longer and longer. Michael A. Hall: Okay. Helpful. And then on the Southern Delaware Basin asset, I'm just curious. As you ran out the acquisition economics on that originally, what rig ramp was contemplated and on what commodity price was that predicated on? Travis D. Stice: Well, I won't discuss the commodity price we used in our acquisition model, but I will give you our rig ramp. Michael A. Hall: Okay. Travis D. Stice: We talked about one rig in 2017 and we ramp one rig per year until we get to four rigs and we develop the rest of the asset at a four-rig cadence. Michael A. Hall: Okay. And I guess how would you think about maybe upside and downside risks around that rig ramp? Travis D. Stice: Well, it's all going to be a function of the performance of the rock and the commodity price we're receiving for that converting rock into cash flow equation we talk about. So as returns to our investors would go up, we would look to accelerate and bring forward value. But I think four rigs looks like the best cycle rate for drilling and completion operations on that acreage footprint. Michael A. Hall: Okay. Great. Helpful. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Wunderlich. Jason A. Wangler: Morning, Travis. You guys have always done a nice job of walking through how fast the drilling times are going and how quick they're getting. Can you talk about on the frac side how quickly and maybe how that's evolved over the last couple years, about how fast you're getting these fracs done, whether it's on the individual wells or on the pads, just to kind of get an assessment of that DUC count as we look forward for the rest of the year? Michael L. Hollis: Jason, this is Mike. As we continue to change the completion designs, it's more difficult to talk about the number of stages we do in a day because we've changed the size of the stages and the number of stages per rig \u2013 or per well. We try to look more at how much lateral foot we complete in a day. And we run roughly 1,500 to 2,000 foot of lateral length completed in a day. How that compares to in the past, it's pretty similar because in the past we did half as many stages, but they were twice as big. So it's about the same amount of time. So if you're looking at how many wells we can do per month per frac crew, it's roughly about five. But, again, as we continue to optimize and change that completion cadence and technique, it may move around a bit. But basically five 7,500 to 10,000-foot wells per frac crew per month. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Mike. And maybe just one other one. Again, the costs keep coming down. And obviously the last 18 months or so a lot of it was just the cyclical nature of the business and costs dropping. But it seems like those have started to level out and yet you're still being able to push these down. Are these costs we're seeing again probably because of the lower drill times, things that are, for lack of a better word, things that you can keep when we turn around and get back into maybe an upswing? Just maybe a comment on that. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, so, Jason, we're looking at about 30% to 40% on the drilling side of the savings that we've seen is from the optimization piece. Clearly, we're pushing and working to try to get cost concessions wherever we can, but we're also trying to do everything we can from the optimization side to be able to keep those if and when prices do move the other direction. And we're seeing that across the board on the completion side and the production side as well. Jason A. Wangler: Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back. Michael L. Hollis: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard, if your line is muted, could you please unmute the phone line? Did you just want me to go ahead and move on to the next questioner? Adam T. Lawlis: Sure. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from John Aschenbeck with Seaport Global. John Aschenbeck : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to get your thoughts here on how you think about near-term acceleration and activity. If you rewind only a matter of weeks ago, the strips closer to $50 and it seemed more likely than not that adding that fifth rig later this year made a lot of sense, almost like a sure thing. Fast forward to today, where oil prices have softened considerably and the fifth rig potentially seems less likely than previously. And if we hang around $40 flat, maybe it makes sense to add the one rig in the Delaware and then in 2017 actually drop to three rigs in the Midland, similar to what's laid out on your commodity price sensitivity analysis on slide 15. So, Travis, I know we'd all appreciate any type of color you could provide on how you're thinking about acceleration going forward, especially in regard to more qualitative factors and not just oil (33:48). Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Sure. John, I think the likelihood right now that we add that fifth rig later this year is still pretty high. If we needed, for whatever reason, to preserve some capital probably the first lever we would crank on would be to start building DUCs again in order to get some strategic drilling done in our newly-acquired Delaware Basin asset. We don't try to change our drilling schedule because we've had six or seven days of low commodity price. Whether this is an over-correction or a temporary pullback or if it's permanent, we'll just have to wait and see. But if you go back and look at what our behaviors have always been, that when returns to our investors go up, we accelerate activity into that environment. And returns go down, we also slow down activity. So what exactly that looks like towards the end of this year or into 2017, it's going to depend on those factors. Whether our returns \u2013 costs come down in conjunction with a lower commodity price, the fundamentalists of supply and demand, are they corrected and we believe recoveries imminent. So there's some macro factors that we have to also consider as we make these decisions. But again, from our financial strength position, we're not going to do anything that's going to put us in jeopardy. We've got cash on the balance sheet right now and we have an undrawn revolver. So we're in a pretty good position to be able to adjust quickly to whatever market conditions dictate. John Aschenbeck : Got it. That's very helpful. And then one more for me, really a longer-term question. In your Delaware acquisition press release, Travis, you mentioned the company had a path to reach 100,000 barrels per day in the coming years. Obviously a pretty significant jump from today's levels. So I was wondering if you could share any thoughts about how you see that happening in terms of the timelines reaching that level of production? And then also what other things we'd need to see along the way, both in terms of how many rigs need to be added per year and then also what type of commodity price environment would warrant those additional rigs? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, John, the reason that we made that comment, I made the comment specifically because I wanted to share with our investors that we now have an inventory that could support that kind of growth. The timing at which it gets there, the pace at which we get there, the ability to do it within cash flow are all dependent on how many rigs we run, what the commodity price is, and so it's in the future. And the reason I just made the comment was to be specific about we now have an inventory that can grow us to that point without getting into the specifics of when. John Aschenbeck : Got it. Very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Stevens with KeyBanc. Chris S. Stevens: Hey. Morning, guys. I have a question on the comment that you guys made regarding double-digit growth within cash flow in a $55 environment. Is the goal over the next three years to be growing double digits within cash flow, or is that really more of a comment to say that at a $50 to $55 environment, you'd be most likely ramping above that five rig number that you guys put out there? Travis D. Stice: It's really just to say that we built the company around an inventory that can support growth within cash flow. And the third leg of that commentary is that we're doing so at very high rate of return on individual projects. And so as you look forward for Diamondback in the future, we have the ability to accelerate, we've got the balance sheet to be able to do that. We've got the rock to be able to do that. And we wanted to say, again, that we've never been about growth just for growth's sake. I think our industry at times has lost sight of that, that returns really do matter. And I wanted to just make the comment that Diamondback can grow within cash flow and we can do so at a very high rate of return. Chris S. Stevens: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the weighted Howard County well results, I guess the completion design that you guys use is more of the standard design that you've used elsewhere in the Permian. Can you talk a little bit about the next set of wells, the Reed pad and whether or not you'd change anything on the actual completion design there? Michael L. Hollis: You bet, Chris. This is Mike. We are going to change several things on it. We're running micro-seismic and a tracer survey. We're going to test the high-density near-wellbore fracs. We're also going look at some diversion techniques as well as some flow rate tests. We're going to a lot of things on this so that we can see how it interacts with the wellbore in the rock in Howard County so that we can better optimize our completions in the future. Chris S. Stevens: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Merlin Tullis : Hey. Good morning. Sorry about that. I had to drop off for a couple of minutes a little earlier. Travis, do you see any potential pressure on short-term OpEx efficiencies once you begin drilling in the Delaware Basin? Or is the rig build up moderate enough so it should have little or no impact? Travis D. Stice: It should have little or no impact, Richard. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay. And then just moving on. The Viper, of course, had the recent acquisition. How are things setting up for adding additional mineral interest to the Viper portfolio, say, over the next several quarters? Michael L. Hollis: When we did the cap raise last week, I made the comment that the pipeline of inventory of opportunities has really increased and we continue to see that. And then I'll also say that after we made the announcement, the inbound activity has really picked up. And we think there's some good opportunities in front of Viper Energy Partners in upcoming quarters. Richard Merlin Tullis : And you're still willing to look outside the Permian, I guess? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, for Viper Energy Partners, we've never been geographically constrained like we've positioned Diamondback. Viper, since its inception, has looked in other Basins while Diamondback has been singularly focused on the Permian. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay. And then just lastly from me, Travis, I know you addressed this a little bit earlier about current oil gas component. But as you look our further, say, one, two years, as you drill more, say, in Glasscock County and then into the Delaware Basin, do you think the oil/gas mix could get a little gassier over time, although maybe bigger wells from the Delaware Basin? Travis D. Stice: That's possible, Richard. I'm not sure that we've got the granularity to model what our oil/gas cut's going to be in the future. I think notionally you could see an increase. But, again, we may be putting a micrometer on a brick there trying to forecast that. Richard Merlin Tullis : Sure. I understand. Well, that's all from me. And thank you. Appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Richard. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Wyatt with Stephens. Ben Wyatt : Hey. Good morning, everyone. One just quick question from me, more on the Southern Delaware and infrastructure in place. You guys mentioned, at least in the press release, when you did the acquisition you have saltwater disposal, you've got gathering in place right now. But how much can you guys ramp until you feel that the existing or planned infrastructure in place is enough? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, who at the midstream level should we be keeping our eyes on, whether it's public or private, to really monitor the pace of infrastructure development in the Southern Delaware? Travis D. Stice: Well, I won't comment on the midstream guys that are out there. There's a lot of them. You guys do a lot of research on that. But I'll tell you when we laid out a development plan that I spoke of earlier, with one rig at the end of this year and then one rig all of next year and then ramping activity to two, three and four rigs, that all has taken the infrastructure build-out and the associated requirements for stimulation fluids, et cetera, those are all taken into account. That's what we do. So we don't put a drilling schedule out there that doesn't contemplate having the adequate infrastructure in place to execute on that drilling program. Ben Wyatt : Very good. Well, Travis, I appreciate it. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Ben. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kaes Van't Hof, Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Development. Sir, you may begin. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy and Viper Energy Partners joint third quarter 2016 conference call. During our call today, we'll reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. We have also posted an updated Viper presentation, which can be found on Viper's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Kaes. Welcome everyone and thank you for listening to Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners third quarter 2016 conference call. Diamondback remains optimistic on a commodity price recovery and has continued to reaccelerate the pace of activity by adding a fifth rig in October and plans to add a sixth rig in early 2017 on our recently closed Delaware Basin acquisition and could potentially add a seventh rig in 2017, should conditions warrant. In conjunction with the rig acceleration, we have prudently added hedges to protect against lower commodity prices. We continue to expect the majority of our DUCs to be completed by the end of 2016. Our increased activity levels, combined with continued strong well performance, will enable us to grow production by more than 30%, and sets us up to continue to have multi-year organic growth at or near cash flow at current strip prices. As a reminder, we recently increased our 2016 production guidance range to 41,000 to 42,000 barrels a day, from 38,000 to 40,000 barrels a day, while keeping capital spend guidance unchanged. We have also introduced our 2017 production guidance of 52,000 to 58,000 barrels a day, which represents more than 30% production growth, as I previously mentioned. Diamondback continues to deliver on best-in-class operating expenses and we recently lowered our 2016 LOE guidance to $5.50 to $6.00 per BOE. We are pleased with the continued strength of our well results throughout our asset base, which Mike will elaborate upon later. Our organization continues to reduce DC&E costs. Third quarter 2016 cash operating costs are $9.15 per barrel, including cash G&A that is less than $1 dollar per BOE. As illustrated on slide 5, Diamondback has a track record of accretive acquisitions and continues to evaluate deals in the Permian Basin. As shown on slide 6, we have amassed a robust inventory with five core areas capable of 1 million barrel plus EURs. In each of these areas, we're focused on long lateral development, which will allow us to grow within cash flow for many years. Switching to Viper Energy Partners. Viper recently increased its distribution by 10%, representing about a 6% annualized yield as a result of increased activity and strong well results from its operators. With improving commodity prices, we have seen an increase in deal flow and continue to evaluate additional mineral acquisitions. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback continues to post encouraging results, achieve new company execution milestones. Slide 7 shows Delaware offset results that continue to improve and we now have four different zones that have successfully been tested through the drill bit. We're excited to get to work on our new Southern Delaware leasehold at the beginning of next year. Slide 8 shows two new 10,000-foot Wolfcamp B wells in Glasscock County. The Target 3905WB and 3904WB Wolfcamp B wells achieved an average 30-day flowing IP rate of 1,425 BOE per day, with an 85% oil cut. We also completed a second two-well Wolfcamp B pad with 8,000-foot laterals that averaged a 30-day flowing IP rate of 1,070 BOE per day, also with an 85% oil cut. Two of the four wells completed during the third quarter continue to flow naturally, with all four Wolfcamp B wells producing similarly to our prior Wolfcamp A wells in Glasscock County. These four Wolfcamp B wells are tracking a normalized 7,500-foot lateral type curve of 1 million BOE. Shifting to slide 9. We recently completed a three-well pad in Howard County targeting the Lower Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B. These wells had an average lateral length of 9,700 feet. The Reed Wolfcamp A achieved a two-stream 24-hour IP of 2,150 BOE per day with an 89% oil cut, and the Reed Wolfcamp B achieved a 24-hour IP of 1,800 BOE per day with a 90% oil cut. The Lower Spraberry well is currently producing 800 BOE per day with an 89% oil cut and is still cleaning up. The initial data from these wells appear stronger in the company's first three-well pad in Howard County. Early time data from the Phillips-Hodnett wells indicate after a four-month production history, they are tracking a 7,500-lateral type curve of over 1 million BOE in the Wolfcamp A, and nearly 900 MBOE each in the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp B. We believe this confirms three distinct economically productive zones on our acreage position. Turning to slide 10, Midland County Lower Spraberry results continue to outperform our 7,500-foot lateral type curve and will continue to be a core development area for years to come. On slide 11 we also highlight another area with investment-class Spraberry resource. In Martin and Andrews County, Lower Spraberry wells are tracking 1 million BOE type curves, which is comparable to our wells in Midland County. We continue to allocate capital to this core development area in 2017. Slide 13 shows Diamondback continues to drill wells at peer-leading levels in all of our operating areas. During the third quarter of 2016, we drilled three wells across the Northern Midland Basin, with an average lateral length of 10,900-foot in an average of 11.5 days each from spud to total depth. We also drilled two wells in Midland County with lateral lengths of more than 13,000 feet, our longest drill to-date. Longer laterals increase capital productivity and returns to shareholders, which is why Diamondback continues to block up acreage and drill longer laterals. Our well costs have come down roughly 47% since the peak in 2014. Leading-edge Midland Basin cost to drill, complete and equip wells remain below $6 million for a 10,000-foot lateral well and below $5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral well. Slide 15 shows reductions to our operating expenses since the peak in 2014. Looking back a year, we have reduced our LOE by 24% to $5.37 per BOE in the third quarter of 2016, due to improved pumping practices as well as service cost concessions. Illustrated another way, the first nine months of 2016 versus the first nine months of 2015, we've spent 9% less net dollars on operating costs, while producing 27% more BOE. As a result, we have reduced our LOE guidance range to $5.50 to $6.00 per BOE compared to $5.50 to $6.25 per BOE previously. Diamondback continues to maintain a rate of return focused completion optimization program. We continue to test high-density near-wellbore fracs, diversion agents, nano-surfactants, as well as dissolvable plugs. These tests are ongoing as we continue to weigh the benefits of each technique versus the additional cost. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's third quarter 2016 net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives and impairment was $42 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $102 million. Diamondback's average realized price per BOE, including hedges, for the third quarter was $34.30. During the quarter, our cash G&A costs were $0.88 per BOE, while non-cash G&A costs were $1.52. During the quarter, Diamondback spent approximately $75 million on drilling and completion, $7 million on infrastructure, and $9 million on non-operated properties. We spent an additional $701 million on acquisitions during the third quarter. This included approximately $126 million at the Viper level. In connection with our fall redetermination, Diamondback's lenders approved a $1 billion borrowing base under its credit facility, up 43% from $700 million previously. However, we again elected to limit the lenders' aggregate commitment to $500 million. With over $160 million in cash and an undrawn borrowing base with $500 million in capacity, we have ample liquidity to fund our upcoming activity. As shown on slide 17, Diamondback ended the third quarter of 2016 with a net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9 times. On slide 18, we provide our guidance for the full year 2016, as well as our preliminary guidance for 2017. In October, Diamondback increased its 2016 production guidance to a range of 41,000 to 42,000 BOE per day, up 6% from July. With strong well performance driving the increased outlook, our 2016 capital expenditure guidance was unchanged at $350 million to $425 million. As part of that update, we also introduced preliminary guidance for the full year 2017. At current strip prices, we expect to deliver annualized production growth of over 30%, at or near breakeven cash flow. I'll now turn to Viper Energy Partners, which announced on October 27 a cash distribution of $20.07 per unit for the third quarter, up 10% from the second quarter of 2016, and represents a nearly 6% annualized yield as of November 7. Operators on Spanish Trail continue to decrease the current DUC backlog. There are 14 DUCs currently on Viper's acreage, including approximately 10 wells that are normal inventory. At the end of the third quarter of 2016, Viper had $54.5 million drawn on its revolving credit facility. In October, Viper's lenders approved a $275 million borrowing base, up 57% from $175 million previously. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis for his closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another strong quarter because of our commitment to execution and low cost operations. Our production is up as a result of well performance and accelerated activity. Costs and expenses were down and we continue to break execution records. We accomplished this while maintaining our fortress balance sheet. Our financial flexibility allows us to respond quickly to prices and we remained well positioned to bring value forward across our asset base. We are pleased with the early results in Howard and Glasscock counties, increased acquisition activity at Viper, and are excited to begin development in the Southern Delaware Basin. Operator, please open the line up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first questions comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann: Morning, Travis, guys, Tracy. Nice quarter. Say, Travis, two things here. First, you mentioned about maybe perhaps bringing a seventh rig next year. Could you talk maybe just in broad terms, Travis, how you would attack? I mean, now that you've mentioned the great results in Glasscock, Howard, as well as even in Andrews, you had six to seven rigs running, how would you allocate those including the Delaware area? Travis D. Stice: Sure. So if we got to a seven-rig cadence most likely in the back half of next year, you'd have six rigs working in the Midland Basin and you'd have one rig working in the Delaware. And those six rigs would be allocated between likely one/two in Howard County, one/two in Glasscock, and one, two or three in Midland County, actually two or three in Midland County. And so, the rigs are a little fungible and one of the reasons that we pointed out that we've got five core areas that are capable of 1 million barrel type EURs is because we believe we've got lots of opportunities to deliver really nice returns to our investors. Neal D. Dingmann: And then, Travis, in Howard and \u2013 not just Howard, but none of these \u2013 many of these areas you talk about, the Wolfcamp A, B, Lower Spraberry, a number of successful intervals. As you're drilling these, are you going to \u2013 I know, kind of looking at the Delaware, you were talking about doing mostly just Wolfcamp A. If you now, with your target in the Midland next year, will you do sort of multi-stack or what do you think the focus is going to be when you look at Howard, specifically in Howard and Glasscock? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, so, Neal, that's a good question and I wish I had a definitive answer for you. I can tell you our current state of thinking is to always drill multi-well laterals. And now whether we drill those all in the A or in A/B and Lower Spraberry, it's still kind of up in the air until we get little bit more established and seasoned production on our test in Howard County. One thing we do know is that if you're looking for a clear winner on the eastern side of our acreage position, on the eastern side of the basin, it's very definitely the Wolfcamp A. And if you're looking for a clear winner on the western side of our acreage base, including what we talked about this time for the first time really in northwest Andrews and northeast \u2013 northwest Martin and northeast Andrews is going to be the Lower Spraberry. So we've really got two zones that are clearly best-in-class, and we believe that the DC&E costs that we're doing right now is probably at an all-time low. And so, we've got really nice 1 million barrel wells that we're bringing on line at an all-time low DC&E cost and we think that's going to drive our production growth next year, as well as staying within cash flow. Neal D. Dingmann: Got it. Then just lastly, you all seem to be a bit more full-cycle return driven than some other companies out there, which I like to see. I mean, when you see sort of growth for next year, is it just based on return driven? I mean, I guess the question would be, if you can add more hedges like these others, these 2x1s and lock in some of that, would that cause you to perhaps remain more active even if prices drop? Or maybe just talk about, rather than ask what you guys would do if oil goes up or down, how you think about that including the hedges. Travis D. Stice: Sure. Neal, we've always talked in times past that we believe hedges as financial engineering tools and we typically disassociate those with real-time operation decisions, because you're putting hedges on for current calendar year and you're producing these wells for another 50 years. That being said though, we believe these creative 2x1 collars that we put in place give us some protection on the downside for at least \u2013 to at least allow us to maintain some activity going forward into 2017. Even though with those hedges in place, I think we've got about 13,000 barrels hedged November-December this year and through the first half of next year. That being said though, our balance sheet, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got a fortress balance sheet. We've got cash on hand right now. So we've got the ability to continue our rate of return and NPV focused strategy on allocating capital. So, we don't mind accelerating activity into a recovery, and if we continue to see things that indicate commodity price is recovering and our industry is recovering, well, yeah, then we can continue to accelerate activity there. Just in the same vein, though, if we see price pull back to $35 a barrel or whatever, we have the ability to tap the brakes a little bit as well, too. Neal D. Dingmann: Makes sense. Thanks for the detail, Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Neal. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. John Nelson : Good morning and congrats on another strong quarter of execution. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. John Nelson : On slide 7 I think you guys incrementally showed a peer result in the second Bone Spring over in the Delaware Basin. I know you included some second Bone Spring credit in your locations when you announced the acquisition. But can you just speak to; is peer activity in the second Bone Spring making you feel any better about the potential to add more locations there? And then if you could after that just remind us the first rig that comes in the Delaware in 2017. What horizons that will target early on? Travis D. Stice: Sure. When we bought that acquisition, we underpinned it really with two zones, the Wolfcamp A \u2013 in the Wolfcamp A the third Bone Springs and the Wolfcamp B. So those are the zones that we feel like we're de-risked. We recognize that there is upside in the second Bone Springs. And I'm going to let Russell address what we found out about the second Bone Springs since the acquisition time. Specifically to your question on where that rig's going to get allocated, we'll be drilling probably five wells, first five wells we drill next year in the Delaware Basin will be focused on the Wolfcamp A. We're doing that for lease obligations. And once we've got all of those obligations satisfied, we'll switch to our more traditional development of multi-well pad, and we'll be doing these and third Bone Springs and As all at the same time probably in the back half of next year. Russell, do you want to answer the second Bone Spring question? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I mean, obviously, we're more encouraged by the results we have seen out of the second Bone. There's, obviously, a limited number of tests. Based on the analysis we did before the acquisition, we thought there was potential there. And again, we're encouraged by the results that we've seen. But as Travis was saying, our focus will really be on the Wolfcamp and the third Bone. And in one of the early wells we drill there, we'll core the intervals and based on the results of that core and early results, we'll make our decision going forward. But based on offset results in the area, we think the Wolfcamp A is probably the best zone, but we've seen some really nice results out of the third Bone and Wolfcamp B as well. John Nelson : Great. That's helpful. And then I guess just as my second question, you provided detail on the presentation about how wells are outperforming type curves. As we go into 4Q, should we be expecting any type of curve update alongside the reserve update at year end? Or do you think you'll continue to kind of gather data before potentially making any changes there? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, John, we've historically been very conservative on our type curve communication. We like to keep two sets of books, kind of a management expectation book and the Ryder Scott books. We always err on Ryder Scott books. The numbers that you hear us quote are Ryder Scott reserve numbers. We do have reviews scheduled between now and the end of the year with Ryder Scott, and I expect Russell and his team to sit down with those guys and we'll see, and we'll communicate whatever those results are when we get them wrapped up. It will probably be sometime in the first quarter. John Nelson : Perfect. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats again. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael A. Glick: Morning. Just looking at your core operating areas, your spacing assumptions do appear conservative relative to your peers. Can you talk a bit about your thought process on down-spacing and plans to test tighter spacing over the near and intermediate term? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, just in general, Michael, I'll let Russell talk specifically, but in general, we believe, just like I was talking about on our reserves, we're going to stay conservative on our reserves and we're going to stay conservative on our down-spacing. We've got over 3,000 wells left to drill in our inventory on, as you just pointed out, your opinion of conservative spacing. So if our peers and industry prove up that tighter spacing works, well, then we'll be fast followers and you'll see our inventory increase dramatically, if you believe some of the numbers that the industry is touting out there in terms of development spacing. In terms of what we're currently doing, we do have numerous tests going on. I'll let Russell talk specifically about those. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, we've done down-spacing tests in the Lower Spraberry and other zones as well. It's still early. We'll put out with Ryder Scott particularly in the Lower Spraberry, where we \u2013 just now actually have a full section of development on tighter spacing, which we think is going to be the real test. Obviously, we did some tests early on where we drilled three-well pads or two-well pads, where the early results were very encouraging. But we think you really have to look at it in a whole section development mode to see what the true results are. And I think we're getting close to having some of those results and we'll review with Ryder Scott in the next couple of months. And based on our analysis and theirs as well, we'll report what we're seeing. Michael A. Glick: Got it. And then just with five core operating areas, could you speak to about how many rigs you think that could support over longer term, and maybe where you are from a people perspective to support that level of activity? Travis D. Stice: Sure. So in general, this is just kind of a rule of thumb that we use. For every 10,000-acre block you have, we believe you can operate efficiently with two drilling rigs, and that means you can coordinate accumulation and stimulation fluids, you can coordinate simultaneous operations between drilling and fracking without getting in each other's way. So that's kind of how we've set it up. And if you look across our asset base, you can see each of those core areas. They all average somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 acres. So notionally inside those circles, you could run two rigs in each of those areas. Oh, and then the question on people, yeah. We're in pretty good shape. We always are looking to add a few key contributors. We tried to build the organization to support a 10-rig program and we're not far from that right now, but we're always looking for the best and the brightest to come join our team. If we do ramp up, you will probably see a small increase in personnel. Michael A. Glick: All right. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: I think we're at about 160 employees right now, including field operations. Michael A. Glick: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Drew E. Venker: Good morning, everyone. I was hoping, Travis, on a follow-up to Neal's question on the rig ramp. Could you talk about what your plans are, your thinking is on Delaware longer terms? So beyond 2017 how much activity you expect in the other infrastructure build and other considerations you would have on further increasing activity in the Delaware? Travis D. Stice: Sure. I'll answer your question on rig ramp, and then I will turn it to Kaes and let him talk about the infrastructure. But from a rig ramp perspective, I'll just reiterate what we talked about during the acquisition time, which is we're going to add one rig per year for the next four years. Now, one of the levers that we can control that drives differential value to our investors is by accelerating that. And if you go to my previous commentary of two rigs per 10,000 acres, we've got roughly 20,000 acres there. So we could get to four rigs sooner pretty efficiently, but we just need to get out there and start drilling. So the corporate line right now is right in line with what we talked about at acquisition, which is a one to four rig ramp over the next four years. Certainly with the results, commodity price, et cetera, we can look to accelerate that. I'll let Kaes gives us a thumbnail sketch of where we are in infrastructure out there. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. On the Delaware, when we bought the transaction, it came with 25,000 barrels a day of salt water disposable capacity, so I think we're good there for the foreseeable future. Fresh water, we're looking to build our own fresh water infrastructure throughout the majority of leasehold, and we're currently in discussions on the midstream side, both oil and gas, with the local providers to dedicate that acreage long term. Drew E. Venker: Is there any real needs on the gas processing side, or do you feel like that's handled or it's building out? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, there's significant capacity out there right now that we're going to join up with a couple of private equity-backed guys that are already out there. Drew E. Venker: Okay. And then on the well performance, it seems to be improving pretty markedly from just a quarter or two ago. Is that consistent with your perspective and if it is, can you identify any single driver that is responsible for the bulk of that improvement? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. We're always trying to optimize our results either through both landing zone and stimulation. We've talked about \u2013 Mike talked about that we've got a lot of different stimulation tests that we've done. Again, most of those are fairly early in the results. I mean, some of the results are fairly encouraging and I think if you looked at our current stimulations on average, we're probably in the 1,600 to 1,800 pound per foot range doing the high density near-wellbore fracs. With the data we've got so far, again as I said, we think those look encouraging, so we're continuing with those. But as we've mentioned, it'll be based on the returns we're getting for those incremental dollars that we're spending and we'll continue to monitor the results and make changes going forward as appropriate. Drew E. Venker: Thanks for the color. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Drew, just to add one other comment. I just want to reiterate what Russell said. We do a lot of science testing, as Russell just outlined, but I want to emphasize the point that he closed with is that, we're trying to assess what we're doing relative to the returns we get for the incremental dollar. So when you hear us talk about results from these different techniques that we're trying, we always underpin it with are we generating a greater return for our investors for the capital expended. And we hope the commentary for the industry navigates that way as well, too. So, just wanted to add that. But thanks for your questions, Drew. Drew E. Venker: Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Michael Dugan Kelly : Thanks. Good morning. Travis, there's been some concern lately from investors here that you and the other kind of Permian high fliers are growing to, or the activity is back to the point here where you're going to ultimately fill up trunk line capacity coming out of the Permian. And I know you have some opinions on that, so just was hoping to get some color there. And just if there's some concerns at Diamondback on that front, do you have the ability to go out and do some basis hedging today that might protect you? Have you thought of that? Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I'll let, Mike, I'm going to let Kaes answer that question. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, hey, Mike. We released today that we have 24,000 barrels a day of basis protection for next year, 2017, and 10,000 a day in place for 2018. I think we're looking at it two ways. We're going to protect ourselves operationally by looking at long haul capacity and meeting with some of the top guys coming out of the basin, and two, protecting us financially via those basis hedges. So we're active and we're looking at it. Michael Dugan Kelly : Okay. Do you have an idea kind of what ballpark the market is for basis in 2018 right now? Kaes Van' t Hof : It's a thinner market. We put 10,000 barrels a day on at about $0.85. I think we're happy with any number under $1 there in that market. Michael Dugan Kelly : Okay. Great. And then, Travis, going back to the Lower Spraberry and Howard, I'm just flipping through slides. I guess this is slide 9 and 10 here, and it's encouraging to hear that these first two wells here are tracking 900,000 barrel wells and above. But it does look like the profile is different versus what you are bringing on in Midland, and just we wanted to get a little bit more color on why you have the degree of confidence that these wells will actually reach that EUR level, given the just the early performance. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I'll let Russell answer it specifically, but in general term let me tell you what we're seeing in the Lower Spraberry. It does appear that it's drawing its own curve, which is atypical for most of the unconventional shales that we produce that come on at a pretty high rate, and then decline pretty quickly. The Lower Spraberry has a much slower time to peak, and the peak seems to be somewhat muted relative to what its peers are in the other shale intervals. But the decline rate is what really has surprised us. It's much, much shallower. And we've got now, as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, we've now got over four months of production history. So when Russell looks at that well, he is not just making assessment on that one well. He's also incorporating the results from all the other Lower Spraberry wells in Howard County. And Russell, do you want to add anything to that? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, I'll just say, I mean for the most part, the profile that we're seeing is fairly typical of the majority of the Lower Spraberry wells in Howard County. And we've done data trades with the other operators, so we've been able to look at their data in detail. And that's what really gives us the confidence that these are much lower decline profiles and that the EUR is going to be good. That said, I mean, we're continuing to try some things to optimize those early-time production rates. We had a micro-seismic survey that we completed on that Reed three-well pad. In the next couple of weeks we'll be getting all that data in and we'll look to see what occurred during the simulation and we'll make adjustments potentially to both the landing zone and the simulation. And we're fairly optimistic at this point that we can get decent things to get some higher initial rates, but again as we said, we're pleased with what our projected EURs are. And it is fairly early time, but we've got, offset operator data, that's probably got a year or more of production history in some cases that gives us some pretty good confidence that the EURs are going to be good. Michael Dugan Kelly : Okay. Great, guys. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond with Simmons. Your line is now open. Pearce Hammond : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. My first question pertains to service cost and, Travis, just curious what you're seeing right now in the way of any kind of service cost inflation currently. And then as you think about 2017, where do you see things maybe getting tighter? Do you see any inflation out there? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I can just tell you, Pearce, from a perspective of modeling the company's forward activity, if we model an increased commodity price, we always model an increased service cost. We think that's the most intellectual way to model the company. That being said, though, if oil stays at the $45 range like it is today, I don't think you are going to see much pressure in 2017. Look, we know our business partners, primarily on the pressure pumping side, need to start generating some profit to regenerate their aging fleets. And we need them there to be able to answer our call when activity levels do ramp up materially. So, with that being said, we just don't see a whole lot of reason on the pressure pumping side for costs to go up in 2017 if we're going to be range-bound in that $45 to $50 barrel world. Rigs, we've got plenty of drilling rigs. No worries there for the foreseeable future. And those are really the two big spend items we monitor the most closely. Pearce Hammond : Thank you. And then my follow-up pertains to the acquisition environment within the Permian. Just real high level, how do you see it right now? Are there still plenty of deals out there? Do you think valuations maybe need to come down a little bit? But even just some color between the Delaware and the Midland, if you could provide it. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Pearce, we've got a pretty consistent record of not talking about transactions that are underway. But I can give you some of my high-level thoughts. If you go back to our ops update, I made the comment that we're only going to do transactions that generate exceptional returns to our investors. I think you can always hold me accountable for that statement. There is still \u2013 on the Midland Basin side, we see smaller size trades that are occurring. That, one, are allowing us to block up and drill longer laterals, whether they're outright acquisitions or swaps. And there's a few smaller packages that are out in the marketplace right now that I know haven't garnered a lot of interest. On the Delaware Basin side, just the saturation of private equity companies that are out there that are all trying to take advantage of the marketplace right now, there's just whole bunch of opportunities there in the Delaware. And I don't know if there is buyer fatigue or not yet in the Delaware, but I can tell you that I don't think all 15 or 20 of the private equity-based companies out there are going to go public in the next 12 months. So they're all looking for some form of liquidity event for their investors. So, like I said in my prepared remarks, Diamondback is in that game. We continue to look for ways to generate exceptional returns to our investors. Pearce Hammond : Thanks, Travis, and congrats on a solid quarter. Travis D. Stice: You bet, Pearce. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff S. Grampp: Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the enhanced completions that you guys kind of talked about. Can you give us a sense for what kind of the dataset is internally with Diamondback wells as far as kind of the well history and the aggregate dataset and kind of what you're all \u2013 obviously, the encouraging results in Howard and some of the other areas, but just kind of wanted to get a greater sense of what the ultimate dataset is internally within Diamondback for those types of wells. Michael L. Hollis: Jeff, this is Mike. We've been doing testing since we started fracking wells out here in 2012 in these horizontals. So, it's a pretty extensive test group and we've changed a lot of things over time. The most recent high-density near-wellbore diversion techniques, that subset group, again, in multiple counties and multiple zones. But roughly 12 to 15 wells very early in the production history of those wells. But we've tested them in areas where we have existing wells that were completed with the older techniques and styles, and we'll come in and do some of these new techniques. We've also tested these in areas where we have no wells that were completed. So we've got a subset of data that's going to be coming to us over the next several quarters that we ought to be able to help diagnose what some of the better techniques to do going forward. Now, what we can pretty well tell you is they're going to be different in each area, so there won't be any cookie cutter answer for anything. But, in general, we're looking at that 1,600 to 2,000 pound per foot sand concentrations and the more high-density near-wellbore completions. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. Thanks for that, Mike. And then on the longer laterals, looking at \u2013 I guess it's slide 12, it looks like you guys are keeping the EUR per foot constant across the various lateral lengths and you guys talked about drilling some even 13,000 footers. Is that holding pretty consistent in terms of not seeing any EUR degradation as you stretch the laterals out? Russell Pantermuehl : I'll tell you the data we've seen so far is pretty encouraging. The one thing, when you get to real long laterals, particularly in the high productivity zones, sometimes you might be limited early-on on how much total fluid you can move. So you might not \u2013 in the first few months, you're probably not seeing quite as high of peak rates on the longer laterals, but the data that we've seen so far, both our data and other data that we traded for, seems to indicate that it's pretty close to a one-to-one relationship with lateral lengths. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay, great. Appreciate the detail. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to, I guess, talk a little bit about the comment you made regarding Lower Spraberry and Andrews and Martin County being competitive with Midland. But then in response to a question around rig allocation, and I don't believe you mentioned allocating a rig to that area in 2017. Did I hear that right? And number two, can you just kind of talk through what would get you more interested in putting rigs in that area? Russell Pantermuehl : Yes. So what I tried to indicate was that northeast Andrews and northwest Martin County could accommodate about two rigs, because of the 10,000 to 15,000 acre spot. So it's really two there, two in Andrew and two in \u2013 one/two in Howard, one/two in Glasscock, and two/three in Midland County and one in the Delaware. So I also pointed out that we've got \u2013 it's somewhat fungible, because we've got such high rate of return wells in each of those areas. The actual decision to allocate capital is a little complicated, because all the wells are so equal in performance. So we're not at all scared to allocate capital in northeast Andrews and northwest Martin County. We believe that it's a really great area for us. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. So it sounds like that area will get some capital in 2017 then? Russell Pantermuehl : Again, in terms of also, Michael, we sort of took a pause on that earlier this year when commodity prices got really low, because most of that acreage is either held or only has a one well per year commitment. So it looks like our activity was somewhat muted there. But it was really just when we got down to three rigs, thinking we were going to go to one, that we stopped development in that area because, quite honestly, we didn't have to allocate capital at that time. Michael Anthony Hall : Got it. That's helpful, understood. And then in the context of those five operating areas, the southern Midland didn't get a call out. I'm just curious how that's sitting in the portfolio today and kind of what's needed to keep that acreage whole? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. We've got it mostly held by production. It's down in Upton County and it's what we call our price-dependent inventory and we probably need $55, $60 a barrel at today's D&C cost to be competitive with the rest of our capital allocation. Certainly, if we got up to that eight to ten-rig cadence, that would imply a commodity price that would generate probably one rig, if not full-time, at least part-time down there in that area. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to zero in on the Wolfcamp B in Howard County. Did you look at pressure drawdown between that and A? Is there material difference in the two intervals? And the early \u2013 the first well versus the second well, maybe talk a little bit about the comment that the second is outperforming. What's leading you to believe that this early on? Just some more commentary around that. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. I mean, if you compare the Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, if you look at the IPs we reported for the Reed wells this time and for the Hodnett well the last time, there is not much difference in 30-ay IP between the A and the B. But the B, pressure draws down little quicker, little bit steeper decline and that's why we think long-term the Wolfcamp A will be the better zone. And then on the question comparing the second pad to the first pad, again, it's fairly early. The rates aren't that much different, but the pressure is holding in quite a bit better on the Reed well than it did on the Hodnett well. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. Russell Pantermuehl : Whether that's due to the high-density near-wellbore frac on the Reed well or whether it's just a geologic difference, we don't know yet. But so far \u2013 and again, it's very early. We probably have three weeks of total production on these wells. At least very early on, the Reed Wolfcamp B does appear to be outperforming the Hodnett Wolfcamp B, though. Michael Anthony Hall : Got it. And the last one on my end was, just going over to the Southern Delaware Basin. I believe you all have about a 50% working interest in that area, if I recall. Any thoughts on \u2013 just kind of update if you have any line of sight on potentially increasing that working interest and kind of blocking up or cleaning up some of that acreage at this stage? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, I mean there's really three things going on there. One is we're working on some acreage trades that won't increase our total net acreage, but it will increase our working interest in the wells we drill. And I'll tell you, we've been pretty encouraged by the amount of activity we've got so far and willing offset operators. And the other piece is, we continue to pick up additional acreage in that area as well, so increase our total net acreage in the area. So right now we're fairly encouraged by the success we've had on both of those fronts. Michael Anthony Hall : What's your current gross on that? Do you have that by chance? Russell Pantermuehl : I don't have that. That number would be, think of it, can say it has increased since the initial acquisition. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. I'll follow-up. Actually one more if I could squeeze it in. Just curious, you guys have in the past talked about 100,000 barrel a day capacity from the asset. As we firmed up 2017 a bit more here, I'm just wondering if you have any more, I guess, views on as to how quickly you can get to that level. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Michael, we stretched by providing 2017 guidance as early as we did. Certainly to talk about 2018 or 2019, I think, is way premature at this point. Michael Anthony Hall : All right. I figured I'd give it a shot. Appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Good effort. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Looking at the slide deck, about 70% of your inventory is around 5,000-foot laterals. What percentage of that inventory do you think you can increase the lateral length via acreage drops? And then what percentage of that inventory do you think is just going to always be kind of a shorter lateral? Russell Pantermuehl : I think it's probably about at least 30% of those would probably end up being shorter laterals and a lot of those, I will say, are Spanish Trail, Lower Spraberry, where just due to the acreage configuration and some of the surface issues in the area, we'll probably always be limited to 5,000-foot laterals. A lot of the rest of it is acreage that we think we'll eventually be able to block up either through drilling joint wells with other operators or making acreage trades. But we've still got those in our inventory of short laterals, because we haven't actually inked any of those deals yet, but we continue to work on it. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then just turning over to Glasscock County, of the four wells that were turned on line, two of those wells are flowing naturally, and actually they're each flowing on separate pads flowing naturally with the other one on E&P. Can you talk about what you are seeing over there? Did you complete those differently? Were they in a different landing zone? And then do you think Glasscock in general might have more wells flowing naturally versus the rest of your Midland Basin acreage? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, I think Glasscock, it is a little hard EUR area, so they \u2013 most of the wells do flow naturally for some period of time. It varies from well to well. Maybe it's a month. Maybe as long as three or four or five months depending on the well. There were some slight differences in landing zones on those pads, and so that may be contributing to the reason that one flows longer than the other. But I'll say when you actually look at the data between the two zones, I mean, there's very slight differences. The difference in flowing pressure probably doesn't differ by more than 100 psi between the wells, so it's not significant. And you just have one surface production upset can cause a well to stop flowing, and at that point we'll go ahead and run the ESP. So probably not as much difference as you might be thinking from just looking at the data at a high level. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Jason A. Wangler: Hi. Travis, just curious, you talked about service pricing and things. How is it looking as far as just equipment availability? You kind of mentioned obviously, they are not really replacing things right now. And obviously, activity for you guys and everybody else is increasing. How are you seeing that kind of side of it, looking as you guys continue to kind of pick up more and more over the next couple years? Michael L. Hollis: Hey, Jason. This Mike Hollis. I'll take this one for you. Kind of as we've mentioned in the past, as long as the Permian Basin is pretty much the only bellwether right now, adding any activity short of the SCOOP and STACK area, availability of iron typically isn't a problem right now. Very short term, if you called something out tomorrow may be a difficult thing. But if you've got a week, a week or two getting iron and people usually isn't an issue. We see that coming more later in the second half of 2017 or in 2018 when some of the other basins pick back up and we're all competing for the same services at that point. But for right now, service, equipment, and people are easily accessible. Jason A. Wangler: Yeah, thanks, Mike. And I mean, the old rule of thumb is they all, everything has wheels on it, so is it mostly bringing things into the Permian, as you said, being the bellwether from other areas? Because I would assume that there's not a lot of new equipment, so it's mostly bringing in people and equipment from the basins that were more active historically. Is that fair? Michael L. Hollis: That's correct. Yes sir. We still see trucks coming into the basin every day. Jason A. Wangler: Okay, great. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it back. Michael L. Hollis: Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple quick questions. Travis, FANG has done a real good job lowering cash OpEx over the past year or two, or even going beyond that. What's the outlook for 2017, given startup of drilling in Southern Delaware Basin? Any capacity to lower further at that point? Travis D. Stice: We gave \u2013 did we give guidance for 2017 OpEx? So, we haven't done it yet. But I think LOEs is one of those things that we always continue to push on, regardless of what commodity price is. And I think Mike did a good job of laying out in his prepared remarks that his organization is working on not only the absolute dollars in the numerator, but we're also adding volumes in the denominator, which makes that ratio look really good. The LOE costs, Richard, are typically a little bit more sticky than what you see on those service cost, DC&E side. Your large spend areas, electricity, chemicals, water disposal, manpower, those type of things that are at the top of your LOE statement usually don't have much movement to it. So, we believe that we're sort of \u2013 it might move down slightly, but we're sort of at that asymptotic portion of that cost reduction, and we'll see. But our corporate culture is to always push on LOE until we can produce these wells for free. So we're always going to try to push on that envelope. Richard Merlin Tullis : And then if you guys decided to add that seventh rig next year, where would that rig be placed? Sorry if I missed that if you already went over it. Travis D. Stice: No worries. It will be in the Midland Basin side, and it kind of follows some of that two per 10,000 acre metrics that I laid out. So you'd have, if you were with a seven rig cage, you'd have six in the Midland Basin and one in the Delaware. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay. And then just lastly, obviously great production growth in the third quarter with 32% quarter-over-quarter growth. What was the exit rate for the quarter, if you are able to say that, Travis? Travis D. Stice: I don't think we release that information. Exit rates for the quarter, Richard, with as much activity as we've got going on, the reason we don't provide annual guidance is because, I mean, quarterly guidance is because any given quarter if we've got a frac crew in one of our high producing areas, we could be watered \u2013 we could have watered out or shut-in 5,000-plus, 5,000 to 8,000 barrels a day of production shut-in. So I don't pay much attention to quarterly exits. It's probably reasonable to ask me what I exit the year at when we get there. But quarterly exit, I quite honestly couldn't even tell you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Richard, I mean page 5 of our deck that we released will give you a pretty good idea without giving you the exact number. Richard Merlin Tullis : All right. Good enough. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sam Burwell with Canaccord. Your line is now open. George Herrison Burwell : Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the Spraberry and Andrews and Martin. Looking at slide 11, you lay out the production history of the wells; most of them look to be kind of older vintage, like at least a year online. So, I was wondering if it was safe to assume that most, if not all, of these were completed with an older, smaller frac design. And when you guys go back up there, probably with a newer, larger one, do you expect a meaningful uplift from what we see here? Travis D. Stice: Sam, you might have heard me talk about this before, but when this executive team came together, we brought with us multiple decades of developing unconventional resources horizontally, from the Montana, Bakken, to North Dakota Middle Member to the Barnett Shale, the Marcellus and Utica. And what we brought with us was a bench strength of completion expertise on horizontal wells. So the first well that we fracked in 2012 was with 1,500 pounds of sand per foot, slick water at 100 barrels a minute. And we've only made slight tweaks to that, as Mike outlined, over the time. So, when you ask me about what we're going to do with these new completions in northeast Andrews and northwest Martin, the most likely thing we'll do is modify them to the high-density near-wellbore. But you're not going to see \u2013 you just don't see \u2013 we started with whatever the buzzword is, Gen 5 or Gen 3, that's really where we started in 2012. George Herrison Burwell : Okay. Got it. Appreciate the color. And then just one quick follow-up in this area. Do you guys plan to test any Middle Spraberry or Jo Mill wells? It looks like, just eyeballing this, all these were Lower Spraberry. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, I think there's a reasonable chance we do a Middle Spraberry test in 2017. I know there's lot of offset operators, or quite a few offset operators that have drilled Middle Spraberry in the area, and several of those wells are probably within a mile of our acreage. And the results have been very encouraging. So, we're pretty certain we have Middle Spraberry potential on our acreage. Again, the IPs on the Middle Spraberry haven't been as good as the Lower Spraberry, but the EURs still look good. So we'll probably test it at some point, but with all the offset activity we've got in the area, we feel like the zone is proved up on our acreage, and so there's not a real need for us to step out and test it any time soon while we're seeing the really good results from the Lower Spraberry. George Herrison Burwell : Okay. Makes sense. That's all I got. Thanks, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Sam. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Thank you. Folks, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up on the enhanced completions. Has the efficient frontier been reached yet in the Permian Basin with, say, 2,000 pounds per foot, or will greater sand loadings be tested? And how do those sand loadings differ by zone or by area, meaning is more or less in any one zone because of the unique rock characteristics involved? Michael L. Hollis: Dan, this is Mike. I'll take that. The answer to every one of those questions is basically yes. We don't think that we found the efficient frontier just yet. You have seen some folks really push the edge and have pulled back, in that 1,800 to 2,000 pounds seems to be about the right number. Everyone that's gone a little farther have come back just from look \u2013 once they start looking at the rate of return driven economics of what they are spending and what they are getting. Now each one of the zones will be different and each one of the counties will be slightly different. So to give a blanket answer as to what it is, it's really difficult to do that right now. But as we go forward, we are moving more towards those high-density near-wellbore fracs, diversions where appreciate, diversion agents. One of the things we're also seeing is we're migrating to more of a stack and staggered approach to a lot of these zones to give ourselves a little bit more distance within the same number of wells per section we get a little bit more physical distance away from the wellbores. And as we do these high-density near-wellbore fracs, we're trying to condense the amount of rock that we are touching. So, over time, yes, we have gone to a higher sand loading, but we've also gone to lower rates at which we're pumping. So we're not getting out and touching as much rock and we're trying to get a higher recovery factor from the rock that we are touching near-wellbore. So a lot of knobs are being turned now, but to say that we've hit that final frontier here in the Midland Basin it's hard to say. We're a little bit further along than over in the Delaware, where you are still seeing large differences from the changes that these folks are making. Again, they also started from a much different starting point with a very low sand concentrations, more hybrid fracs and gel loaded fracs. So you are seeing a lot of changes in the Delaware, more so than the Midland side. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Got it. Helpful. Thank you, and have a great day. Michael L. Hollis: You, too. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Dan. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Rezvan from Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Timothy Rezvan : Hi. Good morning, folks. Most of my questions have been answered. I had a quick one. I guess we haven't talked about Viper much. Your debt was relatively unchanged it looks like in the third quarter, but you increased your borrowing base by $100 million. Should we read into that \u2013 I mean, I guess, if you could repeat your kind of broad outlook, you talked about M&A and kind of what, if anything, you've seen on the mineral side? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Tim. This is Kaes here. We've seen a lot more activity on the M&A front for Viper kind of starting at the end of Q2 into Q3 with the $126 million of acquisitions we did in the quarter. Most of that funded via the equity deal we did in July. Borrowing base is raised, and I think we continue to use that borrowing base as a way to fund acquisitions, bundle up a few and then go out to the market. I think we want to keep the same low leverage mentality at Viper we've kept at Diamondback, and simply do deals that are accretive to that distribution. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. So it's safe to say you are seeing, maybe didn't ask, maybe starting to converge a little more? Kaes Van' t Hof : Correct. Correct. I think we've done $300 million of total deals in two years and $126 million of them were in one quarter. So I think that trend should continue based on what we're seeing. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to there Mr. Travis Stice for any closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you had any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise but later, we'll be holding a question-and-answer session after the prepared remarks and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Manager, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we'll make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, Viper Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Diamondback, will be hosting its first standalone conference call at 10 :00 a.m. Central today. Dial-in details can be found on Viper's earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. 2016 was a transformational year for Diamondback, with two halves of the year that could not have been more different. We reacted appropriately to the unprecedented decline in commodity price in the first half of the year by deferring completion activity and subsequently responded quickly with increased activity and asset acquisitions in the second half of the year. We are working diligently to close the second acquisition, a $2.4 billion purchase of the assets of Brigham Resources. Upon the closing of this acquisition at the end of this month, Diamondback will have more than doubled our Tier 1 acreage and added our sixth and largest core operating area of 1 million barrel EUR wells. Our confidence in the resource potential of this asset is based on more than 50 producing horizontal wells positioned across the acreage. The Wolfcamp A will receive the majority of our capital in the near term, but there remains substantial upside in multiple other zones with several years of inventory ahead of us. We will complete this transaction at an acreage value that allows Diamondback to achieve full cycle returns that continue to be industry-leading. We expect the deal to be immediately accretive on all financial metrics as well as to our corporate wide oil cut. As a result of this acquisition, we will have the inventory to grow at industry-leading rates within cash flow for multiple years, and our focus now concentrates on resource execution, converting rock into cash flow most efficiently. The contiguous nature of the overall acreage position fits with our focus on operational efficiency, and we expect to achieve the same best-in-class drilling and completion results in the Delaware Basin that we are known for in the Midland Basin. From an operational standpoint, we are operating six rigs today; five in the Midland Basin and one in the Southern Delaware Basin. We expect to add two rigs to the Brigham position after closing. Diamondback continues to proactively manage service cost inflation. We could potentially increase our operated rig count to ten rigs in the back half of the year should commodity prices continue to strengthen. As a result, we are increasing our 2017 production guidance, a range which implies over 65% production growth at the midpoint and positions us to continue to have multi-year organic growth at or near cash flow breakeven prices at current strip. Q4 2016 production of nearly 52,000 barrels a day was up 16% quarter-over-quarter and 38% year-over-year. Average daily production for 2016 was 43,000 barrels a day, which exceeded the high-end of our range of 41,000 to 42,000 barrels a day and is up 30% year-over-year. 2016 proved reserves increased over 30% from 2015 to more than 205 million barrels, 68% of which are oil. I am particularly proud of our proved developed finding and development costs of $7.26 per barrel. Diamondback continues to deliver on its corporate mission of best-in-class execution and low cost operations with cash operating costs decreasing 7% quarter-over-quarter to less than $8.50 a barrel, including LOE below $5 a barrel and cash G&A less than $1.00 a barrel. Our 2017 LOE guidance at the midpoint is 9% of our 2016 guided range. We continue to be pleased with the strength of our well results throughout our asset base, which Mike will elaborate upon later. As shown on slide 4, we have accumulated a strong inventory with six core areas with wells capable of 1 million barrel-plus EURs. In each of these areas, we are focused on long lateral development with more than 80% of our locations having 7,500 foot or longer laterals. We have now built a legacy company with an asset base that we expect will, at current strip prices, allow us to grow at best-in-class rates within cash flow for many years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback continues to post encouraging results and achieve new company execution milestones. Turning to slide 5, Diamondback continues to increase our conservatively booked oil weighted reserves. 2016 reserves increased 31% to 205 million BOE, replacing 409% of production, 380% of which was organic. Showcasing our conservative approach to booking, 58% of our reserves booked are proved developed with only 2% of those reserves attributed to the Delaware Basin. This illustrates the tremendous reserve growth that Diamondback has in front of us. We have continued to demonstrate our peer-leading capital efficiency with drill bit F&D at $6.31 per BOE and PDP F&D at $7.26 per BOE. Slide 7 shows our continued success in Howard County, where we believe we had demonstrated economic results across three zones and plan to run one rig continuously in the area. As you can see, the well results on our second operated pad, the Reed pad, have well-exceeded the performance of our first. Diamondback continues to maintain a rate of return-focused completion optimization program. On the Reed pad, we optimized well placement within the reservoir and utilized a stack and staggered approach while monitoring with microseismic. We also applied high-density near-wellbore stimulations, including the use of diverting agents. After producing over 100,000 BOE in 125 days, the Reed Lower Spraberry well continues to produce over 1,100 barrels a day, of which 89% is oil. Slide 8 also illustrates the top quartile inventory we possess in Glasscock County. The Ray wells have shown impressive results; getting confidence these wells will exceed an average of a 1 million barrel type curve. After producing roughly 85,000 BOE each in 80 days, the Ray WA wells, Wolfcamp A wells, continue to produce over 1,400 BOE a day each. We've also completed our second and third Lower Spraberry wells and with these encouraging results, we plan to run one rig continuously in Glasscock County through 2017. On slide 9, we provide an update on the continued success of our under-appreciated 1 million barrel type curve Lower Spraberry well results in Andrews and northern Martin counties where again we intend to stay active in 2017. Our plan is to run two to three rigs in Midland County in 2017 where we continue to have exceptional results, and well economics are further supported by Viper's ownership in minerals. Our optimized stimulation has become our standard design for the four proven zones in Midland County. Slides 11 through 15 describe our plans and recent activity on or near our current Southern Delaware Basin assets. We commenced drilling operations on this asset in January and will focus a majority of our 2017 drilling activity in the Wolfcamp A. Since the time of the acquisition, we have increased our working interest from 49% to 73% thanks to trades in bolt-on acquisitions. Our Brigham acquisition is still expected to close at the end of this month, and we plan to complete five DUCs and operate two rigs post-close. Our Southern Delaware asset provides a large runway for future growth as our asset base could allow for up to 10 operated rigs in the future. Turning to operations and execution, slide 17 demonstrates our continued track record of execution as DC&E costs are down 41% from 2014, while our average completed lateral length is up about 30%. We have forecasted service cost inflation in our 2017 CapEx budget, primarily from completions. We are proactively mitigating these costs where appropriate. For instance, we are de-bundling services and have a large percentage of tubular goods forward purchased. Slide 19 reflects our spacing assumptions relative to our peers, leaving considerable upside from downspacing potential. 86% of our pro forma locations have a lateral length of 7,500 feet or longer. Diamondback has been successful at bolting on and trading to block up acreage. Longer laterals are more capital efficient and provide a higher rate of return for our shareholders. Slide 20 shows reductions to our operating expenses since the peak in 2014. Total LOE spend for 2016 was essentially flat with 2015, despite production increasing 30% over the same period. Fourth quarter LOE was $4.89 per BOE. We've recently reduced our 2017 LOE guidance range to $4.75 to $5.75 per BOE compared to $5.50 to $6 per BOE in 2016. And that's due to improved pumping practices, lower well failure rates, and increased horizontal production. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's fourth quarter 2016 net income was $26 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Our net income adjusted for noncash derivatives, and the premium paid for early refinancing of our senior notes was $72 million or $0.90 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $138 million, up 35% from Q3 2016. Diamondback's average realized price per BOE, including hedges for the fourth quarter of 2016, was $38.09. During the quarter, our cash G&A costs were $0.92 per BOE while non-cash G&A was $1.22. During the quarter, Diamondback spent approximately $104 million on drilling and completions, $10 million on infrastructure, and $8 million on non-operated property. We spent an additional $87 million on acquisitions during the fourth quarter, including approximately $68 million at the Viper level. As shown on slide 23, pro forma for our pending Brigham acquisition, Diamondback ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with a net debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times. On slide 25, we provide our guidance for the full year 2017. Diamondback increased its 2017 production guidance to a range of 69,000 to 76,000 BOE per day, up 6% from December 2016 guidance. With strong well performance, higher working interest, and increased activities driving the increased outlook, our 2017 capital expenditure guidance has also increased slightly to between $800 million and $1 billion. We are reflecting some service cost inflation and a six-to-ten rig program with 130 wells to 165 wells completed, assuming an average lateral length of 8,500 feet. At current strip prices, we expect to deliver annualized production growth of over 65% at or near breakeven cash flow. We will also be spending $75 million on one-time infrastructure projects in the Delaware Basin, investments which on a standalone basis, have returns that rival our operated wells while maintaining best-in-class operating margins. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another strong quarter because of our commitment to execution and low-cost operations. Our production and reserves were up as a result of well performance and accelerated activity. Cost and expenses were down. And we continue to break execution records. After more than doubling our Tier 1 acreage with our announced acquisitions in the second half of 2016, our focus now shifts to execution. And we think we have an established track record of executing that will aid us as we continue development in the Southern Delaware Basin. Andrew, please open the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer queue is now open. We'll be taking our first question from the line of John Nelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations to the team on a really outstanding quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, John. John Nelson : Travis, we're adding a lot of Permian rigs here each week, and a lot of investors obviously focused on oilfield service cost inflation. The team mentioned a lot of times in their prepared remarks you're baking in some level of service cost inflation at 2017 budget. Wondering if we can get any further quantification of what that is that's baked in. And then maybe you could also tie that in with what are you guys actually seeing in real time, have we really seen the pressures start to build yet? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, that's a good question, John. Just mathematically, we've dialed in between a 10% and 15% total well cost increase starting in the first quarter. We're not seeing that just yet. We actually believe that if oil stays kind of range bound between $50 and $55, the impetus behind service cost increases will be muted a little bit. However, if we continue to see commodity prices strengthen to that $55 to $60 a barrel, we believe that you'll see these service cost increases start to accelerate in the back half of this year. Now it's not that Diamondback is going to acquiesce on these cost increases. We're working diligently with our service providers and our business partners, like Mike had highlighted, to try to mitigate those costs. We know that for a healthy industry as we continue to build rigs in the Permian, we are going to have to have a service company that's well-capitalized and ready to support increased activity. I think last week here in the Permian, we eclipsed 300 rigs and we're adding anywhere between five rigs and ten rigs per week. And so if that pace continues, you'll start to see some tightening. So, we've not just opened our eyes to this phenomenon this quarter; it's something we've been doing really since the back half of last year when all activity increased. And while we may not be insulated from all service cost increases, we feel like we've been proactive enough to be able to offset some of the service cost increases that we're forecasting. So really, 10% to 15% on the total well cost, the drilling side, we're not anticipating really much if any increase on the drilling side. All of that increase is really housed on the completion side, primarily under pressure pumping, which means we've dialed in a 20% to 25% increase. Again, we're not seeing that today, but we are having conversations with our business partners that if activity continues to pick up and demand for those services continues to increase, to expect cost increases. John Nelson : That's really, really helpful. My second question may be a little bit more higher level. It sounds like there's a little bit of inflection in your messaging here and that Diamondback is going into cash flow harvest mode, so to speak, post Brigham. If I take a step back, you team's done a really \u2013 has an excellent track record of executing accretive bolt-on acquisitions. And as I think about the year ahead, it would seem to us at least that 2017 could be a year where smaller players learn they maybe can't operate as efficiently as Diamondback as service capacity tightens, potentially compelling them to the negotiating table. So I guess my question is just to be clear on the messaging. Is it, a) Diamondback has the scale and we're just in digestion mode for the time being? Or is it, b) Diamondback has the scale, but will continue to look at every deal that's in the market should there potentially be more over the course of 2017? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, good question, John, and let me get to that. I just want to close the other comment on the service cost increases. We've spent a lot of the last two quarters talking about savings that we had made permanent inside Diamondback Energy. So with the efficiency gains and the things that we've done institutionally and organizationally in-house, we believe that that also further insulates us from future cost increases. So, we've talked about as much as half of the total savings which are down about 50% from the peak in 2014 being made permanent through efficiency gains. So, we know that there's going to be some leverage and some cost increase on the other side of the table, as I pointed out, that's needed, but don't forget that Diamondback has really led the way in pushing these savings and efficiency gains to make things permanent. If you read our press release, we've got a couple of comments in there about how long it takes us to drill one of these wells. That a couple of years ago was taking us \u2013 we were drilling about a 1,000 feet a day, and now we're drilling over 2,000 feet a day. And those savings are going to be with our shareholders from now on. Now specific to your question on acquisitions, yeah, it's not reasonable to think that Diamondback is going to move firmly into just digestion mode. What I said is that from a resource capture side of things, we're very comfortable with our inventory, and it's now all about resource execution. That being said though, we're going to continue to do the bolt-on acquisitions, the smaller trades that are in the $100 million to $300 million range; it depends, maybe larger. But again, with our enterprise value of over $11 million, almost $12 million right now, it takes something really big to move the needle. So what I intimated was that the large trades in terms of really building our resource are probably on the sidelines for now. But what we're really focused on is every quarter, doing these bolt-on acquisitions that allows us to, like you pointed out, be more efficient than the seller and also drill longer lateral or perhaps have addressed the service shortage potential more adequately than the seller. So, we're still in the game. I've said all along that you're either in the game or out of the game, and we're still in the game. John Nelson : Great. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats again. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pearce Hammond from Simmons. Your line is open. Pearce Hammond : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Travis, just following up on the question just now on service costs. If they did accelerate maybe faster than what you're anticipating, would you consider building DUCs? Travis D. Stice: If you look at the returns that we have on these wells with those permanent savings that I just got through talking about, I don't think that's reasonable. I think you'd have to see a combination of rapidly increasing service costs coupled with a declining commodity price. I think that's the only time we'd really start having that conversation again. You've heard me talk about dead capital or stranded capital. That's not a good thing for our investors, and that's what DUCs are. They're least deferred capital. And so as long as the industry moves sort of in lock step with an increasing commodity price, I don't think it's reasonable for us to start building our DUCs again. Pearce Hammond : Great. And then, Travis, my follow up is how comfortable are you right now with your current Delaware Basin water sourcing and infrastructure for dealing with produced water? Travis D. Stice: Look, Pearce, we take over operations here in a couple of weeks, but we've got a full in-house team dedicated to looking at these issues, not in a micro sense but in a macro sense so that we can address all of those issues with the multi-rig drilling program. And I'll give a shout-out to the Brigham Resources operations team. They've been dealing with that issue for years and they have been excellent to work with and bringing my guys up to speed, and so it's something that we're very proactive at. We've got a water sourcing team now that focuses on nothing but accumulation and disposal of water. And while that will be a portion of the infrastructure spend that we've talked about this year, we anticipate doing what we do, which is to get in front of that and be able to feed the multi-rig program we're talking about. Pearce Hammond : Thanks, Travis, and congrats on a great 2016. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Pearce. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, Travis. Travis, one of my question is, a little bit on John, on overall spend. I know you haven't \u2013 I'm certainly not going to hold you to any type as far out as 2018 yet, but you mentioned about spending $75 million on the Delaware infrastructure, and then when I sort of looking at the upstream activity, I guess what I'm looking at as far as how much spend in 2018 do you see could be a bit different than 2017 in terms of not needing as much infrastructure, and then perhaps having more delineation or developmental type drilling? So I guess getting more bang for your buck, if you will, next year, if you comment on that? Travis D. Stice: Yes, Neal, we certainly see value proposition on the midstream side of things. And as we pointed out in our prepared comments, there's about I think $75 million of what we refer to as more one-time spending as we get in front of some of the things we need to do to produce this rock very efficiently. And as you move into 2018, you're right, we've not provided any guidance on 2018, but it's reasonable to expect that we will return more to traditional spend levels on the infrastructure side of things in 2018. And then also on the delineation, we talk about that a lot internally, how much delineation do you want to do in 2017, how much do you want to do in the future. And every time we have that conversation, we always end up back to the point that let's drill the highest rate of return wells first. And like I talked about in my prepared comments, we've got a bunch of really, really attractive Wolfcamp A wells in our future. And there will be some cases where for lease provisions and other requirements that we have to drill in other zones, but I think the vast majority of our CapEx over the next several years will be focused on drilling our highest rate of return wells. The think the only thing that would change that is that if through our own selected testing or offset industry data finds a zone that actually generates a higher rate of return, then we'll continue to just focus on Wolfcamp A. Neal D. Dingmann: And, Travis, that comment right there was going to lead to my second question, as far as you were going to add a rig obviously down at the Brigham area once you take that over. Are there things that could change the drilling plans for the end of the year as terms of \u2013 or the allocation of rigs based on the returns, or would that be more of an 2018 event with 2017 being pretty well set? Travis D. Stice: Again, we're not providing a lot of color for 2018, but I've made a comment that we can get up to 10 rigs, and I think if that's the case, you're going to have five or six in the Midland Basin side and five or six on the Delaware Basin side. So we believe that the returns to our shareholders are about equivalent on either side of the basin based on the wells that we're drilling. So we intend, as a go-forward basis, to have equal allocation across both basins. As a matter fact, organizationally, we're trying to separate the organization out into more of a Delaware-focused organization and a Midland Basin organization. And each will compete for allocation dollars. Neal D. Dingmann: Great. Great. Thanks, Travis, for the details. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew E. Venker: Hi, everyone. Travis I was hoping you could just go back to the comment you made in your prepared remarks about growing at peer-leading rates within cash flow. I think it is somewhat of a different path than what you guys have followed historically. Can you talk about what has changed the appetite to spend? And I guess how that might change at higher prices? Travis D. Stice: Well, I think the right way to think about our spending is to \u2013 as prices increase, we generate free cash flow. I think it's reasonable to increase drilling activity and we'll pick another rig up, and we'll use that cash flow appropriately that way in drilling wells. And then it's also important to remind everyone that part of our genetic code, part of our DNA is to always remain opportunistic in acquisitions, big or small. In fact, if you just want to look at our balance sheet, I think that gives you an idea of how we maintain that flexibility. So the world of outspending cash flow and levering up your balance sheet is just \u2013 if 2014, 2015 proved anything to the industry yet again it's that you better take care of your balance sheet or you're going to lose control of the things that you want to control to develop your assets. So we're just going to be very conservative as we go forward in the future on what we do to the balance sheet, but we'll remain opportunistic. Drew E. Venker: Thanks for that, Travis. And following up on your comments on M&A, obviously, we continue to expect you to be in the marketplace. But is there much that you see out there today that looks attractive or that would fit naturally with your existing asset base? Travis D. Stice: Like I said, on the bolt-on stuff, there's little smaller deals, we continue to have very active conversations on ways to do that that allows us to apply our efficiencies in a more meaningful way, bolt-ons, smaller trades. I think in terms of the big deals, I think we're probably on the backside of that curve, but I'm not aware of every deal that's out there. We know that we were very active over the last 18 months, both as Diamondback and as an industry, particularly in the Delaware Basin. And I think we'll see how that goes, but I believe we're definitely on the backside of the number of trades that are going to be happening. Drew E. Venker: I appreciate the color. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Drew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gordon Douthat : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Travis, I just wanted to get back to your comment on the shift towards execution and appreciate what you said as far as how that impacts your M&A strategy. But just wanted to get a sense on, if anything, if that changes how you view your development strategy and the assets currently in hand, either through spacing, completion designs, or stacked bench drilling, any type of configuration changes we might be seeing as you kind of look to execute going forward. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, all of those things, Gordon, are things that we test internally. We've tested them in the back-half of 2015 and then through all of 2016. We tend to be more conservative in the communication of the results, and we're conservative in the number of locations that we talk about under our asset base. Rather than try to convince you in a PowerPoint presentation in our investor deck that we have a lot of locations, we try to underpin those decisions based on the testing. And that testing has to generate a greater return than what we'd do on a standalone basis. So Mike mentioned our continued completion optimization being a rate of return focused. That's the way we think about all of the issues that you just outlined. It has to generate an incremental NPV, and it has to generate a greater rate of return for our investors. If it does, we do so. If it doesn't, we'll let other people do that. So it's all part of the way that we think about converting rock into cash flow. We want to do that as efficiently as we can, and I think so far our track record looks pretty good. Gordon Douthat : Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, and Gordon, one other thing on that is we've talked about our shift to resource execution. That's not to imply that we haven't always been focused on resource execution. In fact, if you look at the metrics that we care about whether it's time to TD or our cash operating cost and our cash margins per barrel, all of those are indicative of how we have been very focused on executing where our existing asset basis is. I think one of the best measures that kind of separate a lot of companies is if you look at just your proved developed F&D cost because you've got audited numbers in the numerator and audited numbers in the denominator. And that's a good measure of efficiency of a company, we believe. And I think if you look at Diamondback's number of $7.26, I think we'll stand up pretty good under that scrutiny. Gordon Douthat : Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Burwell from Canaccord. Your line is open. Sam Burwell : Good morning, guys. I wanted to clarify one thing on kind of the upper bound of your guidance both on the number of completions and the 76,000 to date. Does that factor in 10 rigs in the back half of 2017, or is that really just the eight-rig base case kind of...? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, that's more the eight-rig base case. If you think about the ninth or tenth rig we've talked about, if they come it'll be certainly back half weighted, likely in the fourth quarter, certainly for the tenth rig. So you won't have any current year impact to speak of for either the eighth or the ninth rig \u2013 I'm sorry, the ninth or the tenth rig. Sam Burwell : Yeah, all right. That makes us. And I think this was touched on before, but those two incremental rigs would likely go to Delaware? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, we're still balancing that, but likely, that's the case. We just need to make sure. We've got to take over operations, and so take over operations of the Southern Delaware block we bought from Brigham, and we'll do that until March 1. So we'll make that decision in the upcoming quarters. Sam Burwell : Okay. And then the final one would be how do you guys see your corporate oil cut developing over the next year or two now that you're just kind of layering in some Delaware production? Do you expect it to stay pretty much the same or to trend up a little bit? Travis D. Stice: Yes. When we bought the acquisition, one of the things that we got quite a bit of surprise from our investors was the fact that there wasn't a great deal of understanding of where the highest oil cut was in the Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware. And in fact the Brigham assets is located in areas that have the highest oil cut and on the whole Southern Delaware. So when you think of Diamondback on a standalone basis, pre-acquisition, we kind of had a 73% to 75% oil cut. As we begin to aggressively develop our assets in the Southern Delaware, our oil cut actually goes up probably to 78% to 80%. Sam Burwell : Sounds good. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan from Mizuho. Your line is open. Timothy A. Rezvan: Hi. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my call. You all have been a little less outspoken than some peers on the focus operationally on high-intensity fracs. I was wondering if you could talk about how widespread that implementation is. I know you talked about it in Andrews County. And maybe if you can discuss how that changes the use of artificial lift and what it's doing for your curves? Michael L. Hollis: Hey, Tim, this is Mike. On the Midland Basin side, the high-density near-wellbore fracs are a standard completion design across all of our areas. As far as what they do from an artificial lift standpoint, the total amount of fluid coming out of the well is still fairly similar to what we had before. So as far as artificial lift, the standard ESPs or gas lift that we typically use are about the same. What we have seen, and I think you'll see in some of the slides, are some of the declines are muted a little bit, so we have the ESPs on a little longer than we may have had in the past before we changed over to rod pump. Timothy A. Rezvan: Okay. And then I guess you have to drill before you have an idea on the Delaware, but do you have any initial thoughts on \u2013 will the high intensity be the standard? Or do you plan to walk up your completion design there? Michael L. Hollis: So the Southern Delaware is a little farther along and it's been kind of a very accelerated pace of change for the Delaware, but it went from just a 200 pounds per foot to know upwards to 2,500 pounds per foot to 2,000 pounds per foot. So when we go over there, that is similar to what we're doing now in the Midland Basin side. So we'll have a very similar program when we start completing wells through Diamondback on the Brigham asset as well as the Luxe asset. So the answer is yes. It will basically be the same. It will have a slightly higher amount of stimulation fluid per foot and sand per foot than we do on the Midland Basin side, but comparable. Timothy A. Rezvan: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Congrats on a strong end to 2016. Just curious, we've heard a lot of commentary from other producers about pretty back-weighted production profiles over the course of 2017. I'm just curious if you'd be willing to provide any expectations or color as to how the 4Q 2017 looks relative to, I don't know, maybe on a year-over-year basis, or just how steep or how linear the production profile might look over the course of 2017? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Michael, we've always stayed away from quarterly guidance. There's so much uncertainty in the way that we bring these wells on with these multi-well pads, and then you have the water-out effect. And so if we get into quarter guidance, then there's some quarters they get out in front of us and some quarters because of the operations and water-out effects we had they kind of get behind us. So I think in a general sense, you're going to have a pretty smooth progression of volumes. But that being said though, we've got to get out there and execute and we know we'll see interruptions in productions as we progress the volume growth through the year. Michael Anthony Hall : Fair enough. Appreciate it. I figured it was worth the shot. And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about just your thoughts on spacing. Mike, you highlighted in the deck, you do have a more conservative view on spacing than some of the peers or your peers out there. I'm just curious how you guys think about the risks of I guess leaving resource behind in that context and just where your current thoughts are on under versus over-capitalizing the acreage and how you play that risk? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, generally, in each of our areas, we're still in testing mode right now. One thing we have seen is from what we call our high-density near-wellbore fracs based on our microseismic monitoring, we're seeing some good results from that and that we are keeping the frac near-wellbore that gives us some hope that tighter well spacing will work. So we're testing that pretty much in each of our areas now. Midland County is probably the furthest along, and we've got several multi-well pads that we've just brought on to test that concept. So over the next several quarters, I think we'll have a lot better idea than we do right now. But I'll play some of the early results do provide some hope, but each area is different. Michael Anthony Hall : What's sort of the tightest spacing configuration that you guys are currently testing in those pilots? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I mean the tightest we're doing is essentially 500-foot spacing with staggered landing zones in the Lower Spraberry in Midland County. We've got some working interest in some other operator wells that are testing, kind of, 500-foot spacing in some of the Wolfcamp zones that we're monitoring. So that's essentially the tightest that we've done to this point. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to maybe step back, look longer term. You guys provided a comment in the Brigham slide deck at that time that you thought the assets now could support 15 to 20 rigs. I think in the past you talked about the potential for, call it, two rigs per 10,000 acres or so which would suggest quite a bit more than that 15 to 20 rig comment. Care to maybe talk about how we bridge that gap? Or what sort of upside there might be to that 15 to 20-rig potential over time as you move deeper into development mode? Travis D. Stice: Sure. The comment that we made at acquisition time was 15 to 20 rigs, but that encompassed both asset sides. Michael Anthony Hall : Sure. Travis D. Stice: The Midland Basin side and the Delaware Basin side and we have made the comments that roughly 10,000 acres is a good \u2013 two rigs per 10,000 acres is a good mantra. What we're trying to do is we look at that ramp to 20 rigs in the future and trying to manage the efficiencies that we need to really convert that rock into cash flow and to the extent that commodity price and service cost allow us to generate that free cash flow, we can continue to increase rigs accordingly. But we've got ways to go before we get there. Michael Anthony Hall : Sure. Travis D. Stice: So, right now, we're building an organization now to handle that 15 to 20 rigs. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And in that context then, how are you on people for 2017 and as you ramp towards 2018, do you have a lot of hiring to be done as you bring on particularly this Brigham asset? And maybe just an update on your people? Travis D. Stice: Sure. I believe within the last year, we had about 160 employees for an enterprise value company of around $11 billion or $12 billion. We recognize that in order to execute the way we want to continue to execute in the future, we're going to have to add some very achievement oriented, very best at their craft individuals and we're in the process of doing that right now. And I'm pleased with the applicant flow that we've had that's going to allow us to do just that, find the exceptional contributors that are going to continue to propel Diamondback forward in the future. Michael Anthony Hall : Very good. I appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Michael. Michael Anthony Hall : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Michael Dugan Kelly : Hey, guys. Good morning. Travis D. Stice: Good Morning Mike. Michael Dugan Kelly : My buddy, Michael Hall, just stole all five of my questions there. But there's one that I've been interested on. I've heard rumblings of the formation of a third kind of snake-based entity out of you guys that's focused on the midstream side of things. And Travis, maybe, I was hoping you could expand on this raptor entity that may or may not really be in the works right now? Thanks. Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Mike. This is Kaes. Really, it's just we see value in midstream, and when we entered the Southern Delaware, we had two blank space assets that we could build out gathering systems on. I think we put a slide in there describing our existing Spanish Trail oil gathering assets, and we want to build on that by building oil gathering in, on the Brigham asset as well as the other Southern Delaware asset we purchased last year. So, we see a value proposition in midstream. For the purposes of the near-term, it's just to maximize realizations. But we've seen some successful deals via our peers and their midstream assets, and I think we're of the size today that we're going to be spending money on infrastructure and might as well get a good return out of it for the long-term. Michael Dugan Kelly : Got it. Now do you see that as an opportunity to maybe get more aggressive on the spending there? I know you kind of highlighted that there's some one-time infrastructure CapEx going into this year, but can we see that maybe, Travis, get more aggressive on that front in 2018 and beyond? Or is this ultimately spun into an MLP, sold? And any kind of higher-level strategic thoughts of where you want to go with it? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, I mean, we'd like to control everything on our lease that we have 100% utilization. So if we have 100% utilization, we're going to drill with saltwater disposal wells, we're going to have the water transfer systems, we're going to have the oil gathering, in some cases, even gas gathering, and we're in for value creation and value maximization no matter what. So whether that's a public entity or sale or just holding it, we'll look at all options. Michael Dugan Kelly : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys. Great quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler from Wunderlich. Your line is open. Jason A. Wangler: Good morning, Travis. Just had one more question. You talked a lot obviously about M&A, and you've been active in that market. But as you look at the position and even referencing slide 4 from the presentation, outside of those six core areas, just kind of what are the plans for those pieces of acreage and how you see those kind of fitting in the portfolio going forward? Is that just further down the line? Or is there potential trades and divestitures; things of that nature? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, it's all of the above. It could be further down the line, it could be a trade, it could be a divestiture. And again, we're just focused on the maximum value creation that we have. So we believe that the assets that are outside those circles on that map still have tremendous value, and we want to see whether that value is best for our shareholders or if we can monetize them and create even more value through our shareholders. So all of those equations are open right now. Again, our focus right now is to get the acquisition in the Delaware closed and then get our execution machine cranked up in the Southern Delaware side of things. Jason A. Wangler: Great. Thanks, Travis. I'll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff S. Grampp: Good morning, guys. Question on potential acceleration, Travis, talking about going from 8 rigs to maybe 10 rigs at some point this year, and it sounds like it's mostly dependent on commodity prices. Is any of that dependent on infrastructure buildout in the Delaware? Or do you guys feel pretty good about where things are and potentially adding a couple more rigs there in 2017? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, no, of course it depends on infrastructure build-out, and that's why we're getting started on it even before we close the acquisition. We're not going to accelerate activity if we can't convert that immediately into cash flow. That being said though, we've always talked about the Midland Basin side of our asset base can handle up to 10 rigs. So if there's a scenario where we want to accelerate the inventory, we're not ready for whatever reason on the Delaware Basin side, we have plenty of capacity on the Midland Basin side to be able to do that. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. Got it. And just on the kind of smaller bolt-ons or kind of netting up your working interest on the Delaware side, do you guys feel that that's largely, I guess for lack of a better term, kind of tapped-out? Or do you still see some opportunities, I guess more specifically, with the Luxe asset in ramping that working interest higher? Travis D. Stice: No, I'm real proud of our, particularly our land organization since we closed that Luxe acquisition. I think we took, as I said in Mike's prepared remarks, it went from 49% at the acquisition time, now we're up to 73%. That's really a good job by our land organization, a lot of heavy lifting. We're going to continue to do that. That's what we do. That's part of our core competency. We believe that we should try to own 100% of the working interest of every well that we drill, and we're going to continue to do that. So no, Jeff, I wouldn't say that that effort is done with. Jeff S. Grampp: Okay. Great. Appreciate the time, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Hey. Thank you, and good morning, folks. Just want to follow-up on your comments about full cycle returns. That's a measure you seldom hear about in the oil and gas business. How does that measure dictate what you would pay for leasehold? That is, is there a maximum price you would pay in an acquisition as measured on a per location basis? At what price doesn't it make sense to acquire leasehold? And what do you see as your full cycle returns on the Brigham assets? Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, those are all good questions, Dan. Obviously we're not going to get into a lot of details on how we look internally on what we'll pay for acquisitions. I do know that the higher per acreage cost \u2013 and we steer clear of location camps because I think there's some liberties in the number of locations that typically get communicated. So we just look at on acreage count, the dollar per acreage count, and we run our full cycle returns against that. And the greater you pay on a dollar per acre basis, the lower your corporate returns are going to be. So it's just one of those things we continue to look at. On every deal that we do we look at the full cycle returns, and that's how we make our decisions. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Got it. Much appreciated. Have a great day. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. I'm seeing no other questioners in the queue at this time so I'd like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Andrew. Thanks again for everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference call. This now concludes the program, and you may now disconnect at this time. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Adam Lawlis, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, go ahead. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Bruce. Good morning, and welcome the Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2017 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements related to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, Viper Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Diamondback, will be hosting its conference call at 10 :00 AM Central today. Dial-in details can be found on Viper's release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's first quarter 2017 conference call. Diamondback has continued the momentum from the second half of 2016 into the first quarter of 2017. Production continues to rise, up 19% quarter over quarter, to over 61,000 BOEs a day. Well results continue to improve across our asset base and we have begun operations in the Southern Delaware Basin after closing two transformative acquisitions in the last three quarters and more than doubling our acreage footprint of Tier 1 inventory. We're excited about the well results announced from our first operated wells in the Southern Delaware Basin in this quarter's release, and I'm proud of the organization for the seamless integration of these assets in a short period of time. We are operating eight rigs today, six in the Midland Basin and two in the Southern Delaware Basin, with plans to move to five rigs in the Midland Basin and three in the Delaware Basin later this month. Diamondback is currently operating three frac spreads with one of those operating in the Delaware Basin. We could potentially increase our operated rig count to 9 or 10 rigs in the back half of the year should commodity prices improve from current levels. Put simply, if returns to our investors go up, we will increase our activity to take advantage of those returns, with a current asset base capable of running up to 20 rigs as operating cash flow allows. If returns to our investors pull back, we have the operational and financial flexibility to respond accordingly. Our full year 2017 production guidance remains unchanged with over 65% annual production growth at the midpoint. Diamondback continues to deliver on its corporate mission of best-in-class execution and low-cost operations, with cash operating costs of $9.31 per BOE and well costs essentially flat compared to Q4 2016 due to increased efficiencies and service cost control. We have hired many more exceptional employees over the last several months to help us continue to execute as we increase activity on our larger asset base. We also continue to be pleased with the strength of our well results across our acreage, which Mike will elaborate upon later. As shown on slide 4, we have accumulated a strong inventory with six core areas capable of 1 million barrel-plus EURs. In each of these areas, we are focused on long lateral development with more than 85% of our locations having 7,500 foot or longer laterals. We've now built an organization with an inventory that we expect will, at current strip prices, allow us to grow at best-in-class rates within cash flow for many years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Diamondback continues to post encouraging results and achieve new company-execution milestones. Turning to slide 7, we have new data from our first operated completions in the Southern Delaware Basin. In Ward County, the Coldblood well, a 7,500 foot lateral targeting the Wolfcamp A, completed in early April, has produced 210 BOE/d per 1,000 foot of lateral for its first 15 days with an 88% oil cut. Our first operated completions in Pecos County, the two McIntyre State wells, produced an average 30 day IP rate of 158 BOE/d per 1,000 foot of lateral with an 89% oil cut. Additionally, on the Pecos/Reeves County line, we completed the State McGary well that achieved a 24-hour IP rate of 243 BOE/d per 1,000 foot of completed lateral with an 85% oil cut. We are currently running two rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin with one dedicated completion crew and plan to move a third operated rig from the Midland Basin to the Delaware Basin this month. We continue to optimize our completion design for the Southern Delaware Basin with a focus on maximizing NPV and rate of return. Slide 8 lays out the recent developments discussed earlier across our Southern Delaware Basin position. We look forward to developing these assets with wells landed, drilled, and completed by Diamondback throughout 2017. Slide 9 goes into further detail on our development plans for the Wolfcamp A in the Southern Delaware Basin. Our primary landing target is within the upper portion of the Wolfcamp A. As you can see from these well results posted on this page, these wells have a much flatter decline profile than what we have typically seen in the Midland Basin. Now turning to the Midland Basin, slide 11, shows our continued strong well results across the basin. To note, Howard County continues to outperform expectations, and each pad has had better well results than the prior pad, again, led by the Wolfcamp A. In Midland County, we highlight the Wolfcamp A well results, which places this zone in a close second to the Lower Spraberry from a returns perspective. On the lower right portion of the page, we show well results from two child wells targeting the Lower Spraberry in Andrews County using our High Density Near Wellbore frac design. The early results show these two wells are outperforming their parent wells, a positive indicator for the targeted goal of increasing recoveries from a smaller stimulated rock volume. Turning to operations and execution, slide 12 showcases our continued track record of execution, as D,C&E costs are down 44% from 2014, and down 5% when compared to fourth quarter 2016. We have forecasted service cost inflation in our 2017 CapEx budget, primarily from completions. Diamondback is proactively mitigating these costs where appropriate. For instance, we're looking at de-bundling services on the completion side of the business, and have a large percentage of tubular goods forward purchased. Slide 13 demonstrates our ability to effectively convert resource into cash flow. At $50 oil, the Lower Spraberry in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp A in the Southern Delaware Basin have economics that pay back 80% of capital cost in year one. We have other zones throughout both basins that will compete for capital. But these two zones will be the foundation for our multi-year production growth expectations, even in a sub $50 oil world. Slide 14 reflects our spacing assumptions relative to our peers, leading considerable upside from downspacing potential. Over 85% of our locations have lateral lengths of 7,500 feet or longer. Diamondback has continued to have success bolting on acreage and trading with other operators to block up our position. The capital efficiency of longer laterals is well recognized, and we have now completed up to 12,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. Slide 15 shows our operational efficiency over time, as well as our current leverage metrics, cash margins, and recycle ratio. We feel the recycle ratio clearly depicts Diamondback as a leader in creating value for its shareholders, given our high cash margins per barrel and industry-leading capital efficiencies. With these comments now complete, I will turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's first quarter 2017 net income was $136 million, or $1.46 per diluted share. Diamondback's first quarter 2017 net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives was $97 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $175 million, up 27% from Q4 2016, due to increased production and realized pricing. Diamondback's average realized price per BOE, including hedges, for the first quarter of 2017 was $41.63. During the quarter, our cash G&A costs were $1.20 per BOE, while non-cash G&A was $1.28. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $100 million on drilling and completion, and $16 million on infrastructure and non-op properties. We continue to expect to spend within our annual CapEx guidance of $800 million to $1 billion as we maintain our April activity levels and begin our infrastructure investments. As shown on slide 17, Diamondback ended the first quarter of 2017 with a net debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. Additionally, our lead bank recently recommended increasing our borrowing base to $1.5 billion, from $1 billion previously. We plan to increase our elected commitment to $750 million from $500 million previously. Our full-year 2017 guidance presented on slide 18 remains unchanged for the year, with the exception of the introduction of corporate tax rate guidance of 0% to 5% and lower full-year interest expense per BOE. At current strip prices, we expect to deliver annualized production growth of over 65% at or near breakeven cash flow. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another strong quarter because of our commitment to execution and low-cost operations. Our production was up as a result of continued outstanding well performance. Our track record of acquiring properties and subsequently executing above acquisition model expectations gives me confidence we have the organization in place to transfer our best-in-class execution and cost control from the Midland Basin to our over 100,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, and to drive growth at or near cash flow for many years to come. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Michael Glick from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael A. Glick: Morning. Just... Travis D. Stice: Morning. Michael A. Glick: Given the volatility of the oil market, could you talk a little bit about capital flexibility, kind of at what price point would you look to slow down, and where would you do it? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. We talk directionally \u2013 I always hesitate to giving precise oil price, but directionally, if we're in that $45 to $50 range, I think we're very comfortable and we have the balance sheet to be able to execute with our current activity levels. I think if it starts dropping below $40, somewhere between $40 and $45 a barrel, we'll probably take a pause and see exactly what our future plans need to look like. And then I think on the other end of the spectrum, if it's $50 to $55, something like that, we'll look at potentially increasing activity in the back half of the year. I think, Michael, one of the reasons that we were hesitant in trying to change guidance at this point of the year is I think there's still a lot of uncertainty in the oil markets. And we want to make sure we preserve the optionality to drive the best returns to our investors, and we will do so just like we've done in the past. Michael A. Glick: Got it. And then just kind of high level on the Pecos County assets, how has your view on the acreage changed since you announced the acquisition last year? Any positive surprises? Travis D. Stice: Well, I think if you just look at the well results we put in this release, on the ReWard acreage, we knew that acreage was going to be good, particularly in the Wolfcamp A and the 3rd Bone Spring, and we're really pleased with what we've seen in that Coldblood well at over \u2013 a really good 15-day rate. I think the McGary well, which was a well that's landed in the Upper Wolfcamp A, which is what we underpinned the acquisition at, that's been a nice surprise. And the McIntyre wells that were landed in the Lower Wolfcamp A, those are still at our acquisition type curve. And so even though it wasn't in necessarily the zone that we think are going to be the dominant development zone, even those wells are at our acquisition type curve. So we feel pretty confident across the asset base and, of course, we continue to watch industry activity, not only for well results but also for continued optimization on the completion side. So all in all, we're really encouraged with what we've seen at these early times. Keep in mind, we took over operations March 1, so it's still early in the game, but we're really pleased with what we've seen. Michael A. Glick: Got it. And then just maybe one more on Pecos County. As you ramp up your operated program, could you talk about your latest thinking on landing zones and completion design? Travis D. Stice: Yes. So in Pecos County, what we've talked about even at acquisition time was sort of that Gen 3, Gen 4 level where we're somewhere around 2,000 pounds to 2500 pounds per foot. We think in Pecos County, the Upper Wolfcamp A, which is where the McGary well was landed, is going to be the dominant zone. And so far with good IP24 in a week or so (15:33) production, that really looks good. So we're monitoring the things that are going on out in the Delaware just like we always do. We're fast followers and we'll continue to experiment with diverters and sand loadings until we find the optimal balance of sand, fluid and rate of return and net present value. Michael A. Glick: Got it. Thank you very much. Travis D. Stice: You bet, Michael. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann: Morning, guys. Travis, a question around the Delaware acreage, particularly the Brigham acreage. With that, you brought in a fair amount of minerals. I'm just wondering, what you'll be drilling there in the nearer term is \u2013 I know you've got some older slides that shows the upside in Viper to what it does in some of the other Midland acres, and I'm just wondering when one looks at (16:26) the Delaware, two questions, one, will a good bit of that be drilled where you have the mineral fee acres as well? And then number two, does that upside, is that proportionally about the same as what it's been for the other Viper units? Travis D. Stice: I'll let Kaes answer the question specifically, but I'll tell you just in a general sense from the Viper side, every time we have a drill schedule meeting, 2:00 on Thursdays and a well gets proposed to the executive team, the first question is, do we have minerals underneath that well location? So we always try to push activity towards our ownership in minerals. Kaes, do you want to answer this one? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I'll also add that with the two or three rigs that we're going to be operating in that area, primarily we're going to focus on holding leases. And then outside of that, those rigs will be drilling on Viper minerals and getting the cash flow up on those assets for the right time to drop those minerals down, so. Had a lot of success buying more minerals in that area and I think it's a good sign for Viper as well. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. And then, guys, just one last one. We continue to hear talk about OFS inflation. Just, Travis, in general, what some things you all are continuing to do. Just was noticed in (17:48) some of your wells versus some of the peers, and it tends to be a bit lower for some time, the equivalent sort of frac schedule. I'm just wondering of some things that you all are doing, how are you doing that to keep some costs a bit lower than others? Travis D. Stice: Well it's not just one or two things, it's really a systematic approach to the whole organization, and trying to do things that generate the best returns at the lowest costs. And that sounds a little maybe esoteric, but really it is about culturally trying to do the best we can with the \u2013 and expend the least amount of money, in order to be the low-cost operator. Specifically, the efficiency gains we continue to push on the drilling side. As Mike talked about, we began trying to debundle some of the pressure pumping services in order to control some of those things, like diesel for example. We buy and supply our own diesel for the frac companies and the drilling rigs. So it's just a series, Neal, of a bunch of things that we try that we're picking pennies up and when you pick up enough pennies, you make a dollar, and so, while we were proud that even while we're trying to digest $3 billion worth of acquisitions, we were able to push costs down quarter over quarter. I think we said about 5% quarter over quarter. We know that trend won't continue if commodity prices continue to strengthen through the rest of this year, but we're real comfortable with where our CapEx guidance is, with a 10% overall increase in well costs throughout the full year and, as we reported, we really didn't see that in the first quarter. So I'm confident that our business partners are aware what's going on on the service side, are aware what's going on in the commodity-price world, and I'm confident that our organization has the ability to execute differentially to control costs as well, as activity levels pick up. Neal D. Dingmann: Perfect, guys. Thanks for the details. Operator : And our next question comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Drew E. Venker: Morning, everyone. I was hoping on Southern Delaware, you could talk about the plans in Pecos County. Sounds like you're focusing on the Central acreage block, but I'm just curious how much other testing you'd be doing in the other parts of Pecos this year. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, I mean, right now, as Kaes mentioned, we're primarily focused on near term leasehold wells, which, the biggest piece of those is kind of on the Eastern block of the acreage, where we've seen good well results previously. But we've got scattered obligations across the acreage, and we'll continue to drill those as well. So you'll see a mix as we bring in that third rig, we'll also do some other testing as well. Travis D. Stice: Drew, just to clarify that, when Russell mentioned the eastern side of the acreage, we're talking about that Central block, not that portion of the acreage that's down in the southeast \u2013 the far southeast. Drew E. Venker: Right. Travis D. Stice: So it's where (20:55) we've got a bunch of good wells in that kind of Central \u2013 big Central block, he's talking about the eastern edge of that. Drew E. Venker: Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then across the entire Southern Delaware, how much experimentation would you expect with the completion design? You talked about going back to the Gen 3 completions, not sure how much you think that might need to be changed, or how much additional proppant loading should be (21:19) testing this year? Travis D. Stice: Well, Drew, we've never stopped tweaking and kind of changing our completion recipe since the very beginning. We believe that, in an organization that demonstrates excellence, you've got to always look for continuous improvement, and that's what we're trying to do. So we do so with our own testing with proppant loading, as well as following what the industry's doing as well. I'll tell you one thing that I think is a little bit different about Diamondback is that, most of the testing that we do \u2013 not most, all the testing we do \u2013 we always underpin with, what's the corresponding rate of return and net present value impact for that decision? And so, I think right now, we're going to stay in that proppant loading of around 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per foot. We'll probably continue to experiment with the cluster spacing and stage spacing. But again, we understand that the Delaware Basin is new not only for Diamondback, but is still relatively new for the industry. So we're going to watch what goes on very, very closely with other operators in the Delaware. And if we feel like we can generate differential returns to our investors, we'll modify the completion or the drilling or any of the things that we think will drive better returns for our investors. Drew E. Venker: Makes sense. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Gordon Douthat from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Gordon Douthat : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question on the downspacing, looked like \u2013 the initial data looked promising, I guess, in Andrews County. So my question is, to what extent have you tested downspacing elsewhere across your acreage? And from what I can tell, looks like it's just in the Lower Spraberry here in Andrews, have you done any downspacing in any of the other zones as well? Russell Pantermuehl : Yes, I mean, we've done a lot of 500-foot spacing wells in our Midland County assets in the Lower Spraberry, this Andrews County is our first test at 500-foot spacing in the Lower Spraberry there for the most part. And our other assets on the east side of the basin, we're primarily at 660-foot spacing in the Lower Spraberry, the A and the B [Wolfcamp A and B]. We do have some offset operators in our Midland County stuff that are testing downspacing, primarily in the Wolfcamp A, and so we're watching that data pretty closely as well, depending on those results, we may do some additional downspacing in the Wolfcamp A. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And then understanding that it takes some time to see how the wells produce and to see how the economics ultimately play out, but what is that timeframe in your view? How long does it take to make the decision we're going to go 500-foot spacing on a go-forward basis? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, but it's going to take a little time, just like our Andrews County test. That's one three-well pad, so we'll have to drill some additional wells there before we make a wholesale decision to go to tighter spacing across that whole area. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And then one last one for me. On the parent-child production slide that you put up there looked pretty promising. What were those wells spaced on versus \u2013 where were the child wells spaced versus the parent wells? Russell Pantermuehl : All the wells are on 660-foot spacing for those four wells. Gordon Douthat : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Gail Nicholson from KLR Group. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. When you talk about being an asset capable of running 20 rigs, is that driven by surface acreage or is that driven by drilling inventory? Travis D. Stice: Gail, it's more a function of surface acreage in how efficiently we can coordinate drilling and completion operations, it's not a function of inventory. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Great. And then just looking at the Delaware and the first, execution of the drilling standpoint on the ReWard area as well as the Pecos area, has anything surprised you in the drilling aspect? From an efficiency aspect, have you been more efficient, quicker? Or kind of what's the thoughts on improving those TD days (26:06) in the Delaware? Michael L. Hollis: You bet, Gail. This is Mike Hollis. Hey, the answer's yes. We've seen a lot and learned a lot, and obviously, as we do our research and look at what other folks are doing out there, it's really not until you get in the sand box that you really get to learn how the rocks are going to act and talk to you. So we've learned a lot in our last couple wells, and we will draw the same kind of optimization that we have in the Midland Basin side over in the Delaware side. Again, just for the depth and the pressure regimes, it should end up taking a couple days longer on the Delaware side than the Midland side, but you'll see us start migrating toward the Midland performance. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then just also from a standpoint looking at your conservative spacing, in the Delaware, it looks like you're only assuming one zone in the Wolfcamp A, but I'm assuming when you're landing them, are you landing them in the upper zone, you have the ability to go back and do the lower zone at a later date? Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah. But that's just something we'll evaluate over time. And as we said, as we bring in the third rig in the Delaware, we'll probably do some pilot testing where we're testing Upper and Lower A together, but right now we don't have enough data to say that we can do that. But we're optimistic. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from John Nelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations on a really, really strong quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, John. John Nelson : Your oil mix came in ahead of Street estimates for the quarter. As I take a look at the ops update, your (27:53) 90% oil wells. I'm wondering if you could just speak at a high level of how should we expect that oil mix to trend over the next couple quarters. Russell Pantermuehl : I think it'll stay about flat, there'll be variation quarter to quarter, as we've always seen. As you noted on the Delaware side, we're in a really high oil cut area, but on the Midland side, eastern side of the Midland Basin where we've seen really good overall results, and we'll continue with activity there. Those are a little bit gassier, so I think overall, probably for the remainder of the year, we should probably stay close to that 75% oil cut level. John Nelson : That's helpful. And then some of your peers have noted inflationary pressures in the Delaware Basin are running a bit hotter versus the Midland Basin. Could you just comment, is that something you all are seeing as well? Or any kind of quantification would just be helpful. Michael L. Hollis: You bet, John. We see about the same inflationary pressure from both basins. Most of the inflation that we've seen has been on the pressure pumping side and again, pressure pumping in from the sand side. So when you go to the Delaware, where a lot of folks are still experimenting with really high sand loadings and large jobs, they're getting a disproportionate size of inflation that they're seeing from the Delaware side. But in general, we're seeing about the same from both basins. John Nelson : And then just one true up (29:29). If you did add the 9th and 10th rigs in the back half of the year, is that something that was already contemplated in the 2017 capital guidance of $800 to $1 billion, or would that be something that would either require efficiency gains or for you to raise that budget? Michael L. Hollis: John, our original budget was from 6 to 10 rigs and that had us from that $800 to $1 billion price range. So they were baked into the initial guidance that we'd given. John Nelson : So the high end of that range. Okay. Perfect. That's all. Congrats again on a really strong quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan McSpirit from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Thank you, folks. Good morning. Can you share your view on basis differentials? Asking in light of the basis swaps you've added in 2018 at less than $1 dollar per barrel. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Hey, Dan. This is Kaes. We're pretty happy with the basis hedges we have on at this point. We're also very encouraged by the announcements that have happened in the last quarter on greenfield expansion as well as the brownfield projects that are being expanded over the summer. So we're happy where we are today. And I think you'll see that these midstream guys are looking to fund these greenfield projects, given the growth they're seeing coming out of the basin. So I think we're pretty happy with where our hedge position sits, and where the takeaway capacity is heading out of the basin. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Great. Thank you. And as a follow-up, just a question on portfolio management, if you will. If we look out 9, 12 months from now, after the company has had time to, I guess, fully digest the acquisition, what basin or operation, Midland or Delaware, yields the highest return in your view? And is there anything in the portfolio that can't compete or won't compete for capital, and could be a candidate for divestiture? Travis D. Stice: Yes. I think the first part of that question is \u2013 we addressed in one of the slides, I can't remember which slide it is, but we actually say that what we see in the Upper Wolfcamp A, even at the higher cost, because you have a higher EUR per foot, it's competitive with the Lower Spraberry in the Northern Midland Basin. So, if that premise holds true in the next 12 months, well then you should have equal allocation of capital in both sides of the basin. And the second question was, are there portions of the portfolio which don't make sense to allocate capital to initially. And I think, like any company, when you look at some of the inventory that's out on the very tail end, it's going to have a hard time competing for capital. So, would we divest? I don't know. We've got a lot to say grace over right now, so we're focusing on trying to execute and some of the late portfolio development assets, we'll address that sometime through the course of this year. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Very good. Thank you. Have a great day. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Dan. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Travis, what was the drilling completion cost for the initial FANG-operated Delaware Basin wells? Have you already achieved the completions cost referenced in the investor presentation at $550 per foot level? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Richard, I'm going to let Mike address the question specifically, but I will tell you that, early on in the Delaware Basin, we've done some science that -science means more expense in these first couple of wells, but I'll let Mike talk about them specifically. Michael L. Hollis: So Richard, on the completion specifically, with your $550 question, the answer is yes, the completions have all come in at or right near our cost for the $550. Total drill complete and what we've had to do from the equip side up to this point, of course, these wells are naturally flowing right now, so the equip piece is a little smaller than normal. But we have, as Travis said, done some science, so ex-science, we're right in our guidance range for the wells. Richard Merlin Tullis : All right. Thank you. Michael L. Hollis: For the drill bit side.(33:44) Richard Merlin Tullis : And then, what percentage do you expect in, say, the second half of the year of the Delaware Basin wells will be drilled on two-well pads? Michael L. Hollis: So Richard, after the first four, five wells in each one of our big blocks, those \u2013 Brigham piece as well as the Luxe piece, will go to pad development after that point. And when we bring that third rig over, that will obviously make it a lot easier to drill pad wells and still meet the few obligations that we have throughout the year. Richard Merlin Tullis : All right. Thank you. And Travis, how's the infrastructure buildout proceeding in the Delaware Basin? And what do you expect infrastructure spending could be over, say, the next one or two years? And just your current view on maybe infrastructure being a more meaningful asset within the FANG portfolio going forward. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Richard, I'm going to let Kaes answer that question. He's got his finger on that pulse pretty closely. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Richard, the large projects are proceeding as planned. We didn't spend that much money in Q1, just because we closed Brigham at the end of February. So, through the rest of this year, we still have $150 million to $175 million budgeted for infrastructure, and I would say that spend is going to be fairly even over the last three quarters of the year. On the Brigham stuff, we did acquire gathering system on the gas side that was in place, and some significant water assets that were in place. So that's allowed us to seamlessly transition into that asset. In the long term, we're focused on maximizing our netbacks at Diamondback, and that's why we're building these systems over the next 9 to 12 months. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay. And then just lastly, so 1Q, obviously, a very strong quarter for cost controls. How much more opportunity do you see at FANG for driving OpEx cost even lower, or at least keeping it flattish, given you're coming out of acquiring a sizable asset there, so perhaps that presents some opportunities to keep the momentum going? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Richard, you've heard me say before that we'll never quit pushing on the LOE reduction side until we can produce these wells for free. So I'm not ready to say we're going to go the other way at any time. But the reality is that we've got a lot of new assets we're bringing in and it takes all of our field organization every day, leaning into the brace (36:17), trying to make sure we produce these wells as efficiently and as cost effectively as we can. And like I said, we didn't make a bullet point out of it on our earnings release, but even in the process of dialing in (36:30) 100,000 new acres, our field organization lowered LOE quarter over quarter, which I was real proud of them for being able to do that, especially against the backdrop of acquiring new assets. Richard Merlin Tullis : Well, that's all for me. Great quarter. Thanks a bunch. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Richard. Operator : And our next question comes from John Aschenbeck from Seaport Global. Your line is now open. John W. Aschenbeck: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. A lot of the good ones have already been addressed, but did have a question here on timing of test of additional zones in Pecos County. And I understand most the activity this year is going to focus on the A, but if I recall, I believe you had several Bone Spring completions scheduled for this year. So was just curious to get an update on the timing of those tests and when we should expect results. Thanks. Russell Pantermuehl : Yeah, we've got a couple of DUCs that Brigham drilled that we'll be completing that are in the Bone Springs. And as we mentioned at acquisition time, they had some previous Bone Springs test, had some nice results. Right now, we don't have any specific additional Bone Springs test scheduled on the Brigham acreage this year, but we'll just complete those DUCs and see how those results stack up with the Wolfcamp A before making a decision on a go-forward basis. John W. Aschenbeck: Okay. Got it. And I guess, just be looking for those results in the back half of the year, then. Russell Pantermuehl : Correct. John W. Aschenbeck: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : And that this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice for any closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference, and this does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.

Lawlis: Thank you, Demetrius. Good morning, and welcome the Diamondback Energy's second quarter 2017 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated Investor Presentation which can be found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's second quarter 2017 conference call. In the past 12 months, as commodity prices recovered, we've more than doubled production and doubled our Tier 1 inventory. We can grow at a differential rate within cash flow for multiple years, even in today's volatile commodity price world because of the quality of our asset base and our commitment to being the lowest-cost operator. Well results continue to improve across our asset base, and we're particularly pleased with our first set of operated wells in the Southern Delaware Basin, including the Second Bone Spring result that can compete for capital with a high rate of return Wolfcamp A in Pecos County. Our relentless focus on capital efficiency and low-cost operations was prevalent this quarter, with less than $8 a barrel cash operating cost and positive free cash flow, excluding acquisitions for the second quarter in a row. Because of these capital efficiencies, we're increasing full year production guidance while lowering CapEx guidance and decreasing both LOE and G&A guidance. We're operating in 9 rigs today, 6 in the Midland Basin and 3 in the Southern Delaware Basin, as well as operating 3 dedicated completion crews. At current commodity prices, we plan to maintain this 8 to 9 rig cadence for the remainder of 2017. As shown on slide 5, our strategy has not changed. We are well positioned to change activity as operational cash flow allows with over 4,300 locations economic at $50 oil and today's capital costs. We believe our combination of best-in-class efficiency and history of accretive acquisitions of Tier 1 assets has consistently driven shareholder value and will allow us to continue to generate industry full cycle returns. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Turning to slide 8. We have new data from multiple well results across our Southern Delaware Basin assets, including 3 Wolfcamp A 30-day IPs and recent data from our first two landed drilled and completed Pecos County Wolfcamp A wells. We are also particularly pleased with the result of our first completed lower Second Bone Spring well on our Pecos asset with an IP30 and oil cut comparable to our best Wolfcamp A wells. We are currently running three rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin with one dedicated completion crew. Additionally, we are maximizing netbacks by building and upgrading the infrastructure across our asset base. Slide 10 shows the performance of our Southern Delaware Basin wells at or above our expected type curves for the area. Early time results in Pecos County suggest that a stack and staggered approach has the potential to increase recovery factors in the area. Slide 12 expands on our success in the Second Bone Spring formation in Pecos County. The Kelley State well, which targeted reservoir rock about 300 feet deeper than previously targeted Second Bone Spring wells in the area, had an IP30 of 190 BOE per thousand feet of lateral comparable to other Wolfcamp A wells in the Delaware Basin. This target is almost 1,000 feet shallower than the Wolfcamp A with less pressure, significantly reducing drilling and completion costs. Turning to the Midland Basin, slide 14 shows encouraging results from our first 500-foot inter-lateral spacing test in Andrews County, compared to 660-foot spaced offset wells. We are currently running six rigs in the Midland Basin and two dedicated completion crews and plan to stay at this pace for the remainder of 2017 at current commodity prices. Slide 15 shows our continued improvement in Howard County, especially in the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry as we have optimized landing points, spacing and completion design over the past 12 months. Turning to slide 16. Controlling capital and operating costs have remained a core tenet of our company's strategy as we continue to optimize DC&E costs, while expanding cash margins even in a low commodity price environment. We have recently signed a deal with a local sand provider that will enable us to save around 5% on current total well cost in the Midland Basin as well as secure low cost supply for multiple years. We expect to begin using this product in the Midland Basin and potentially shallow zones in the Delaware Basin in early 2018 as the mine comes online. Turning to slide 18, at $50 oil, and current capital and cash costs, the Lower Spraberry in the Midland Basin and the Wolfcamp A in the Southern Delaware Basin continue to display exceptional Tier 1 economics, which will compete for capital in our portfolio for years to come. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's second quarter 2017 net income was $1.61 per diluted share and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives was $1.25 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million, up 25% from Q1 2017, due to increased production and lower costs. During the quarter, our cash operating costs declined 18% relative to Q1 to $7.66 per BOE. This includes LOE of $4.14 and cash G&A cost of $0.82. With our exceptional performance on cash operating expenses, we are lowering LOE guidance by 19% and cash G&A by 33% from prior midpoint. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $157 million on drilling and completion and $18 million on infrastructure and non-operated property. As a result of continued efficiency and execution, we are lowering our CapEx guidance to $800 million to $950 million from $800 million to $1 billion previously. As shown on slide 20, Diamondback ended the second quarter of 2017 with a net debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times and $681 million of liquidity. Our full year 2017 production guidance presented on slide 21 was increased 5% from prior midpoint, while reducing CapEx guidance. Additionally, we will have decreased LOE, G&A as well as gathering and transportation guidance. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another great quarter as a result of our continued commitment to execution and low-cost operations. We are increasing production guidance while decreasing capital spend and cash operating cost for the year. We have the ability to differentially grow within cash flow for many years at nearly any commodity price given the strength of our Tier 1 inventory. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations to the team on really delivering two back-to-back outstanding quarterly results. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, John. John Nelson : The press release mentioned a determinant of future production growth will be returns to shareholders, Travis, just wondering if you can maybe elaborate on what that really means to you and how the team considers shareholder returns during the capital allocation process? Travis D. Stice: Sure. Well, I think the first metric that we look at is certainly go within cash flow and as we allocate capital within our ability to use operational cash flow, we look at the returns metrics as we compare different projects one to another. And we try to always allocate to those projects, which generate the highest rate of return. And we also take a more of a corporate look at it as well, certainly when we do M&A activities, the way we look at returns on a full cycle basis as well where we include the cost of everything that's embedded in the investment decision. And it's just a commentary that we're having internally, and it's one that we think is the right way to continue to drive shareholder value. John Nelson : Just maybe to follow-up on that. As you continue to kind of mature as a company, is there a certain inflection point when you think it might make sense for Diamondback to start paying a dividend or buying back shares, or is it just something that's always contemplated? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, certainly, John. We look at the way that we can grow within cash flow and we look at what the future years look like. And those type conversations, while we might have them internally, are still premature. We've got a lot of really outstanding wells to convert into cash flow, and we look forward to doing that for many years to come and to the extent we have those opportunities in the future, we'll have the conversations at that time. John Nelson : That makes a lot of sense. And I guess as my second question, last night, one of your peers highlighted the need for a fourth string of casing on the Midland Basin, particularly in Midland and Martin County is an area where there's more vertical depletion. I was wondering if you can just speak to, if that's something that you're seeing or what kind of the standard design is for some of your Midland Basin horizontal wells? Michael L. Hollis: Hey, John, across the Midland Basin, we run a three-string design, but again, as we drill through several of these counties in different zones, we encounter similar issues with losses and pressure. Again, it's just what we do each day, it's blocking and tackling. So again, we have our plan, and we execute the plan in each one of the areas and each one of the areas are slightly different as to where we set casing and whatnot. But currently, the three-string design is what we run across the entire Midland Basin side, as well as the Delaware Basin side at this time. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. John, all of our plans are three strings design. All the wells we've done historically have been three strings and as we plan the future going forward, there's three-string designs as well. John Nelson : Great. So not an issue that you all are seeing. All right. That's very helpful. I'll let someone else hop on. Congrats again. Travis D. Stice: Thanks John. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. You may proceed. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, guys. Travis, question, I think this \u2013 obviously that long-term agreements you guys signed and talked about here on the proppant supply looks very positive to save about 5%, could you talk about the potential for, I mean, I guess, number one, what percentage of just overall Midland production will this particular contract encompass, and is there prospects for more of these? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Neal. This is Kaes here. I don't want to give specific contract details, but I will say that we have the ability to flex up and down with the amount of spreads that we're running in the Midland Basin today as well as our projected use over the next couple of years. So, I think, one, this grants us a secure supply for almost as much as we need on the Midland Basin side. And two, it locks us in at a price that we're very happy with compared to current well cost today. Neal D. Dingmann: Got it. And one just last one. Somebody already asked on \u2013 as far as with the four-string case. I guess, my question, either, Travis, for you, or Mike, when you just look at sort of what the GOR, you all tend to continue to be a bit more stable than what I see from other companies in the area, is that anything particular what you're doing on the operations side, just the particular rocks that you're in or anything you can just talk about on your GOR expectations and what you've seen so far? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Neal, just a couple of points. We're very confident in how we forecast our business, whether it's reserves or CapEx, production, that's what we do. We spent a lot of technical time forecasting our wells, studying our type curves, understanding the reserves and how they're going to be produced, and we vet those externally with our reserve auditors. We believe we're going to continue to deliver on our growth and production forecast in the future, because we execute, that's what we do, and we're very confident in our future forecast. I know there's a lot of questions out there, but I can't stress enough that we're confident in how we execute on our forecast. It's what we do. Neal D. Dingmann: It's great to hear. Great quarter at the end, Travis, once again. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Neal. Operator : And our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. Drew E. Venker: Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about capital allocation decisions as we head into 2018, where you're thinking the most attractive areas of your Southern Delaware are and any changes in priority in the Midland Basin, I guess, you talked about multiple core areas on both sides of the Permian, but any updated thoughts there would be appreciated? Travis D. Stice: Sure. So we took over operations in March, and we're still trying to understand exactly what the return profile is going to look like for the Southern Delaware wells. As we underwrote the acquisition, we demonstrated, based on the data we had at hand, that the Wolfcamp A competed for capital from some of our better investment opportunities on the Midland Basin side. And so if that holds true and we expect it will, then you'll see us migrate more towards an equal allocation of activity on the Midland Basin side and the Delaware Basin side. But again, back to the question that John was asking earlier, we're going to continue to monitor the returns we are getting and we are going to allocate capital to the highest rate of return projects that are going to ensure that we generate the greatest corporate return. But as we understand it right now, we're going to continue to allocate pretty equally on both sides of the Basin, recognizing that we're still early in the game on the Delaware and it's going to take us a while to ramp up rig activity to equal what we have on the Midland Basin side. Drew E. Venker: That's helpful color, Travis. Appreciate that. And a little bit more on the Delaware Basin, if we could stay on that. Can you give us a sense of how much additional learning you think you could really benefit from in the Delaware Basin, because obviously it's still fairly new to a couple of those assets? And how much time you think you need to really hone in the design? Obviously, understanding that it's never going to be 100% there to perfection, but how much additional time do you think you need before you kind of settled on the design? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I'm pretty confident that with \u2013 we got over 4,500 wells in our inventory. I'm pretty confident that that 4,500th well, we're going to be doing something different than what we're doing today. The laboratory that we're in, we continue to evolve on a well-by-well basis, and we do that in the form of continuous learning. And that's I think anytime you find an organization that is demonstrating excellence, you'll see continuous learning. So every well is a laboratory. And every well, we plan it, we understand the results, we change our behaviors if necessary, and we do it again, and we continue that cycle over and over again. We're much more confident on the Midland Basin side because we've been there now for over five years. We've just moved into the Delaware Basin and we're trying to do that same process. I'll tell you though, Drew, just to give you an example, we talked about it in our release, that Second Bone Spring well. Now that was a well that was drilled and completed \u2013 drilled by Brigham and completed by Diamondback, and it was a zone that we ascribed just virtually no value to in the acquisition when we underwrote it. But yet it comes on now at a rate that's competitive, as Mike explained, because of the lower capital cost. It's competitive as we allocate capital. So that was something that it was just \u2013 I would say it's more than a nice surprise, and we've got still some work to do to define how much running room we have exactly in front of the Bone Springs. But we're always in a process of learning and the advantages that we've had in operating in the Midland Basin now for over five years, we believe that we can transfer that into the Delaware Basin, whether it's on the cost or the completion or any of the technical aspects of developing this reservoir, we're going to transfer that over to the Delaware, and we intend to operate the Delaware best-in-class, like we do on the Midland Basin side. Drew E. Venker: Thanks for that, Travis. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Glick with JPMorgan. You may proceed. Michael A. Glick: Morning, guys. In Pecos County, could you talk a bit about ESPs and specifically, when you're putting new wells on pump? And just on new wells, when do they typically reach peak production after flowing back? Travis D. Stice: Well, we've got a program underway right now. We put a dozen or so ESPs in the ground there and we saw quite a bit of success in the Midland Basin side when we did that on early time flow back characteristics. And we're testing that right now. It's still too early to say exactly whether or not it's going to be successful or not. But I'll tell you, we like the early returns on what we're seeing there. Michael A. Glick: Okay. And then it looks like you guys have already reduced drilling days in Pecos County. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? Michael L. Hollis: Hey, Michael, drivers on the Delaware side are no different than they are or they were on the Midland Basin side. It's just the daily bid selection, mud selection. It's one of the thousand decisions that are made daily that go into that. So it's just natural blocking and tackling that we're doing on the optimization front. So again it's just new rock. It's spatially very large over here with 100,000 acres. So there's little intricacy differences between each one of the areas. But again that's something that we do every day on the Midland Basin side. So we expect to see those same kind of improvements on the Delaware side. Travis D. Stice: Michael, when you look at our history of moving into a new area, typically it's always been on the Midland Basin side. But when we were first movers into the Martin County and started developing that horizontally, we took the initial well days to TD. And we took it down substantially. When we moved into Howard County, we did the same thing on our execution; we drove days down. And the same way in Glasscock County where we drove days down. And again if you go back to that continuous learning that I was talking about earlier, that's what we do. We focus on execution with a laser-like focus. And we learn from the things that we do and the way that it manifests itself in things that can be viewed externally, our lower well cost, higher cash margins, lower LOE and lower days to TD in the question that you just asked. Michael A. Glick: And then just lastly for me, on the Second Bone, any quantification of how you see costs shaking out in that zone, given its relative depth versus the Wolfcamp? Michael L. Hollis: Rough being 1,000 foot shallower and lower pressure, we're roughly $1 million cheaper on the lower Second Bone Spring wells versus the Wolfcamp A. Michael A. Glick: Got you. Travis D. Stice: And, Michael, that Second Bone Springs interval is about 400 to 500 feet thick, and I think it runs pretty much as we've got it mapped across the whole position. So again we can't get out in front of this thing, but it certainly has us pretty excited about the future development opportunities in that zone. Michael A. Glick: Got it. Thank you very much. Travis D. Stice: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. You may proceed. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. LOE continues to be impressive. When you look at that, the forecast being lowered this quarter, what is the biggest surprise there? Are you achieving better LOE over in the Delaware? Is that more Midland driven? Can you just provide a little bit more color regarding that? Travis D. Stice: Sure, Gail. Let me just tell you how proud I am of our operations organization for continuing to push the ball down the field on lower and lower cost. They've heard me say numerous times that we're not going to quit pushing until we can produce these wells for free. But really, we took over a new operations area this year in the Delaware Basin with 100,000 acres, and I'm just really proud of what we've been able to do to continue to drive cost down there. I'll say we probably were a little cautious in our early forecasting of expenses there because it was an unknown area, but they've done a really great job. And on the Midland Basin side, the guys have continued to do the things that you've got to do to execute as the best-in-class operator. We continue to monitor every month our well failure rates, whether they're on the rod pumps or the ESP and the guys have done a great job of continuing to reduce well failures, which ultimately drives lower cost as well. And then the other thing, when you're doing a ratio like dollars per barrel, really the best way to drive that lower is to work on the numerator and the denominator at the same time. And I think if you look quarter-over-quarter, our total cost on LOE, even after acquiring additional 100,000 acres in the Delaware, our total cost on LOE only moved up about 3% while our volumes quarter-over-quarter moved up 25%. So when you're working on the numerator and denominator at the same time, you get really good results. And like I said, I couldn't be more proud of our operations organization for their continued diligence and relentless focus on cost and expenses. Gail Nicholson : And then just jumping over to the Andrews County, the downspacing wells, you guys talked about those last quarter, and they were impressive on the 30-day rates, continue to compare favorably, when you (24:36 \u2013 24:41) across the system in Andrews County, maybe elsewhere, do you feel like that's the migration that you guys are going to move to? Or kind of where are you in that downspacing infill game? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I mean, that was the first three-well pad we've done at the 500-foot spacing in that northern area. We've got another downspacing test planned. So we'll just continue to monitor the results and just see where it shakes out. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Asit Sen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Asit. Asit Sen : So two unrelated question. First, very interesting slide on slide number 5, and thanks for the color on the scenario analysis. My question is, how does the frac crew cadence change for slide 5? And could you remind us regarding your exposure to spot versus dedicated crew? And on that slide, are we assuming cash flow neutrality? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. So from a frac crew perspective, it typically takes \u2013 for a 6-rig program it's going to take roughly two frac spreads. And so, you've got to do that ratio of 3 to 1 \u2013 three rigs to one frac crew. And so for running on rigs, you pretty much just assume we'll run a three frac crew \u2013 three frac spreads. And then specifically, Kaes, do you want to answer that on...? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, for any cash flow neutrality, I mean, really, this is kind of a look into the back half of our year, this year, and lightly into 2018, without giving formal guidance for 2018. Depending on your oil price for 2018, we can accelerate or decelerate as needed. So that's kind of our target rig counts in today's environment with our current asset base. Asit Sen : Okay. And the second question is, you just kind of touched upon it earlier, the opportunity to transfer Midland Basin best practices to Delaware Basin. And particular interest in the cost side of the business, looks like if I'm looking at the midpoint of completion cost per unit land at Delaware Basin, 550 (27:02) is roughly about 30% higher than Midland. Could you highlight the moving parts and the early opportunities that you see? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Certainly, the early opportunities are the things that Mike highlighted, just doing the blocking and tackling as he executes a continuous program, and that's taking days out of the how long it takes us to get to TD. Typical day, it's somewhere between $50,000 to maybe $70,000 a day. So saving days makes a big difference. But really, when you look at the depth of the Delaware Basin, and some of the pressure issues that Mike also highlighted earlier, that depth and pressure will always cause more dollars to be spent than what you're going to spend on an equivalent well on the Midland Basin side. So it's going to be more expensive drilling on the Delaware. But as we've highlighted on numerous calls, the fact that you have greater EURs per foot and rate of capture of those reserves associated with higher pressure, still generates an equivalent rate of return. Asit Sen : Great. And my last question here. On infrastructure spending 2017, I think it's $175 million, how should we think about 2018? Travis D. Stice: 2017 still going to stay in that $150 million to $175 million range, we spent about $30 million so far year-to-date. The back half of this year will be pretty evenly weighted on that remaining $120 million to $150 million. And then going into 2018, we're going to revert more back to our traditional 10% of total capital allocated to infrastructure with its just-in-time building of tank batteries, saltwater disposals, fresh water systems ,et cetera, as the large capital projects are completed in 2017. Asit Sen : Thank you, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. You may proceed. Jeff Grampp : Hey, guys. Just while we're on the topic of infrastructure there, can you guys maybe talk a little bit about the status of those build-out projects? I guess, it sounds like they're a little bit more back-half weighted. But can you just kind of give us a sense for how those are expected to roll out, and then if we should expect any material change to your cost structure as a result of those investments? Michael L. Hollis: Jeff, a lot of work in progress has already been done. It's the lag in the invoices coming in is what's driving it more to the back half weighted. Of course, we got the assets in March, so we got to work almost immediately on getting these infrastructure projects put in. It's just more of a timing of that cash flow out the door is what you're seeing, but there's nothing coming later in the year, it's just the process of getting all the pipe in the ground. Travis D. Stice: And then from a netback perspective, you'll see a little bit of a difference as these oil systems are in the ground, and they'll improve our Delaware netbacks. Jeff Grampp : Okay, that's helpful. And then on the well cost side, it looks to us that there was a bit of an uplift sequentially in Midland Basin well cost on a per-foot basis. I was wondering if you guys can maybe give us a sense for what the main drivers are on that. I'm assuming, it's on the pressure pumping side, but didn't know if that's maybe just kind of based on the completion methodologies you guys are rolling out. And if that was kind of expected within the budget, it seems like costs are may be expected to kind of level out there and just was hoping to get some color on how you guys are seeing cost playing throughout the remainder of the year there? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I think, Jeff, the way we see it, if you look at our cost per lateral foot in the Midland Basin, we're still well below the midpoint of our guidance for the year, $5 million to $5.5 million for a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Midland side. Really, the majority of that is pressure pumping and the pressure pumping industry has recovered in the past couple of months, in a couple of quarters and especially, in the last quarter. And I think there will be a lot of pressure pumping equipment coming on line, and we'll see where with that pricing shakes out in the back half of the year. But from a guidance perspective, we guided conservatively at the beginning of the year, anticipating some increases on the pressure pumping side. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Great. Appreciate your time guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason (sic) [John] (31:20) Aschenbeck with Seaport Global. You may proceed. John W. Aschenbeck: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Lot of the good ones have already been addressed, but did have one question in terms of organic leasing opportunities in the Southern Delaware. I noticed in the slide you added about 3,200 net acres during the quarter. I was wondering what the remaining opportunity set looks like in the area and how much further you think you can grow your acreage footprint there? And then kind of building on top of that, was curious if you're essentially buying out working interest partners or are you actually expanding your gross acreage footprint? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: That's really a combination. I think in the ReWard area, we did some add-ons. I also know that via trades, we've increased that working interest in the ReWard area from about 49% to almost over 75% today. So, really bringing value forward there. Down in the Brigham acreage in Pecos, buying out some working interest owners, and that's really what our land teams are driven to do, and is the blocking and tackling, so we can drill 10,000 foot laterals, ideally with as high a working interest as possible. John W. Aschenbeck: Got it, appreciate that. And then is it fair to think that that 3,000 a quarter is a good run rate or is there potential to boost that a little bit higher maybe? Travis D. Stice: Any opportunity that creates unreasonable value for Diamondback shareholders, we will try to take advantage of. John W. Aschenbeck: All right. Fair enough. And then one more for me, in terms of upcoming test on the Brigham acreage, I was just curious if you have any additional completion scheduled from that Southeastern-most block in Pecos, and if so, when should we expect the timing of those? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. On the Southeast block, we don't have anything planned until those leases are due to come up in the next couple years. So you'll see us drilling in the Main Block of primarily Wolfcamp A wells. John W. Aschenbeck: Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. You may proceed. Jason A. Wangler: Morning. Was just curious on the well counts as you look at the horizontal wells completed, it moved down a little bit, just the function there. And then as you look at the drilling side of it, do you still expect to have quite a few wells then waiting on completion at the end of the year? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think if you looked at our cadence, we drilled 34 for the quarter, completed 35. Back half of the year, if you look at the midpoint of our new guide, really we're going to complete about 30 to 35 wells a quarter for the next two quarters. So we'll probably maintain very close to the pace that we had in Q2, maybe a little bit of acceleration in Q3 and Q4, as we picked up the ninth rig in May. And we'll start completing some wells there in this quarter. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. And just on the sand contract, can you just talk about how much of the regional sand you guys have been using historically in the Midland or even Delaware. It sounds like that's early days? And obviously it sounds like you're pretty much going to shift entirely to that as you go to 2018, just kind of the experience you guys have had there? Kaes Van' t Hof : We haven't used any of it yet. The plant comes online that we're going to be working with in Q1 of next year. We've done a significant amount of third-party testing. And all indications point towards this being a sand that's capable of being run in anything in the Midland Basin and everything shallow in the Delaware. So we'll dip our toe in the water as we always do in Q1 of next year. And all indications are pointing towards this being a cost saving and high-quality product. Jason A. Wangler: Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back. Travis D. Stice: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Tim Rezvan with Mizuho. You may proceed. Timothy A. Rezvan: Hi. Thanks. As all my questions have been addressed, so I'll step off. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeb Bachmann with Scotia Howard Weil. You may proceed. Joseph Bachmann : Hey, everyone. So I guess the last answer addressed my question is that this is the Monahan Mine that you guys were referring to earlier with the same deal with Black Mountain? Travis D. Stice: Correct. Joseph Bachmann : And then, I guess, up in Howard County, just curious how the design implementations to lower the de-watering time period, how that's helped you guys in the quarter and your chances to improve that going forward? Michael L. Hollis: Jeb, again we've done a lot of things as far as landing of the wells, spacing stack stagger as well as the completion cadence, how we complete, whether it's the staggering of the A and the B in the Lower Spraberry completions as we move back in (36:14) these wells. We're doing a lot of things right now to try to eliminate or reduce some of the water that we have up in Howard County. And even with that said, the water content is typically up in the 2 times the oil ratio. So again still not excessive water. So but again everything that we've done has increased the oil production and reduced some of the water \u2013 oil/water ratio that we're seeing up in the Howard County area. Joseph Bachmann : All right. Great. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Geoff Jacques with IBERIA Capital Partners. You may proceed. Geoff Jacques : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to elaborate on a prior question with the reduction in those wells with the updated guidance, is the majority of the change coming from Midland or the Delaware? Michael L. Hollis: Geoff, most of the change has just come from not picking up our tent. When we set guidance early in the year, end of last year, it was a 6 to 10 rig kind of range. And as we've gone through the year, we've picked up the ninth rig and that looks like the cadence that we're most likely going to run at this commodity price. So moving out that tenth rig and not bringing it in earlier in the year, which was kind of what built that upper end of the cadence range for us. That's really all that drove that. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. You'll see us run six rigs and three rigs at today's cadence in the Midland and Delaware respectively. I also think average lateral length is going to be a little bit longer in the back half of the year as we completed some DUCs on the Brigham acreage that were under 5,000 feet. So everything in the back half of the year is closer to that 9,000-foot lateral length on average, which is going to benefit. Geoff Jacques : Got it, got it. That makes sense. And then, at Howard, was there something about the Bullfrog design that is causing it to outperform some of the other wells that you guys have laid out? Travis D. Stice: I mean, we completed those wells in a similar fashion to the other wells. I mean, we actually think there's something geologically going on in that area that enhanced the results from those wells. Geoff Jacques : Got you. All right, thanks. Appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Thanks Geoff. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. You may proceed. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious on the Pecos side and sorry if any of this has been addressed. I had some phone issues, I had to drop off. But the dual zone development in the Wolfcamp A on the Neal Lethco wells, like, what's the game plan in terms of moving forward? Is that kind of the development plan for the Wolfcamp A moving forward to come out with dual development in the A, or what additional tests do you have on horizon to continue to pursue that? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. I mean, we've got a couple of pads that we're drilling right now in Pecos that we're doing that stagger as well. So, you know, we're testing the results with the idea that we can tighten down the spacing between wells with that stagger. So, you know, ultimately you have more wells and higher recovery of the oil out of that Wolfcamp A. And so we'll continue on with the testing and hopefully it will work out and our inventory will go up. Michael Anthony Hall : Fair enough. So just to make sure, I understand. So like, you've got a couple of pads for the rest of the year and maybe we'd get data on early next year, let's say, but kind of the rest of the development program in Pecos is on a kind of single well in the zone? And have you identified like the landing zones that you think is most optimal? I know that's been a question in the past in the Pecos asset. Just kind of wondering where you're at on that group (40:33). Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I mean, really all the \u2013 essentially, all the upcoming wells in all of the Pecos acreage are multi-well pads. Depending on lease obligations and some leases, a few leases will be drawn on Wolfcamp B wells, the whole acreage. So there will be a Wolfcamp A and a Wolfcamp B, but the majority of them are going to be two wells in the Wolfcamp A and as we test different areas of that large acreage block, not everyone will be the same. But, in general, early on, we'll do the staggered pattern to get some better early time results on that pattern. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. That's helpful. Understood. And I was just curious on the quarter itself, I know you don't necessarily, you don't have quarterly guidance per se, but it's a very, very strong quarter relative to estimates and just seemed like I would think a solid quarter internally as well. So how would you kind of attribute the performance in the quarter across the assets and within the various factors on the assets, well performance, downtime, timing of wells et cetera. Just kind of curious how you attribute the well \u2013 the quarterly performance. Travis D. Stice: Michael, at the end of \u2013 or actually it was in the third quarter, end of third quarter of 2016 when we started ramping up our activity levels, and we actually entered into 2017 with all the high spec rigs we needed, we had all the frackers that we wanted and we were really coming in, executing at the very top of our game. And I think you've seen that over the last couple of quarters is that we didn't guide for the year of back-half weighted activity levels. We said, hey, we're good and we're steady and we've got exactly what we want. And I think what you're seeing in our quarterly performance is a direct result of our ability to execute. We touched just about everything this quarter and we still have work in front of us and we still got challenging wells to drill, but I'm very confident in Diamondback's organization to be able to execute. And I don't think you've ever heard me speak privately or publicly without some direct reference to our ability to execute at low-cost operations because in a commodity-based business like we're in, that's how you win the game, and that's what we talk about multiple times a day here and we're going to continue to talk about that going forward in the future. Michael Anthony Hall : That makes sense. And I guess in that framework or in that context, I can't help but think about M&A. You guys are, as you said, proving yourself time and again to be a superior operator in the Basin, which suggests you should be able to be a superior acquirer, which you have been in the past. You've had some time to digest these Delaware assets. I'm just curious what the appetite is from Diamondback for additional acquisitions or M&A from this point forward? Travis D. Stice: We've said before that if we can do accretive deals that create a reasonable value for our shareholders we're going to continue to do that because we believe we can assimilate and we believe our track record shows we can assimilate acquisitions into our inventory and continue to execute on. And so as long as deals are out there, we're always going to do accretive deals and we're always going to do smart deals that make a lot of money for our investors. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Robertson with Barclays You may proceed. Jeffrey Robertson : Thanks. Just one question on the infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. Can you talk about how the completion of that will affect your 2018 program there, if at all. I think that you said the target is going to be the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A, but also can you talk to the direction of costs in the Delaware Basin that that infrastructure will have? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. On the infrastructure side the SWD systems are in place right now to handle all the activity that we need on a go-forward basis and we'll keep drilling saltwater disposal wells as more of a just-in-time type deal. On the oil gathering side, oil gathering systems should be in place by the end of this year early next year and that that will improve netbacks, but it's not going to impact our plans over the next 12 months to continue accelerating in the Delaware Basin. Jeffrey Robertson : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks, again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Simon. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's third quarter 2017 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's third quarter 2017 conference call. Over the past five years as a publicly-traded company, Diamondback has operated by three core principles : best-in-class execution, low-cost operations and transparency, while concurrently maintaining strict capital discipline. The third quarter was no different for Diamondback as we continued to deliver on each of these principles. This foundation of our business strategy, along with our attractive acreage position and strong operations-focused organization, allows us to grow production differentially within cash flow at nearly any commodity price. Capital discipline and operating within cash flow are not new concepts at Diamondback, as we have grown production by over 175% in the last 11 quarters within operating cash flow. The company has never been about growth for growth's sake, and management is not rewarded for growth, but rather rewarded for capital efficiency and cost control. We are operating nine rigs today, six in the Midland Basin and three in the Southern Delaware Basin, as well as operating four dedicated completion crews. We plan to add a tenth rig in the coming weeks and maintain this rig cadence until year-end, given current commodity prices. As we look ahead into 2018, we will match operating cash flow to drilling and infrastructure CapEx and increase or decrease rig count accordingly, just like we have done historically. As shown on slide 6, Diamondback has had a consistent focus on corporate returns and full-cycle economics. The industry commentary has pivoted recently, but Diamondback has always emphasized that returns matter, as evidenced by generating an average return on capital employed of over 8% for each of the past four quarters and a peer-leading production for debt adjusted share growth over 130% since the second quarter of 2014. With these comments now complete, I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. Turning to slide 8, year-to-date, Diamondback has generated $84 million of free cash flow and has maintained capital discipline of operating near cash flow break-even for 11 quarters. Diamondback plans to maintain this level of capital discipline in the coming years, adding rigs as cash flow allows. Slide 9 shows our average lateral length completed over time as well as the number of wells drilled and completed each quarter. Diamondback continues to drill and complete wells as efficiently as possible with four completion crews currently running across our asset base and average lateral lengths completed up 20% quarter-over-quarter. As shown on slide 11, we have controlled well cost under $700 per completed lateral foot in the Midland Basin year-to-date, while maintaining industry-leading cash margins of 80%. We are continuing to work to mitigate service cost inflations by increasing efficiencies, drilling longer laterals across the Basin and de-bundling services, particularly on the pressure pumping side of the business. Turning ahead to slide 14, we have new data from multiple well results across our Southern Delaware Basin assets, including two 90-day IPs that demonstrate the strong extended performance of wells in the area. Our first operated Lower Second Bone Spring well continues to exceed expectations, and as a result, we are evaluating additional tests of this zone in 2018. We are currently running three rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin and plan to have our new operated rig move there after drilling its first pad in the Midland Basin. We continue to maximize netbacks by building and upgrading infrastructure across the asset base. Turning to the Midland Basin, we are currently running six rigs and plan to maintain this cadence. Slide 17 shows the continued impressive performance from our assets in Howard and Andrews County, with wells in both areas continuing to outperform reserve auditor type curves. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's third quarter 2017 net income was $0.74 per diluted share and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives was $1.33 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $232 million, up 6% quarter-over-quarter with cash operating costs of $7.67 per BOE. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $225 million on drilling, completion and non-operated properties, and $33 million on infrastructure. Year-to-date, we have generated $84 million of free cash flow, excluding acquisitions. As shown on slide 19, Diamondback ended the third quarter of 2017 with a net debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times and $791 million of pro forma liquidity. In connection with our Fall 2017 redetermination expected to close in November, the lead bank on our credit facility recommended a borrowing base increase to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion. The company will elect an increase in commitment to $1 billion from the current elected commitment of $750 million. Additionally, Viper expects to have its borrowing base increased to $400 million from $315 million currently. Our full year 2017 production guidance, presented on slide 20, was increased 3% from prior midpoint while narrowing CapEx guidance. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another great quarter as a result of our continued commitment to execution and low-cost operations. We are increasing production guidance while maintaining capital spend and cash operating costs for the year. As we look forward to 2018, our strategy has not changed and that we expect to match our capital budget to our projected operating cash flow and have the ability to differentially grow within cash flow for many years at nearly any commodity price. Before we open the line for questions, I want to make one final comment. This past October, Diamondback celebrated the five-year anniversary of our IPO. In these five years as a public company, we've grown from a couple of dozen employees to now over 250 and from a couple thousand barrels a day of production to now over 85,000 barrels a day. To our employees who were here in the early days, we'll always be indebted to your loyalty; and to our employees who have joined us over the past years, we've successfully built an amazing company with a future that remains bright because of the collection of your individual talents, hard work, trust, determination, and perseverance. Thanks to each of you for what you've done. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons/Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. David Kistler : Good morning, guys. Real quickly, on slide 4 you guys highlight how activity may move in different price regimes. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys think about that when thinking about balancing growth and return on capital versus return of capital going forward? In other words, is there a point at which you elect not to increase rig count within cash flow, but rather return cash flow to shareholders? Travis D. Stice: Dave, that's a great question, one that we model consistently going out into the future. And I think the right way to think about it is we believe the best way to generate that excess free cash flow is to get to a rig cadence of somewhere around 15 to probably 18 rigs. And I think the right way to think about that is any discretionary cash flow that's created, think about it being redeployed until we get to that rig cadence. Once you get to that rig we feel like is the maximum efficiency on our current acreage footprint, then we can have conversations about true return of capital. But it's certainly something that, in the not-too-distant future, our model shows that we'll be able to have those conversations. David Kistler : Great, I appreciate that color. And then looking at the Second Bone Spring, and in your presentation, you talk about the existing plan has been four wells per section, but that Kelley State well would maybe indicate that there's a possibility for prosecuting that interval with both an upper and a lower series of wells. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that, timing of watching those wells, the extra work you're doing on that, and when that might allow you guys to make a decision for adding incremental inventory? Travis D. Stice: Dave, historically, we've not been part of the story about trying to add a ton of locations every quarter call and feed the NAV machine. We've tried to be very conservative in the way that we communicate locations, and we're doing a lot of science still on this pretty exciting horizon, but yet still one that we don't have a lot of data on. S, we're going to be drilling a well this year and before the year end, and we'll look to have that well completed early next year. And we'll be able to communicate more about how we view the development of that asset probably in our May-ish \u2013 May timeframe. And I think it's important to remember that as we underwrote the Brigham acquisition, we put the majority of the value on the Wolfcamp A. So while it's not unrecognized, it's probably unrealized upside in our acquisition model that has us pretty excited. And the reason for that is because it's a little shallower and it's still slightly over-pressured, but it's a lot easier to drill. And the cost we believe is going to mirror real closely to what we see on the Midland Basin side. So it will give us \u2013 when we allocate capital, gives us a really good horizon. But there's still some work left to be done, Dave. David Kistler : Great, I appreciate that, and one last one for me. I noticed that Delaware well costs crept up a little bit or at least the guidance on that crept up a little bit. Can you talk about what you're doing differently there, or is that purely just a little bit of service cost inflation that's creeping in? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Dave. Kaes here. We're trying a couple things. We went into the year new to the Delaware Basin, so came in with a pretty wide guide on well costs. I will say in the back half of this year, we've done a lot more 2,500-pound per foot jobs on the sand side versus 2,000 pounds per foot in the beginning of the year, and with that comes extra fluid as well. So extra fluid, extra sand, and extra time on location on the completion side has really driven that cost up. I will say our drilling guys continue to decrease days on location and increase cycle times on the drilling side, so we've seen improvement there on the cost side. It's just trying a bigger stim as we figure out our mix going forward. David Kistler : Great, I appreciate the added color, guys. Thanks so much and good work. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, all. Travis, my first question, looking at slide 5, I thought that was a good new slide that you all have out. Could you talk about, on that, just basically going through your assumed spacing assumptions there? You certainly seem \u2013 much like other things you all do, you seem more conservative than others on a number of formations there. Any color you could add to either side as far as how you think about that today versus what we can maybe see in 2018? Travis D. Stice: Neal, you've studied us now for five years, and you know that typically we try to be conservative in the way we communicate things like number of locations per section. And what we like to do is add locations, not take them away. And we like to have when we add locations, not only the science done that proves that clearly in our own mind, but also in the minds of our reserve auditors. And so I think you're going to continue to hear Diamondback conservatively talk about the number of locations. Again, back to my comments about what we've done historically has not been trying to drive the NAV machine through location adds every quarter. I think what we've done is generate really high returns on a full-cycle basis and things that matter like return on capital employed and debt-adjusted cash flow per share, I think we stand pretty unique in that inspection. Neal D. Dingmann: And then lastly, Travis, could you talk just on leasing, both a little bit on what you see on potentially you and Kaes and the team on M&A, and then if just any of your locations you see you potentially might be writing off? Travis D. Stice: From a leasing perspective, we continue to actively bolt on and trade in all areas. Each land team treats an area as their own little BD department, so we're excited with the small amount of deals we've done, but they definitely increased lateral length and working interests in areas that, for instance, in the ReWard area, we bought it at a 49% working interest and now we're up into the high 70s, so essentially bringing half a rig of value forward. On the larger M&A side, it's been tough to see a lot of Tier 1 properties available in 2017. I think from our perspective, we're very focused on buying something that's immediately accretive to, one, cash flow per share and, two, our overall asset base. And we really haven't seen that across the Permian in 2017. Neal D. Dingmann: Perfect. Thank you all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : Good morning, and congratulations to the team on another outstanding quarter in a challenging operating environment. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. John Nelson : Travis, I was wondering if you can comment just on maybe some of the layer tightness you are, kind of, are not seeing within the Basin between yourselves and your service providers? I know you talk about kind of getting to a target of 15 to 18 rigs longer-term being optimal, do you think the organization is already kind of staffed at those levels? Where have we come from a staffing level, kind of, year-to-date? And any sort of labor pass-throughs maybe you're seeing from some of your service providers, things along those lines. That would be helpful. Travis D. Stice: Sure. I think, John, our industry has demonstrated in times past when commodity price starts to move, you start hearing your business partners on the service-side start to ask for rate increases, so they can build their working capital. And look, we want our business partners to be successful, we want them to continue to build new equipment and crew that new equipment with qualified staff. And so it's part of our business cycle and we anticipate some increases this year, as we've earlier guided. I think our total well cost, we talked about an increase of 5% on the total well cost for the year, and that was taking some of those comments under consideration. When you look internally for Diamondback, I mentioned we're going to pick ten rigs up. We're very comfortably staffed for ten rigs right now, and as long as we build our rig fleet every three to five months as we generate enough free cash flow to cash flow that rig, we're not going to have internal constraints. It's incumbent upon Diamondback's leadership team to always make sure we've got the right number of people to prosecute our plan. At about this time last year, we had about 160 employees, and now we're up to a little over 250. So we've gone through likely an unprecedented growth in our company's history, but we feel very comfortable where we sit today to be able to prosecute our plan with ten rigs. And we'll continue to find the best athletes in the draft, and we'll add those players accordingly. John Nelson : That's really helpful. And I guess my second question, again, a little bit higher level, but just curious how much has the internal kind of debate really bought into the recent strength in oil prices? I appreciate the comments that we'll spend within cash flow in 2018, but I'd imagine your estimate of where that will be now versus where it was in July has changed pretty materially. So if you could just speak to how you will potentially protect to make sure that you spend within cash flow, whether it's additional hedging or just a wider guidance range for us. But any thoughts on that would be helpful. Travis D. Stice: Sure. I'll let Kaes here in a second talk about what our hedging strategy is and remind the audience, but let me talk about strategically about how we think about commodity price as we run our business out. We've always used a conservative price, conservative to probably strip, and I think that does a couple of things for us organizationally. When you run a lower commodity price, I believe it forces a discipline within the decision-makers and the asset teams as they allocate capital because the lower commodity price focuses I think the organization on making sure we're doing everything at the highest rate of return. And the second thing is if we miss on oil price because oil price is actually higher, then we generate free cash flow. And as I've talked about earlier, we know what we're going to do with free cash flow until we get to somewhere in that 15 to 18-rig cadence on our existing acreage base. And then I'll let Kaes answer \u2013 remind everybody what our strategy is on hedging. Kaes Van' t Hof : And so one other point, John, we plan our business below strip, and right now at current production on an annualized basis, every dollar of price gives us about $30 million of cash flow. So it gives us a lot of protection on adding those rigs at the right time. And then back to hedging, we continue to protect what we think is the minimum drilling required to maintain our leasehold across both basins. And right now on a 12-month forward basis that's probably a five-rig cadence. So we basically look at our swaps and multiply them by the oil price that we have protected, and right now average price over $50 and look to protect about five rigs for the next 12 months. John Nelson : That's very helpful. Congrats again on the quarter. I'll let someone else hop on. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew E. Venker: Good morning, everyone. Travis, I was hoping you could just about how much of your capital allocation is driven by logistics and midstream considerations versus just rates of return? You've had some really strong results across the whole portfolio in the Delaware this quarter, some really outstanding results. And it looks like the core legacy position to the Midland Basin performing very strong as well. But just curious if you see material limitations there, or really can run as fast as you want across a lot of the areas you have? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Drew. Yeah, on the Midland Basin side, I'll divide it into the Midland and the Delaware. On the Midland Basin side, we can really run as fast as we need to now. I think we were fortunate through the down-cycle to build some infrastructure to be able to flow barrels on the freshwater side or the disposal side and make sure we can operate at a high rig cadence on the Midland Basin. And on the Delaware, we've been running three rigs. Our fourth rig is going to move out there sometime in early 2018. We anticipate the major infrastructure items that we had budgeted this year to be complete by the end of Q1, and then really, it's off to the races and we can add rigs as we see fit on the Delaware side as well. So a pretty high infrastructure spend for us this quarter and probably into next, and then after that we will return to a more standard infrastructure spend as a percentage of total capital. Drew E. Venker: Okay, that's helpful. And just a follow-up to the plan for next year, in the Delaware you've had some really strong results in Bone Spring in addition to the Wolfcamp A. Can you speak to what the delineation plans are for next year or how you plan to size up that resource over the next 12 months or so? Kaes Van' t Hof : The majority of our capital will still be spent on Wolfcamp A looking into next year on the Delaware side. We are very encouraged by the Second Bone Spring, so you should see some tests in the first half of 2018. I also anticipate some Third Bone Spring results probably in the Reeves County area throughout the year and maybe a couple Wolfcamp B tests. But the vast majority of our capital in the Delaware will be spent on the Wolfcamp A. Drew E. Venker: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning; Travis, just two broad questions for you. Could you speak broadly as to how you view the oil service market today? And your view \u2013 and this is not just FANG, but your view on how things change in a $55-plus world? Travis D. Stice: Asit, we can't really predict service constraints, but what we do expect that we're going to be first in line in terms of the additional needs that we have with our business partners on that side. As I mentioned before, we continue to see \u2013 as commodity price goes up, we see our business partners on the service side requesting, at some points, price increases. But I think it's important to note that it hasn't been an impediment to our growth. We've still been able to grow even with the increases in price. Asit Sen : Okay. And since we have you on, Travis, I wanted to hear your thoughts on the industry debate on Permian production growth in 2018. Could we be disappointed on that? What are your views on that today? Travis D. Stice: There's a lot of really smart people that study total production coming out of the Permian. I think past performance is a good indication of what goes on in the future. And I think if you just look at what's happened in 2017, particularly in 2Q and 3Q releases, I think you've seen some operators, not Diamondback, but you've seen some in the industry having trouble prosecuting their plan. And if commodity price continues to rise and some of these constraints that people are talking about surface, then there's a possibility to probably surprise to the downside. But again, there's a lot more intelligent people that study that macro view than Diamondback. But what Diamondback focuses on is how we can accurately put a forecast together that grows our production in the future with a high degree of confidence and can do so within cash flow. Asit Sen : All right. And my last macro question, Travis, I promise I'll stop there, is your thoughts on broader M&A in the Permian. Travis D. Stice: I think Kaes commented on that a little bit earlier as well. You're just not seeing a lot of what we call Tier 1 properties in the marketplace. And Diamondback is very confident that we can grow for many years in the future with what our current inventory is, although I do have a responsibility from a business development perspective to continue to look for deals that are going to be accretive to our shareholders. And I've said in the past that our fingerprints should be on every trade that occurs out in the Permian Basin, and I think you're either in that game of business development or you're not. And we continue to be active in looking for opportunities. But with the high-quality inventory that we have, we don't feel necessarily compelled to do something unless it's really a great return for our shareholders. Asit Sen : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning, everyone. Can you talk about how important landing zone is in regards to well performance? And in regards to the high-resolution 3-D seismic shoot that you guys are doing that you'll get in 2018, do you think that will help better land wells to improve well performance, or do you think that's more in regards to maybe proving up some maybe incremental zone potential across the Delaware Basin? Travis D. Stice: Gail, I'll probably let Paul answer the specifics about the high-res 3-D seismic, but let me just give you a broad view of how we think about it, the landing zone. In the Midland Basin, where we've got close to 300 wells drilled now, we feel very confident of the right landing zone and we have for quite some time, and we very efficiently geosteer within probably a 20-foot window, and we're in zone 98% of the time on the Midland Basin side. It's a little different as we move over into the Delaware Basin where we; one, we don't have the vertical well control; and two, quite honestly, we don't have the industry experience or the Diamondback experience in exactly the right zones. So part of the reason that Kaes intimated that our costs in the Delaware Basin, the midpoint of which is moving just a little bit, is because we don't have confidently identified exactly where the best landing zone is for some of these different horizons we're testing. And, Paul, can you answer specifically about what we anticipate the $8.5 million high-res shoot that we're doing will help us with? Paul S. Molnar: Right. We're participating in a spec shoot of 385 square miles, where we think it covers essentially all of our assets in the Southern Delaware. We're really excited about it, state-of-the-art, high-resolution seismic. To your question, it's a yes to both as far as better delineating the landing zone in the zones that's we're already targeting and also better delineating potential in additional zones that we've targeted. As far as we know, there's upside there, but we just don't have as much data. In the Midland Basin, most of our assets we're drilling between vertical wells on essentially 80-acre spacing. So it's much easier to geosteer. And the seismic \u2013 we do have some seismic in the Delaware and it's been very helpful in steering the wells that we've drilled to date. But we're excited about the new data set and relatively cheap cost that we're getting it to really help us high-grade zones and additional \u2013 or help us in the geosteering. Travis D. Stice: Great. And then you guys have talked about you're seeing a significant production uplift following utilizing ESP versus gas lift over in the Delaware. I was wondering can you quantify the delta between ESP versus gas lift. Travis D. Stice: Probably not yet, although we \u2013 I ask the guys routinely because it costs more to run these ESPs, I make sure I know how much incremental oil I have to produce to pay for the cost of running those ESPs. But did we put a slide in the deck, Mike, on ESP performance? No. So we have \u2013 we track that internally, Gail, and that's probably for future dissemination. But when we run these ESPs, we are seeing an uplift and the uplift is paying for the cost of ESPs. So I think that's the right way to think about it until we can communicate more details. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. I'm going to sneak in one last one. In regards to the completions, you're averaging about 1,500 feet per day in the Midland and 1,000 feet in the Delaware. Are you guys going to be able to, as you get more efficient in the Delaware, as you move up that learning curve move towards that 1,500 feet as you're in the Midland? Or is there always going to be a gap between how much you can do in a day on the completion standpoint? Michael L. Hollis: Hey, Gail. This is Mike. The difference between the Midland and the Delaware side is not so much the efficiency of the frac crews. They're all running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and they have the same kind of maintenance schedule. But really the difference, as Kaes alluded to earlier, is on the size of the job. So as we optimize and continue to optimize the jobs on the Delaware side, we're up to about 2,500 pounds per foot. And that may \u2013 we may over time \u2013 and again, as things change in cost, we may come down a little bit on the size, and that would allow us to pump the jobs a little faster. But as we continue to have the difference in size between the Midland and the Delaware, you'll continue to have the difference in the amount of footage we can complete because the job is just that much bigger. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jason A. Wangler: Hey. Good morning. Travis, just curious as you talk about \u2013 looks like you're going to kind of be four rigs and six rigs in the two basins. As you think about either next year or even as you get to that 15 rigs to 18 rigs level, how do you see that split kind of breaking down in the longer-term? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I think as Kaes alluded to earlier that as we continue to build out our infrastructure and allow us to produce our total fluid barrels in oil and gas more efficiently by having the midstream structure and the midstream facilities in place, you will continue to see more rigs migrate towards the Delaware side. But we just want to make sure that when we bring the rigs over there that we're able to produce those barrels as efficiently as we can which means we got to have all those midstream infrastructure expenditures down. So ultimately, we think about, from a capital allocation perspective, both areas are returning the same return metrics that you'll have equal rigs on either side. Jason A. Wangler: Okay. So it's more the infrastructure than anything else. Okay. And then just you picked up some acreage across the plays. Just maybe \u2013 obviously you talked about the M&A side being \u2013 kind of changing, but just on being able to pick up some acreage on bolt-on small things, is that still something that you're able to, obviously, do at a pretty decent clip, it looks like, based on what you did in the third quarter? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Those deals are really negotiated at the asset team level and that stuff they do day in and day out, and they do it strategically in advance of the drilling schedule. And you really can't predict on a quarterly basis what the asset teams are going to be able to do. But it's just smart business. We need to know not only everything about our own leasehold, but we need to know everything about what touches our leasehold and knowing that that drives business development opportunities. And I think our teams do a really good job at what we call Little A. Big A we handle at the business development levels. The Little A, which is these bolt-ons, the asset teams do a really good job of bringing those opportunities forward. Jason A. Wangler: I agree. Thanks. I'll turn it back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Grampp : Good morning, guys. I had a question on kind of lateral length here on slide five. Really appreciate that slide detail. And clearly longer laterals in the Midland but obviously appreciate that you guys have kind of worked on that over the last couple years and already 1.5 mile-ish in the Delaware. But wondering, is the Delaware configurated such, or do you have the potential to potentially get that to the 8,500-ish feet that the Midland's at? Or should we just not expect that to potentially be the case. Just trying to get a handle on that. Michael L. Hollis: Hey, Jeff. This is Mike. Absolutely. So the acreage we have up in the Northern portion of the Southern Delaware near the river, most of the river tracks are all plus 10,000-foot lateral lengths. As we go down into the acreage, we acquired from Brigham, a lot of that we had some legacy portions that were 7,500 feet but most everything going forward we're setting up for 10,000-foot lateral lengths. So 10,000-foot is going to kind of be the norm. The exceptions will be 7,500-foot or close to that. So we're looking for somewhere closer to that 8,500 to 9,000-foot as kind of the average going forward. Travis D. Stice: As we continue to trade in the Pecos asset, only acquiring it eight to ten months ago, we'll continue to increase the lateral length there as our team continues to trade and block that up. Jeff Grampp : Okay, perfect. And then as a follow up on a similar topic. Have you guys kind of identified, I guess, an efficient frontier on lateral lengths both on the Midland and Delaware side? I don't know if those are necessarily different conversations that need to be had, but just wondering as far as if there's any changes on EUR per foot and obviously tying that with efficiencies on the well cost side, or is it really nearly a just technology issue of getting as far as you guys are comfortable at from as far as where technology stands today? Travis D. Stice: Jeff, there's a couple questions embedded there and I'll kind of try to get to each one of them. The difference between the Midland and Delaware Basins, there are a few differences in that on the Delaware side we do move more fluid in these wells. So the 10,000-foot companywide seems to be about the most efficient that we're looking at today. But definitely on the Delaware side 10,000 foot is about as far as we want to push. Just being able to move that amount of fluid from a 10,000 foot well with the well deliverability we have in the Delaware, that 10,000 foot looks about right. As we go to the Midland Basin side, we have several wells that are plus that 13,500-foot to almost 14,500-foot lateral length. So going to 15,000-foot from a technical standpoint is very doable. From an efficient frontier standpoint, we still feel we have most of the field set up just from a lease geometry standpoint for 10,000 footers, but 15,000 footers are very doable on the Midland Basin side. Jeff Grampp : All right. Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One. Your line is open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Travis, nice quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Richard. Richard Merlin Tullis : You're welcome. You talked a little earlier about adding the 10th rig in the coming week. I just wanted to verify. Are you planning at this point to add an 11th rig early next year at the current oil price? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think we're happy to have a discussion. I don't think we're there yet, but we definitely plan our business in the $50 world. And in the $50 world, we're adding rig 11 at some point in 2018. I think in a $55 world, where we are today, that's just going to happen a little sooner. So we had the conversations on rig 10 probably 30, 45 days ago and that rig is now starting to work around this time. And we're consistently updating our budget based on oil price and our projected operating cash flow and planning our business ahead with that respect. So conversations are happening, but I can't commit to any timeframe yet into 2018. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thanks, Kaes. And looking longer term, if oil price gets to a sustained level that calls for running 15 to 18 rigs on the current acreage, how would that impact the company's ability operationally to handle larger acquisitions going forward? Travis D. Stice: You want to build the organization appropriately to handle the 15 to 18 rigs. And as I said, we're suited now to run the 10 rigs. So to get to 15 to 18 rigs, we'd be building the organization accordingly. At some point in time, these larger acquisitions are going to have to start coming with people. Again, from a business development perspective, we don't see a lot of big deals out there that fit within our Tier 1 threshold. So ultimately, that's our responsibility as leaders to make sure the business development takes everything into consideration, and one of those things that we consider is human capital. So it's what we do, Richard, so it wouldn't be an impediment to doing a deal. Richard Merlin Tullis : Okay, that's helpful, Travis. And that's all for me. I appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Thank you, folks. Good morning. If we could revisit the subject of paying a dividend, do you see paying a dividend as the ultimate point of distinction in the sector that is either a producer can generate sufficient and consistent free cash flow to return to shareholders or it can't? Travis D. Stice: I don't know, Dan, about the whole industry. What I'm going to focus on is what Diamondback has done. The commentary that I've mentioned has pivoted in the last six weeks to living within cash flow. That's not a new commentary for Diamondback. I've tried to illustrate that for 11 quarters now. If you add what we've spent in 11 quarters versus the operating cash flow, we've actually generated more operating cash flow. So I don't know where the discipline is going to go from an investor perspective, but Diamondback very clearly believes that returns matter and capital discipline is part of our DNA. It's what we've always done. And I think that's the right way to run a business now that we've grown so much as a company. It's fundamentally the right way to think about the future. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Got it. I appreciate the context and the honest answer. And if we could just revisit your remarks about other operators having trouble prosecuting their plans, those same producers have suffered from production slippage that maybe comes from new and less experienced stands in the field. It appears Diamondback hasn't suffered the same. Here's an obvious question for you. Why hasn't Diamondback suffered the same? And how is the company somewhat immune to what could be a tighter market for labor and services? Michael L. Hollis: Dan, I'll take this one. I think there's a relentless focus from our organization on execution, and you hear that in every quarterly call. I don't necessarily like to talk about other operators, but we focused on our plan in 2018 and we planned on bringing in this fourth operated frac crew in August, and we were having those discussions in February. And we've made sure we had extra supervision onsite and made sure that we were planning our business accordingly and making sure we didn't stub our toe going into 2017, which was always going to be a year about execution after our industry returned to growth after the downturn in 2016. Daniel Eugene McSpirit : Got it. Again, I appreciate the answers. Thanks again, have a great day. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Dan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. I appreciate the time. I guess I just wanted to hit on some questions around high-level capital efficiency as we think about the 2018 program versus the 2017 program. What would you say are the key headwinds and then also tailwinds to capital efficiency, perhaps broken up by the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin as we think about our dollar spend in 2018 versus what you spent in 2017? Paul S. Molnar: Michael, in 2018, obviously the Delaware will be a higher percentage of total capital spent. I think from a rate of returns perspective, we're still very bullish on rate of return out there. And from a cost perspective, I think our drilling guys continue to get better and cut days on location and increase cycle times on the Delaware. Going to the Midland Basin side, as horizontal production continues to increase as a percentage of total, we're still going to push our cash costs down. As we talked about, the organization is set up for running the 10-plus rigs that we need today on a G&A perspective. And from an LOE perspective, putting in this infrastructure is going to only increase our netbacks as we look into 2018. Michael Anthony Hall : And as you look at I guess both assets in the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin, broadly the industry has had a pretty big tailwind from an improvement and productivity per 1,000-foot from a change in completion design, landing zones, et cetera, over the last couple of years. How does that rate of change look as you look forward in each basin for Diamondback? Travis D. Stice: I'd say the rate of change in the Delaware still looks higher than the Midland. I think on the Midland Basin side, given our experience there over the last five years, the range of outcomes is a smaller range today than it was two or three years ago when the big step-change in completion design happened. So I mean on the Delaware side, we continue to test different landing zones and different completion designs. I think the potential for increased performance on that side of the basin is higher at this point. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And then I guess last on my end is, you alluded to infrastructure spend as a percent of total capital coming down to a somewhat more normalized level in 2018 as you move past the first quarter. What does a more normalized level of infrastructure spend relative to total capital look like for Diamondback? Travis D. Stice: On a long-term basis, it's probably 8% to 10% of total capital spent on infrastructure. And really, that's the big heavy lifting is going to be done because these oil pipelines will be sized for full field development. And then after that, it's just adding the water infrastructure and the disposal infrastructure on a just-in-time basis on both basins as volumes grow. Michael Anthony Hall : Perfect, thanks so much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Travis Stice, CEO, I turn the call back over to you. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Adam Lawlis, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Karen. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2017 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During the conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, feature performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's fourth quarter 2017 conference call. 2017 was a transformational year for Diamondback. The Company grew production 84% year-over-year within operating cash flow, decreased cash costs 11% year-over-year, more than doubled EBITDA and generated a return on average capital employed of 10.5% for the year. We successfully integrated multiple acquisitions that doubled our asset base and continued to execute a best-in-class metrics on a significantly larger capital plan. Looking ahead to 2018, our strategy has not changed. We will continue to grow production within cash flow at industry-leading rates with best-in-class cash margins and cost control. Our 2018 budget assumes 40% production growth within cash flow at today's commodity prices with the flexibly to accelerate should commodity price allow. Capital discipline remains central to our Company's philosophy. Our long-term plan is to continue to increase our rig count to about 16 rigs within cash flow and then begin generating significant free cash. We believe at a certain point in the company's life cycle, it should generate a return on capital in excess of its cost of capital and subsequently return capital to its stakeholders. Therefore, as a sign of appreciation for helping Diamondback become a company it is today, we are taking the first step in return of capital by instituting a $0.50 annual dividend to be paid quarterly beginning in the first quarter of 2018. Again, this is a first step for the company. We will continue to accelerate our activity within cash flow and have significant cushion to protect and grow this dividend as well as assess other avenues of capital return. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hollis : Thank you, Travis. We are operating 10 rigs today, six in the Midland Basin and four in the Southern Delaware Basin as well as operating five dedicated completion crews. We plan to add an 11th rig late in the first quarter of 2018 to begin work in the Southern Delaware Basin. This year, we plan to run between 10 and 12 rigs and as always, we\u2019ll continue to assess accelerating activity as commodity price allows. Turning to Slide 8, Diamondback generated $928 million of EBITDA in 2017 on a total capital spend of $861 million. As shown on this page, capital discipline has always been a core philosophy of this company, and we have differentially grown production within cash flow over the last three years. Slide 9, shows our total completed lateral footage and average lateral length over time as well as the number of wells drilled and completed each quarter. Diamondback continues to maximize efficiencies by drilling and completing longer wells with our average lateral length completed up 60% since the beginning of 2015 to an average of over 10,000 feet last quarter. Turning ahead to Slide 13. We have new data from multiple well results across our Southern Delaware Basin assets, including longer-aged data from the Warlander well as well as early-time data on our first Wolfcamp B test in the Southern Delaware Basin. We expect to run four or five rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin in 2018. While the majority of our capital will focus on the Wolfcamp A, we also plan to test other zones such as of the second Bone Spring in Pecos County, the third Bone Spring in Reeves County as well as the Wolfcamp B in this coming year. Our infrastructure development continues to advance in the Delaware Basin with all oil gathering systems expected to be complete in the coming quarter. Electrification, saltwater disposal and freshwater systems continue to be developed as we accelerate activity in the area. Turning to the Midland Basin. We currently are running six rigs with plans to maintain this cadence in the near term. Slide 15 shows the continued impressive performance from our assets with wells in each area continuing to exceed expectations in reserve, audit or type curves. On Slide 16, we introduced our Limelight Prospect. We have recently secured 19,000 net acres in Ector and Crane Counties, focused on an emerging Mississippian oil play. We plan to begin our initial appraisal of the acreage this year. A core Diamondback belief is that the lowest cost operator wins. This is even more prominent as we have now moved into a true manufacturing mode. Over the past year, we have added to our already extraordinary staff and built several strategic business partnerships to allow us to operate in the years to come in an efficient, cost-effective manner. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Tracy Dick : Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's fourth quarter 2017 net income was $1.16 per diluted share and our adjusted net income was $1.56. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $302 million, up 30% quarter-over-quarter with cash operating costs of $8.28 per BOE. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $246 million on drilling, completion and non-operated properties, and $61 million on infrastructure. For the full-year we generated $28 million of free cash flow, excluding acquisitions. As shown on Slide 19, Diamondback ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with a net debt to Q4 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times and $1 billion of liquidity pro forma for our January tack-on to our senior notes due 2025. These proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our full year 2018 production guidance of 108,000 to 116,000 BOE a day implies 40% year-over-year production growth within cash flow on an estimated $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion capital plan, of which $125 million $175 million is dedicated to our infrastructure. With these comments now complete, I'll now turn the call over to Travis. Travis Stice : Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to execute on a transformational year as a result of our continued commitment to execution and low-cost operations. We believe the theme entering 2018 is no different from the theme throughout 2018, namely, that the best execution at the lowest cost in the commodity-based business wins. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : Good morning and congratulations on another fantastic execution quarter. Travis Stice : Thank you John. John Nelson : Travis, FANG had previously guided investors to expect the return of capital to begin once you achieve the optimal rig count for your asset base, which you're, I guess, now talking about 16 below where you expect to be over the course of this year. Can you just speak to the decision to pull back timing forward and if it's a sign that you're worried at the marginal dollar return? And this environment could be tighter because of service industry tightness or midstream takeaway concerns? Travis Stice : Yeah, John, that is a good comment. We always want to grow at a rate that allows us to continue our cost leadership position. And we're not really changing the institution of the dividend, we're not changing our strategy to get to that 16 to 18 rigs, we just want to make sure we do so at the best \u2013 most efficient capital rate that we can do so. I mean, if you go back in our history, we built this company through really an acquire-and-support strategy and we had tremendous support through our shareholders while we built the company. And we created a return of capital employed this year or rather in 2017 that was already in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, and we just believe that our next step in our company's evolution is a true return of capital to our shareholders by initiating a dividend. It's really a first step towards a larger capital return program once we've reached that kind of 2016 to 2018 rig cadence. John Nelson : Great, and so should we think about the growth of that dividend at a pace faster than that rig count in the short term? Or is it just dependent more on kind of the commodity price environment? Travis Stice : Yeah, we\u2019re certainly always going to be range bound by oil price. But look, that's a board decision, but we'll talk about the board as to exactly how that dividend is going to grow. We just think it's important right now that we just \u2013 that we commit to initiating the dividend and we commit to making that thing grow over time, not only get backed into a corner exactly what the dividend rate's going to grow at. John Nelson : Fair enough, and given your on the ground in Midland, it's my follow-up I was wondering if you can comment on how you're seeing the labor environment currently, how tight things potentially are and if there is any concerns you can have for industry labor force over the first half of 2018? Travis Stice : John, specifically, with boots on the ground out here in the Permian, anytime you see a cycle in oil price, which we've seen over the last three years, activity levels increase, rig count increase, all the ancillary businesses that support those rigs, they increase and it does create pressures. And I think that's one of the reasons pressures on human capital and pressures on operator capital and that's one of the reasons that we signaled a slightly higher CapEx this year is because we're seeing a tightness in some of these service lines. The typical culprits every one flashes to rigs in pressure pumping equipment. And while we have seen some increases certainly through 2017, there's another 40% of the business lines that really hadn't been able to generate much returns over the last three years and that's what we're starting to see also is that size of the business that's trying to rebuild their business to respond to this activity level rebuild their working capital and get their balance sheet in shape, that's what we're also seeing. So if commodity price rolls back over, we certainly expect service costs to halt the increase or maybe roll back over. And we know that there's a lot of equipment that's been built and coming online midyear, but we just thought it was prudent for our investors to know how we're thinking about the business on the 14th day of February. John Nelson : And just one housekeeping item, I'm not sure if I missed. Mike said there was a timing expectation on wells in the new Ector County prospect or the number of wells you guys anticipate to drill this year? Travis Stice : Yes. We'll update the market more later on. We're working on assessment, we're doing the technical work right now before we put the drill bit in the ground, but we'll update the market as soon as we have meaningful information. John Nelson : Great, I\u2019ll let somebody else hop on. Congrats again on the quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning all. Travis question for you or the guys. Looking at Slide 12, could you talk about \u2013 the one that talks about your inventory strengths, could you talk a bit on that, about how you all think about your inventory given you tend to have, to me, among some of the more conservative spacing out there. So I guess my overall question is on the bottom, you mentioned over 3,800 gross locations, is that still assuming just on your conservative spacing, you still have that type of locations? And obviously, that could improve based on if you might down space just slightly? Travis Stice : Yeah, certainly down space represents an upside to our gross location count. You've heard us consistently communicate conservatism in the way that we lay these spacing assumptions out. The other thing that could impact gross locations as well is as you've seen over the last several years, we've continued to increase the lateral lengths, so we're still completing as many lateral feet as we originally had in our inventory. But the fact that we're drilling, in some cases like we reported now, over 13,000-foot laterals, those have an impact on the inventory. I still think it's very prudent to be conservative in the way that you communicate the number of locations that are available to be developed. And what I really hope, Neal, is that we are kind of migrating as an industry away from people counting locations and trying to do the NAV work-up and increasing stock price and really focus on that manufacturing process and that conversion of rock and the cash flow at the most efficient margins, which is where Diamondback has tried to move that commentary. Neal Dingmann : Okay, now I guess, I'd be remised if I didn't ask you a bit about M&A. And maybe, specifically with M&A, what type of deals are out there? And how large are the inventory deals that are still out there in the Permian? I just \u2013 again, we haven't seen anything too much out of you or the rest of the group in a bit, so I'm just kind of curious any comments you make there. Travis Stice : Of course, we don\u2019t talk about ongoing M&A. But just philosophically, the fact that you've not seen any trades occur really very, very recently, really much through 2017, really talks to the lack of true quality acreage that's out there to be added. And somewhat, from Diamondback's perspective, it's a curse or blessings because any M&A activity that we engage in, it has to be immediately competitive for capital within our own portfolio. And we've got such a strong portfolio, there's just not a good cross-section of assets that kind of fits in that top quartile of Diamondback's portfolio. Neal Dingmann : Okay, and one last housekeeping maybe for you or Tracy. Just on that CapEx that you put out there for the year, is that \u2013 could you just talk about it. Is that going to be relatively linear? Or is there any kind of color that you all can give around that? Kaes Van' t Hof : It's pretty linear, Neal. We're adding rig 11 here probably towards the end of Q1 and we don't anticipate a major boost after that. So a fairly linear spend throughout the year. Neal Dingmann : Very good, thanks guys. Thanks Kaes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew Venker : Good morning, everyone. Travis, with the return of capital starting a bit earlier than I think we \u2013 most people on The Street were expecting, is the appetite for acquisitions deemphasized? Or are those two related? Or how do you think about that? Travis Stice : There is really no relationship between our M&A strategy and a dividend because when we sit behind closed doors and talk about M&A opportunities, it's always about how can we do a smart deal that can generate differentiated returns to our investors and do so accretively, and the fact that we've instituted a dividend really doesn't change that strategy. We're still looking to do smart deals and accretive deals. Drew Venker : And Travis as the business matures, do you foresee any change in the philosophy of how you fund acquisitions from primarily equity funding to cash-funded acquisitions over time? Or is that something more near term? Or has that even crossed your mind? Travis Stice : Yes, that's sort of a board discussion. But look, we're not looking to build a system that packs a lot of discretionary cash on the balance sheet. We're going to look at deals and we're going to try to fund them very thoughtfully, and if they're accretive to our shareholders, we expect they'll be widely accepted if we consummate. Drew Venker : Okay. And then just one on \u2013 to clarify the spending philosophy. Do you expect to increase activity this year if we have higher oil prices from where we stand today? Or were your comments about increasing activity more flexible on the time line? Travis Stice : Well, we certainly want to maintain maximum flexibility. And we said we could accelerate activity, but we've got to accelerate activity in a time frame where commodity prices support it, but also service costs support that we can still generate the kind of growth we're talking about at industry-leading efficiency rates. So we've never been about growth for growth's sake, and Diamondback's never been a drill-baby-drill company. It's about very efficient and thoughtful prosecution of our development plan that generates maximum returns to our shareholders, and we've done it in 2015 when post-OPEC meeting and we started laying drilling rigs down. We did it again in 2016 when there was a dislocation between service cost \u2013 or stimulation cost and oil price. And I think we've got a pretty good track record of demonstrating how we think about funding the business. Drew Venker : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Glick : Hey, guys. Could just talk a little bit about the midstream investments you had planned for this year and how that should impact LOE as we move through the year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Mike, our two oil gathering systems in the Delaware Basin should be completed by the end of this quarter so it should be beneficial to our LOE Q2 onwards from that respect. Electrification, we're working as quickly as we can to get electrification across our entire Delaware asset base. I would assume towards the end of the year, you're starting to get more and more wells hooked up through electricity and almost a full field electrified by the end of this year. On the water and the freshwater and water disposal side, we've built \u2013 we've got enough capacity today, we're building some lines to connect different parts of the infrastructure across the asset base, but I would assume that continues to be developed on a just-in-time basis. Travis Stice : Mike, I might just add to that, if you go back in our company's history and remember how we built the Midland Basin, we've spent a lot of dollars upfront on infrastructure in order to generate the cost-leading margins that we're enjoying today. And so we're a couple of years behind that in Delaware because we just really started working March of 2017 doing that. But the corollary is very strong, correlation is very strong between investing in infrastructure, driving costs down and increasing margins in the Midland Basin that we've already shown we can do. That's the strategy in the Delaware also. Michael Glick : Got you. And then in Pecos County... Travis Stice : I\u2019m sorry, if I just can add one example I forgot to add. I was going to say we've got some of that started in the third quarter, fourth quarter last year in the Delaware and some of the facility spend that we're talking about this year is actually carrying dollars from 2017 in the Delaware, yes. Michael Glick : Got it. And then in Pecos County, can you talk a bit about how your completion design is evolving and how ESP is impacting well performance? Travis Stice : Yes, we've seen a correlation between sand volume, fluid volume and EUR and so we're continuing to try to optimize that because there's a cost component to that equation as well. So we're trying to actually hunt for the right balance of increased cost and increased EUR with the corresponding increase in a project IRR. So I would say probably around 2,500 pounds of fluid in the Delaware right now is probably our most common. And then on the Midland Basin side, we're somewhere in that 1,600 to 1,800 pounds per foot on the Midland Basin side. Michael Glick : Got it. And then just last one from me. Just in your Limelight Prospect, just wondering if you could give us some more color on the genesis of the play? Travis Stice : Yes, our scientists actually identified the play about three years ago up in Andrews County. There's a couple of private equity companies that have actually gone up there and drilled some pretty good wells. And so with that knowledge, we continue to push a long trend there and we found out, at a real low entry point, we found a similar play \u2013 or the similar depositional environment that we're able to acquire grassroot leasing at a real \u2013 really attractive price. And so while for $11 billion, $12 billion company Diamondback, it's not going to be huge needle mover, but it's a nice piece of business for us and it's going to compete for capital given success. So it's still too premature to talk because we haven't and we're still on our assessment phase doing above-ground technical work, but look for us to provide more color on that as soon as we get results sometime this year. Michael Glick : Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Douthat with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gordon Douthat : Hey good morning, everybody. Just another question on the dividend and kind of how you think that plays out over \u2013 as you built scale up to that 16-plus rig cadence, how do you look to balance kind of your growth profile with the free cash flow and returning capital longer term? Travis Stice : Well, the balance is always going to be how can we with some maximum rate we can grow at, at the same time maintaining our capital efficiencies and our cost margins. So we kind of have a natural governor on that, but the dividend is just a part of that overall return to shareholders. And like I said, once we get up to that 16 to 18 rigs, we've got multiple opportunities to return capital to investors beyond the dividend if that's the direction we go. Gordon Douthat : Okay. And just a question over in the Delaware. With a lot of the activity being in the upper \u2013 or the Wolfcamp A, just wanted to get your thoughts on the upper versus the lower given some of your tests that have been online for a bit longer since the last update. So just want to get your views on developing those two zones. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, we'd say they're pretty competitive. We have a 3D seismic shoot coming across the whole acreage position that we should be able to access towards the middle of the year, which should help us landing spots throughout the whole acreage block. But upper and lower today seem very competitive. Gordon Douthat : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Asit, your line is open. Asit Sen : Can you hear me? Travis Stice : Yes, we can hear, Asit. We lost you again. Okay, the next question, operator? Asit Sen : Can you hear me? Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning and congrats on a strong update. Circling back to your 2018 capital budget, what commodity price and services cost scenarios do the upper and lower bands of your CapEx reflect? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, I'd say the upper end of the CapEx is a $60-plus world. I'd say the midpoint to lower end is where we are currently. Service costs, we're pretty conservative in assuming 12% overall well cost increase for the full year on the Midland side and 17% for the full year on the Delaware side. That's not happening necessarily in Q1. But if oil price stays where it is and where it's been the first 55 days of the year, we anticipate that some of the service guys are going to come calling for some price increases. Derrick Whitfield : Got it. That makes sense. And then moving over to Page 9 of your presentation. You guys did a nice job of comparing completion cycle times between the Midland and Delaware. If you were to aggregate the best times by segment in the Delaware, to what degree could you improve that 800 to 1,000 lateral feet noted in the presentation? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, they're operating very efficiently completing 800 to 1,000 feet a day in the Delaware. It's just the size of the jobs and the amount of fluid and sand you're pumping through the equipment and the horsepower that gets you that that 800 to 1,000 feet. On the Midland side, we're doing jobs that are 1,600 to 1,800 pounds a foot, which is 40% less than the Delaware side. So it's logical that in Midland you can get about 40% more lateral footage a day. Derrick Whitfield : Got it. And then my last question would be on the Limelight Prospect on Page 16. Could you comment on the primary interval you would target in and just give us a sense as to how productive this analog interval is in Andrews County? Mike Hollis : Primary target interval is in that lower Barnett and Meramec interval. And it's public data up there. It's primarily drilled by Zarvona and Elevation, and we've looked at the wells and the well cost and what they've done, it looked like it would be \u2013 it would compete for capital in our current program if we can duplicate similar success down here. Derrick Whitfield : Hey guys, that\u2019s all from me. Thanks for your comments. Mike Hollis : Thanks Derrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open. Bob Morris : Thank you. Travis, about six months ago you talked about 20 to 22 rigs being the optimum level for your current acreage footprint and I know now you're talking about 16 to 18 is the optimum level. Can you comment on why that's come down? Travis Stice : No, it's always been 16 to 18, Bob. Maybe it may also be that we're a few \u2013 several months ago or several quarters ago, maybe we were drilling wells slower than we're drilling now and we're drilling them a lot faster now, so we're drilling a lot faster and utilize less rigs. Bob Morris : Okay. And then the second question, on the Limelight Prospect, you've got 19,000 acres, which is a relatively small footprints and you have yet to test that. Any reason you're announcing that today before the results, which might signal others to maybe bid up the acreage to increase your position there at some point rather than just holding off until you have some results? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, it's just FD rules. We prefer not to, but we came with it \u2013 with our 10-K and we're happy with the size of the position and looking to test it given our current size. Bob Morris : And then on the wells that have been drilled, you mentioned private equity operator in Andrews, what would you expect the oil, gas and NGL mix to be from these targeted zones in the Barnett and Meramec there? Kaes Van' t Hof : Can't make a comment on that at this time. We're very, very early. It is oil weighted, heavy oil weighted. Bob Morris : Okay, great. Thank you. all right, that\u2019s good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jason Wangler : Good morning. Travis, I was curious last week on the Viper call, you talked about some drop-downs potentially from Diamondback down to Viper. As you think about the strategy at Diamondback, how do you think about those transactions in terms of the use of proceeds? And would even potentially use Viper shares directly to Diamondback as to make those transactions? Travis Stice : Yes. Jason, it's probably a combination. I think we definitely want to see a public marker value on the minerals that we have sort of at the Diamondback level, but also we can use that cash to accelerate and further improve the economics of both Viper and Diamondback. I think the exciting thing for us with these minerals we don't want to hold them at the Diamondback level too long and we're coming up upon running four or five rigs here in the Delaware and that's going to get some real mineral production going in 2018 and allow those drop-downs to happen. Jason Wangler : Sure, thanks. And then just on the infrastructure side, $125 million, $175 million this year. Is that a pretty decent run rate as we think about maybe 2019 or should that start to fall off as you kind of build out that infrastructure side? Travis Stice : No, that number should come down over time. This is, again, on our earlier comments, this is getting the systems in place just like we did in the Midland Basin side where you're putting in the major gathering systems, you're getting every \u2013 all your produced fluids out of trucks on the pipe and so these were all front-end development type expenditures. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, just for round numbers, when you look what our Midland Basin spend to total capital, it's about 5% or 6% now on the infrastructure side, so we anticipate the Delaware to get there in short order. Jason Wangler : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tim Rezvan with Mizuho. Your line is open. Tim Rezvan : Good morning, folks. I was hoping to follow up on the midstream theme. When you were asked earlier, you focused on the electrification and gathering systems. How do you view water as a potential bottleneck in terms of sourcing and disposal? And how much of the CapEx on midstream is allocated to water? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, we have more than enough water on our Pecos County asset. Actually, the Capitan Reef flows through the eastern side of the acreage. So from a freshwater perspective, we have more than enough that we need to prosecute our plan. And from a percentage of overall capital, I'd say, water's about a third of our total capital, oil is another third and then the rest are tank batteries, gas gathering upgrades and the electrification. Tim Rezvan : Okay. And then on the disposal side, no concerns? Kaes Van' t Hof : No concerns. We're continuing to drill SWDs, but also flow barrels south and east of our position, which I think will advantage us in the long-term. Tim Rezvan : Okay, great. And then as my follow-up, you all gave guidance of the number of horizontal completions. You're clearly in manufacturing mode across the Midland Basin and possibly even in some areas in the A, on the Delaware Basin side. But how many of those wells would you consider to be more on the delineation side? You talked about the Bone Spring opportunity. Just trying to understand across that 3,800-well location count, how many of those horizons will you kind of be able to transition towards more exploitation mode as we move into 2019? Travis Stice : Yes. I'd say we wouldn't put locations in our deck if we didn't feel they were very economic and more of a development-type location. Just coming back to 2018 total wells, I'd say probably 10% are step-outs or tested of different zones that we haven't tested and mostly in the Delaware Basin. Tim Rezvan : Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning, I\u2019m just looking at the cost delta for 2018 versus 2017, you're seeing a larger cost increase at the midpoint in the Delaware versus the Midland. And is that just \u2013 I mean, is that due to solely using locally sourced sand in the Midland and the cost savings there? Or are there other things going on between the cost increase delta on a per lateral foot basis? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Gail, it's a combination. We're assuming local sand on the Midland side really kicking in Q2. So you're going to get some savings there. On the Delaware side, we are pumping more of the bigger jobs, which relative to last year when we were assuming probably an average smaller job on the completion side. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then going back to the ESP-ing, you guys are seeing a significant production uplift in the Delaware following the ESP conversion versus gas lift. I know you guys are still doing up the electrical infrastructure in the Delaware. So is the \u2013 do the current wells that you plan to bring online in 2018, do you have the electrical infrastructure to support ESP conversion as they need to be put on pump? Or how should we think about that in terms of that potential incremental uplift as you move through time into that infrastructure build-out? Travis Stice : Hey, Gail, as we go through 2018, we're going to \u2013 we're moving toward electrification in the field. But currently, we do have some backbones built and we have some local generation runoff of field gas or diesel that is powering these ESPs. So we will absolutely have the availability of running the ESPs, but they won't to be on the high line powers, we'd call it into the latter half. Yes, ma'am. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Tullis : Thank you. Travis, congrats on closing out the year on a strong note. Lots already been asked, but going back over to the cost side, when you look at the LOE for the fourth quarter, it still shook out on a barrel basis toward the low end of the 2018 range. Are you seeing cost pressures there that kind of point to more toward the midpoint or higher end of the range? And are there more workovers planned in 2018 versus 2017? Travis Stice : Richard, what you're really saying is you've got to hear the commentary around our midstream. We're not fully built out in the midstream side yet. And a lot of that midstream translates \u2013 a lot of that lack of midstream development in the first half of the year translates to higher LOE. So again, we're just trying to be transparent that the first half of the year certainly is going to be impacted by the fact we're still having the truck and we don't have electrification like Mike and Kaes were talking about. As we push forward into the second half of the year, we hope to start seeing the benefits of our midstream investments in the form of lower LOE, but we're just trying to give you the way that we see the landscape right now. Of all the things that you should think about Diamondback, the low-cost operation mantra is alive and well. And so even though LOE moved up a few nickels year-over-year, we're still focused on pushing that to the best-in-class margin level. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, and really that's also Delaware volumes are growing and continuing to become a bigger piece of our total production product so. Richard Tullis : That's helpful, thank you. And just lastly for me, going back to 2018 drilling plans, any thoughts to test the Avalon in 2018? And how are you thinking about that Lower Second Bone Spring target given the initial results from that Kelley State well? Travis Stice : Yes, no plans on the Avalon and we'll \u2013 we're \u2013 what's the update on we're looking to drill an offset to the Kelley State? Mike Hollis : We're going to be drilling more Kelley State \u2013 or more Second Bone wells. We're primarily, as I think you stated, Wolfcamp A because of lease obligations and also every Wolfcamp well that we drill we're getting more data on the Second Bone as we drill through and we're basically mapping out and we've got a 3D seismic that we anticipate having acquired and interpreted by midyear so we're really still excited about the Second Bone, but as we've stated there, primary focus is going to be on the Wolfcamp A at least through the first half of 2018. Richard Tullis : All right, that\u2019s all from me. Thanks everyone. Travis Stice : Thank you, Richard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, to you and your team there. Travis Stice : Hi, good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : I wanted to take another crack at something that, maybe from a different angle, something that other people have asked about your kind of longer-term philosophy on balance sheet and capital structure. As I look at it, you should, guys, continue to grow and spend within cash flow, you naturally delever on a multiple basis when you look at your net debt-to-EBITDA. And so I'm curious is there's some lower level that you and the board have discussed that you don't want to go below to kind of maintain some efficiency in your capital structure? Is that a reasonable way to think about it? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think that\u2019s a good problem to have. We haven't had discussions on the low end. I will say we do feel like the balance sheet can support us doing the little deals, right? I mean, last year, we did another $350 million or $400 million of acquisition at the Diamondback level that we didn't need to raise equity for and put them on our balance sheet and still delevered through the year. So we really think of the balance sheet as our ability to continue to block up acreage, buy out working interest and increase our efficiency that way. Charles Meade : Got it. Travis Stice : Charles, again, it's \u2013 when you look at what we're doing in 2018, it kind of lends itself to that conversation because we got the high-growth rate within cash flow, we're doing it to highest margins and we're delevering the balance sheet and instituting the dividend. So these are good \u2013 these are all good combinations that we're discussing at the board as we look into the future for how to best manage the balance sheet and our capital structure. Charles Meade : It\u2019s a great set to have for your discussions. I wanted to ask one question about operations on Midland side hasn't been touched on yet. This \u2013 you guys had a strong pad result, and I guess, how we're counting with the bullfrog \u2013 was at the South bullfrog pad and you had Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry there, so I wonder if you could decompose perhaps that \u2013 those IPs between the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry and give a hint if you're seeing anything new or different in the Lower Spraberry on that eastern half of the Midland Basin that might change your appetite there? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean, I think the Lower Spraberry keeps getting better and better on eastern side of the basin just as the Wolfcamp A keeps getting better and better on the western side of the basin. So going back to this bullfrog pad, we did a joint development with the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A. And on a pad level basis, I think that, that pad competes for capital if anything in the top decile of our portfolio. The As have a higher initial IPs, but the Lower Spraberry wells stay at a peak rate longer. Charles Meade : Great. That\u2019s the detail I was looking for, thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Dan McSpirit with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Dan McSpirit : Thank you, folks, good morning. Few questions on decline rates, if I could. What do you estimate to be the decline rate on PDPs in the Delaware and Midland Basins and maybe on the oil stream alone? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Corporate decline's 35% overall. Dan McSpirit : Any breakdown by product stream there? Kaes Van' t Hof : No. Oil will decline slightly, slightly more than the overall. Dan McSpirit : Okay, great. And what about new wells as more volumes are pumped downhole, that is \u2013 how does the first year decline differ today versus previously? And is there any change to how the wells are flowed to the rest of the decline? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think it's safe to say that we keep learning more and more as we drill more of these wells and they seem to be producing better longer on the Midland Basin side, if you look at how these wells have done on a longer-dated basis versus prior wells, 2017 was even better than 2016 and 2015. Dan McSpirit : Okay, great. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Eli Kantor with DIR Advisors. Your line is open. Eli Kantor : Good morning, guys and congrats on the quarter. Travis Stice : Thank you, Eli. Eli Kantor : Given the interest in exploration and the recent success Viper had in South Texas, can you comment on Diamondback's appetite to look outside the Permian for other exploration prospects? Travis Stice : Yes, we\u2019re Permian focused, Eli. Eli Kantor : Do you have a ballpark figure on what percentage of your Midland in Delaware Basin leases still within the areas that you highlight that's providing 1 million barrel-plus EURs? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean, 90% on the Delaware and probably 85% on the Midland. Eli Kantor : Great, thanks guys. Travis Stice : Thank you, Eli. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So I have two questions, first on the lateral length. Your average lateral length is creeping up nicely, 9,300 average this year your plan. What is the longest lateral you planned for this year? And what are your thoughts on diminishing returns with longer lateral lengths? Travis Stice : Asit, our longest wells this year, it's a little unique because we complete about 12,500, sometimes it's closer to 13,000 feet. But a lot of these are wells that we have to drill from off-lease. So the actual drilled length of these wells sometimes are over 14,000-foot of lateral lengths and completed because we drill from off-lease on. So roughly 14,000 is kind of the top number. When you look at efficiency break-over right now, out to 10,000 feet, we definitely see a one-to-one relation Midland and Delaware. On the Midland side, the longer laterals, we still see that one-to-one out to that 12,500. Over on the Delaware side, just due to the fact that the large volumes of fluid that we have to move, we're still assessing it, but we're seeing on these longer wells that we have the muted IP per lateral foot in the very early time of these wells and it's just related to the volume and the restriction of the batteries. So they hold longer than the shorter wells, but the shorter wells will show a higher IP because we can move that same amount of fluid through those batteries just it's over a shorter footage. Asit Sen : Thanks. And secondly, Travis, conceptually looking out into next year and if you're think about adding a rig, let's say, every three months to five months, what do you see as some of your biggest challenges outside of labor? I'm specifically focused on ancillary services. Travis Stice : Yes, we've got to have a very collaborative approach to building our rig fleet with our service providers. We treat each other as business partners and we've got to be able to grow at that cadence and maintain absolute cost leadership position. So we're not going to add that next rig or the next frac spread or that next whatever piece of equipment unless we're confident that through our supervision and through collaboration with our service partners, we can do so at the same efficient margin we're currently producing at. We just feel so \u2013 it's just so fundamentally ingrained at us that we've got to have best-in-class execution at the lowest-cost operations that we're just going to let that be the governor on how quickly we grow volumes. Asit Sen : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jamaal Dardar with TPH & Company. Your line is open. Jamaal Dardar : Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks, Jamaal. Jamaal Dardar : Had a quick question on the Wolfcamp B well, I think in the Reeves County, pretty impressive result versus our expectations. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the need to potentially co-develop the A and the B across the Delaware? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I think we're spaced conservatively enough that we feel the need to co-develop. There's a significant vertical distance between the B and the A in that area. We saw a narrative appearance on this particular pad. We're excited about the B. I don't think \u2013 it's not as good as the A, but it definitely provides us a second, along with the Third Bone Spring in the third zone that competes for capital in our ReWard acreage. Jamaal Dardar : Okay, great, thank you. And just wanted to get a sense of any other spacing tests, I know that came up quite a bit, that you have conservative spacing out there. So just kind of want to get a sense of any operated results we should be looking out from you guys? Kaes Van' t Hof : Again, no major spacing tests prior on the Midland Basin side. I think we're happy with where our spacing is today. On the Delaware, we're drilling two well pads so we're not getting a ton of spacing data, especially as we're looking to hold a few leases throughout our acreage position. So I'd anticipate more spacing tests in the out years. Jamaal Dardar : All right, great. Thank you, guys. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. Michael Hall : Thanks, good morning. Kudos on the continued leadership. I guess, I wanted to look at Slide 10 a little bit in the context of some of the commentary and questions around LOE. Now you're showing effectively the same operating costs between the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A and the Midland versus Delaware Basins, respectively. How \u2013 is that \u2013 is the operating cost used in that, assuming the improvements that you expect to see from the infrastructure uplift or the infrastructure install I should say? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Mike, we're just trying put out what we put out publicly from a cash cost perspective, and I don't want to get into the details of what LOE is on the Midland side versus the Delaware. So we put the overall cash cross to from the quarter as the actual for that illustrative example now. Obviously, the first year, LOE's a lot lower on a well than it is in the out years and on an overall company basis. So we just use the overall company numbers. Michael Hall : Okay. And I guess, how much LOE do you think you can take out from the infrastructure side of things over the course of 2018? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think it's fair that LOE continues to trend down over the next few years. We're not going to stop until these wells are flowing back for free, but it's safe to say we will continue to make incremental progress throughout the year. Michael Hall : Okay. And I guess, last follow-up on that is just around water cuts. Can you remind us what water cuts look like in the Pecos versus Reeves County asset? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Pecos and Reese are about 4 :1 versus the Midland Basin, about 1.5 or 2.5 water-to-oil ratio. Michael Hall : Okay. But no appreciable difference in Pecos versus Reese on your asset? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, sir. Michael Hall : All right, perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from the line of John Aschenbeck with Seaport Global. Your line is open. John Aschenbeck : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the Limelight Prospect, specifically on your comments about the Barnett and Meramec and Andrews County. Was curious if you think those formations are prospective on your acreage in Central and Eastern Andrews or if that acreage is just too far off the platform? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, maybe on the Western side, but we don't have enough information to make it a true answer at this point. John Aschenbeck : Okay, great. And then a follow-up there. In terms of the results that you've seen from private operators, I'm not sure if I missed it or not, but was curious what you've seen in terms of just initial production rates and then well cost as well? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I'm not going to comment on that. It's safe to say that we look at competitor results throughout the entire Permian Basin. And we're on top of it and making sure that we're up to speed on the latest tests, especially in areas nearby our acreage. So, no, I'd say we wouldn't lease 19,000 acres without some confidence that other operators have done a good job. John Aschenbeck : Okay, fair enough. Understood. And that kind of feeds into my last one here, I was wondering if there's been any Mississippian results around your position in Ector and Crane or will you be essentially pioneering the effort in those counties? Mike Hollis : We\u2019ll be the first in this area as far as in this play that we're \u2013 that we've mapped. There have been some other tests, earlier tests, back \u2013 way back when, when the Barnett play was taking some vertical tests. But we've used all the data from earlier vertical wells and the date available to assess the position. And we will be drilling a pilot hole with core on our first test. So we'll use that to further fine-tune our landing. John Aschenbeck : Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to our CEO, Travis Stice, for his final remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks, again, to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Towanda. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2018 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's first quarter 2018 conference call. The first quarter was a strong start to the year for Diamondback as we grew production 10% quarter-over-quarter and delivered a company-record realized cash margin of 83%. Our low-cost operations and capital efficient production growth enabled us to generate $21 million in free cash flow for the quarter, while earning over a 13% annualized return on average capital employed. We are operating 11 rigs today, six in the Midland Basin and five in the Southern Delaware Basin, along with five dedicated completion crews. As we look ahead to the rest of 2018, we will continue to match operating cash flow to drilling and infrastructure CapEx and increase or decrease rig count accordingly as we have done now for over three years. We continue to see improving well results across our acreage with standout long-dated production from multiple wells in Pecos County, as well as a unique test of the Third Bone Spring shale in Reeves County. Leverage remains low at 1.2 times annualized EBITDA and we are set to pay our first quarterly dividend on May 29 to shareholders of record on May 21. Moving forward to slide 6, we give an update to our takeaway strategy. We currently have over 90% of our total production on pipe moving to 95% or higher by year-end 2018, removing the risk of rising trucking costs from our forward operating plan. We have multiyear acreage dedication and firm service for in-basin gathering on the Oryx, NuStar and Reliance systems, which deliver barrels to the Crane, Midland or Colorado City markets. These systems then have multiple downstream connection agreements in place to long-haul pipelines. We sell our barrels at the wellhead to multiple first purchasers throughout the Permian, who have physical space on various long-haul pipelines out of the basin. On top of this, as part of our long-term strategy to maximize international pricing exposure, we recently signed a 50,000 barrel per day agreement to be a firm shipper on the Gray Oak pipeline and are actively working multiple firm purchasing deals to maximize pricing exposure over both the near term and the long term. Because of the attractive nature of the Gray Oak project, we've been able to leverage our substantial multiyear firm commitment of 50,000 barrels delivered to the Gulf Coast in exchange for near-term flow assurance and Gulf Coast pricing solutions. We look forward to continuing to update our shareholders as these initiatives progress and believe the only way to guarantee flow assurance out of the basin is through firm space and true take-or-pay contracts versus financial protections. We soon expect to have a majority of our barrels exposed to an international price. Turning to slide 7, we demonstrate not only our acquisition track record but also the subsequent deal-by-deal per share value created as a result of this acquisition strategy. Since going public, Diamondback has grown EBITDA per share by over 700%, while commodity prices have declined 28% over the same period. We have been active yet selective in our acquisition strategy with accretion and full cycle economics serving as the primary drivers of our decision-making process. As shown on slides 8 and 9, Diamondback's acreage quality, low capital costs and low cash operating costs allow us to have a peer-leading recycle ratio, and therefore grow production faster per dollar of CapEx without compromising our balance sheet. We consider ourselves fundamental investors and continually work to grow EBITDA per share and generate true earnings per share growth in an industry not known for EPS growth, especially through a commodity downturn. Looking forward, we will continue to value fundamentals to drive long-term shareholder value. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Take you, Travis. Diamondback has had another great quarter. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the effort and hard work that all of the Diamondback employees continue to exhibit. It is through their tireless pursuit for excellence and focus on detail that we have been able to outperform expectations quarter-over-quarter. Turning to slide 11, during the first quarter, Diamondback generated $21 million of free cash flow and has maintained capital discipline by growing production 67% over the last five quarters, while generating $90 million of EBITDA in excess of our CapEx over the same period. Diamondback plans to maintain this level of capital discipline in the coming years by continuing to add rigs only as cash flow allows. Turning ahead to slide 13, we continue to be industry leaders in terms of both cash costs and cash margins with the first quarter representing a company record in terms of realized cash margin at over 83%. Our investments in infrastructure, especially in the Delaware Basin over the last 24 months, have enabled us to increase realizations and decrease LOEs sooner than originally expected. Slides 15 through 18 give more detail on our Delaware Basin operations, infrastructure investments and continued improving well results. Since the acquisitions we made in 2016, we've increased our average working interest by over 10% on these properties and added over 5,000 net acres, a credit to our outstanding land team. We had new data from multiple well results across these assets, including three 90-day IPs that demonstrate the strong extended performance of the wells in the area. We also announced a successful test of an emerging new zone in Reeves County, the Third Bone Spring shale. As seen on slides 16 and 17, we have the majority of all oil and gas as well as fresh and saltwater on pipe across both of these positions and full field electrification will lower our ESP power generation cost by $60,000 per well per month when in place throughout the second half of 2018. As I mentioned before, the infrastructure investments we have made across these acreage positions are beginning to show benefits via higher realizations and lower LOE. Turning to the Midland Basin on slide 19, we're currently running six rigs and three completion crews. Two of these crews are currently using local sand. This will result in savings of $60 per foot versus current first quarter costs. We expect to use local sand for all Midland Basin completions beginning in the summer. Also, on slide 19, we discuss our continued shift to larger pads and multi-zone development across the Midland Basin having recently completed our second eight-well pad in Spanish Trail and flowing back our first seven-well pad in Glasscock County. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's first quarter 2018 net income was $1.65 per diluted share and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives and other items is $1.64 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $341 million, up 13% quarter-over-quarter, with cash operating costs at $8.42 per boe. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $275 million on drilling, completion and non-operated properties and $43 million on infrastructure and midstream investments. For the quarter, we generated $21 million of free cash flow, including acquisitions, and have now cash flowed the business in aggregate for the past 13 quarters. As shown on slide 21, Diamondback ended the first quarter of 2018 with a net debt to Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times and roughly $800 million of liquidity. In connection with our spring redetermination expected to close later this month, the lead bank of Diamondback's credit facility recommended a borrowing base increase to $2 billion from $1.8 billion, while we intend to limit the lenders aggregate commitment to $1 billion. We raised the bottom end of our full year 2018 production guidance to 110,000 boe a day with the top end remaining unchanged at 116,000 boe per day. The midpoint of our updated production guidance now implies 43% year-over-year growth. Finally, Diamondback's board of directors has declared a cash dividend for the first quarter of $0.125 per common share payable on May 29, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another great quarter as a result of our continued commitment to execution and low-cost operations. We're increasing production guidance, while maintaining capital spend and lowering cash operating costs for the year. Diamondback will remain proactive in all aspects of our business, including leveraging our size and scale to secure smart marketing agreements that position us well for both the near and long-term. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann from SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal D. Dingmann: Morning, all. Nice results. Travis, the question I have is looking at slide 14 were you showed sort of your balance inventory. Given that great result you had in that Third Bone in the Reeves, any thoughts on just space. I'm looking particular at the space in there. You guys are still pretty conservative. I know that's always been management style but I'm just wondering do you see more upside after seeing the size of that recent well. Travis D. Stice: Yes. Certainly, we're encouraged about that. Most of the commentary you've heard out of that portion of the basin has been from the Third Bone Springs sand. And this is really the first that we tested the shale. And it's really good results. We didn't count that as any kind of inventory at the acquisition time and we don't include it as inventory in our go-forward plan either. So certainly good well results like this lend us to the more aggressive future development but right now we're just going to continue to gather data on it. But yeah, we're excited about it and it has positive ramifications for inventory long-term. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. And then just one follow-up for you or Kaes. Just on that comment you mentioned about majority \u2013 going forward you suspect the majority of your production could be exposed to international market. I mean any other color you can give on how you might accomplish that. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Neal, this Gray Oak deal is the first step of many we're looking to take to over the long-term expose all our barrels to the international market. I think getting our barrels on a ship will get us a global price and remove the differential risk that we've seen rear its ugly head here in the last three months. So this is the first step of many and we look forward to announcing multiple other deals over the coming quarters as we look to diversify away from the Midland market. Neal D. Dingmann: Thanks, guys. Look forward to all that activity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. David Kistler : Good morning, guys, and great work on the quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Dave. David Kistler : Specifically looking at your slide 6 here and the comment that 50% of the production is firm in 2018 in terms of I guess firm transport, and then in 2019 45,000 barrels are firm. Can you give us some details or a little bit more color around exactly what those contracts look like and the destination for that crude? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Dave. These are all Midland-based prices. I think the term firm has been thrown around a lot lately. We have access via all the in-basin pipelines to get our barrels where they need to go and have deals in place for all barrels for third-party marketers to market downstream. In this case, these contracts are a little stronger than your traditional term sales agreement. It's a firm sales agreement. And what we're trying to do here is, these are exposed to the Midland market, but we will be adding deals that are exposed to other markets over the near and long-term. David Kistler : Okay. And not to press too hard on something you probably can't share too much details on, but any color you could share. You mentioned the ability to maybe use the Gray Oak contract or leverage the Gray Oak contract to secure near-term capacity. Just trying to understand, would you be looking at swapping out some of the firm commitment you've put in place there? Or through the relationship with the folks at Gray Oak, does that help you secure potential available capacity that in your words is term versus firm from some folks potentially? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I'll put it a little differently. Diamondback \u2013 we're not a marketing company, but what we did with the Gray Oak pipeline is we're essentially taking our barrels one step further. So at the end of the day, those barrels need to be marketed by one of the larger international marketing firms that we have great relationships with and have been doing business with throughout the last six years as a public company. So that 50,000 barrel a day commitment is a very enticing, sizable commitment for someone to market over the next multiple years after we make that commitment. So in exchange for that, we might pay up for secured firm transport in the near-term, but I'm looking to exchange that for someone to come in and market those barrels long-term for us. David Kistler : Okay. Great. If I can sneak one last one in here. Given what's happened with Mid-Cush diffs, does that potentially change sort of the dynamics of the acquisition market as we look at some people who might be suffering from compression of price realization, and maybe free up some incremental or differentiated assets that you guys would be interested over time? I'm just curious how you think this shapes the acquisition market. Travis D. Stice: Certainly, Dave. As it continues to evolve, we take all that into our acquisition model as we price future cash flows and then discount them forward. So yeah, it could, but we're just going to be continued to use our disciplined approach on acquisitions, and we'll evaluate all the deals with what the current market conditions are, and we'll respond accordingly as we look for accretion in these deals. And, Dave, just on the acquisitions, Diamondback currently, we're not more interested or less interested in acquisitions than we've ever been in our company's history. M&A activity is as fundamental to Diamondback Energy as the air that we breathe. It's something that we've done from day one, and we're going to continue to demonstrate that discipline in looking for accretion and looking for ways that we can deliver differential results to our shareholders. That's one of the reasons that we put that slide in there on page 7 is to say we've got a good track record of doing smart deals for our shareholders. And so that's the way we always behave, Dave. David Kistler : Travis, thanks for the added color, and I appreciate the ongoing discipline. Travis D. Stice: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is open. Robert Scott Morris : Thank you. Nice quarter, Travis, and everyone there. Travis, when you laid out the full year budget, you assumed in that budget around 12% year-over-year cost inflation in the Midland and about 17% in the Delaware Basin. Is that what you still expect? Or given the discipline amongst your peers also out there, do you think that inflation's likely to come in lower than that at this point as you look forward? Travis D. Stice: I think we're going to continue to see, Bob, the cost increases over time as activity level continues to continue to go forward. So I can't speak for what our peers are going to do, but I can say that we continue to be disciplined in how we allocate capital dollars and we're not a big proponent of the kind of the drill, baby, drill mentality, out-spending cash flow. So I can just tell you how Diamondback's going to perform, and I think we've got a good handle on what we think service costs are going to do over the next couple of quarters. Robert Scott Morris : So you would still stick to that 12% to 17% inflation expectation here, as you look to add rigs going through the year? That would still be part of your budget or you still think that's accurate? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Bob, I think it's too early to change that based on what we've seen so far this year. The one benefit we do have is we were one of the first E&P operators to sign up for a local sand deal, and we're getting a lot more local sand than we expected earlier in the year. So that should save $60 a foot for our Midland Basin well costs. And by midyear all of our Midland Basin wells will be using local sand, saving about $60 a foot versus our current well cost. Robert Scott Morris : Yeah. That's been a great move by you guys and a big positive. My second question is just as you look to match activity with cash flow, how quickly can you add rigs and completion crews? Is it just physically one rig and maybe a crew every quarter? Or how quickly, if free cash flow continues to ramp up, how quickly can you ramp activity? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Bob. We did our budget at $55 a barrel at the beginning of the year, and we anticipated at that pricing even with differentials at $3 or $4 at the beginning of the year that we could add a rig every four or five months. And I think we're probably sticking to that type timeframe. We added Rig 11 in Q1, and I'd anticipate Rig 12 on its way sometime mid-summer. Robert Scott Morris : Okay. Great. Thank you and again nice quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with KLR Group. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Looking at the working interest adjustment in the dollar since the announcement of the acquisition you're up 10%. How do you kind of see that landscape going further? Do you think there's more room for trades in (21:19), the Delaware? Or do you kind of feel like where you sit, an 82% working interest is a good kind of run-rate to use? Travis D. Stice: Gail, that's a good question, but I'll tell you that's a fundamental part of each of the asset teams in the area. They do that day in and day out, and the expectations they take are that they're their own little business development teams. And they continue to look for ways that creatively can add swap acreage or purchase small bolt-on deals. Again, it's just as fundamental as a part of businesses as taking leases and drilling wells. Gail Nicholson : And then, with the nice initial result in the Third Bone Spring shale potentially being inventory add in the Delaware, some of your peers in the Midland have been having some good Jo Mill results in and around your acreage, kind of, soften up your potential zones over in the Midland? Paul S. Molnar: We're looking \u2013 this is Paul Molnar \u2013 we're also looking at the Middle Spraberry shale, Jo Mill. We've focused on the highest rate of return projects in each area, but we are testing other zones ourselves and also we're monitoring the results of our offset operators drilling. So we anticipate additional inventory as these zones get proven up. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Gail, again, we've always been known as a fast follower and we intend to be fast followers as we see other zones de-risk. Gail Nicholson : And then just one more on the locally-sourced sand. I know that's where you're moving towards in the Midland, and you previously said that you were not willing to test it in the Delaware at this point in time. There has been some operators utilizing that locally-sourced sand in and around your area. Any revised thoughts on the use of locally-sourced sand over in the Delaware? Paul S. Molnar: Yeah, Gail. We actually use some hundred mesh locally-sourced over in the Delaware as well as we're looking for a test this quarter. We'll test some local sand in the Wolfcamp A in the Pecos County area. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you so much. Paul S. Molnar: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp, Northland Capital. Your line is open. Jeff Grampp : Morning, guys. Was curious to get your thoughts on general, I guess, average pad sizes for you guys. It seems like you're incrementally kind of moving up, doing some seven and eight-well pads. And as you guys continue to grow and add to activity, you mentioned 12 rigs by midsummer, how do you guys kind of think about average pad size potentially changing going forward? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I think the testing that the asset teams continue to do with bigger and bigger pad sizes will probably move more towards that four to eight-well pad development if we're doing two zones and kind of do the one rack staggering on as we go forward. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Great. And then, on the cost side, you guys reduced your unit LOE. Can you talk a little bit about any particular drivers in that? Is that maybe some of these infrastructure projects in the Delaware coming on later this year? I guess is there anything noteworthy that might be driving those costs so up. Paul S. Molnar: Sure, Jeff. The infrastructure projects are the biggest drivers over in the Delaware Basin. Getting all of our fluids on pipe are really helping us to reduce the LOE cost, as well as realizations. What we're also seeing, of course, is production growth helping on the denominator of that equation. But going forward, the electrification that's about to happen over in the Delaware floor is going to be a big driver. It gives us the confidence to lower our LOE guide for the rest of the year. Jeff Grampp : Okay. And if I can sneak one more on the realization side in the Delaware, do you guys have maybe a rough split on how your oil production is weighted between Midland and Delaware just to, I guess, get a better sense of on a corporate level how your realizations might change? Kaes Van' t Hof : About three-quarter is Midland, a quarter Delaware at this time. The Delaware is going to continue to pick up steam as we now have five rigs running there full time. Jeff Grampp : Okay. Perfect. Thanks for your time, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Michael Dugan Kelly : Thanks. Good morning. Hey, guys. I wanted to just go back to the marketing side of things here, make sure I'm looking at this the right way. So today it looks like you don't have any barrels that are getting international pricing, but in your comments here it sounds like you'll soon have the majority of your near-term barrels exposed to international pricing, if I heard that right. So I think my question on this is just one on the timing. When should we kind of feather these barrels in for international pricing? Just get a sense of that. And then, obviously, I mean, if you're taking a $13 hit on Midland pricing today, getting international pricing is going to be very attractive. I'd imagine you're going to have to pay a decent cost to make that happen. Just kind of wanted to get a sense on how we should think about that transport cost in order to make that arrangement feasible. Thanks. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Mike. It's tough for me to comment on deals in progress, but I can assure you that there are multiple deals we are working to increase the international pricing exposure, granted you will have to pay up for it. I think it'll be somewhere between where the Midland market is today and international market is today. But, obviously, we can't comment, but the one thing I can say is that the attractiveness of our 50,000-barrel-a-day commitment among other commitments we're looking to make do allow us to talk \u2013 use our scale and talk about an interim solution, granted it's going to be a more expensive solution, just less expensive than the cash market we're seeing today. Michael Dugan Kelly : What do you think if we look out to maybe like Q4 this year, what's ideal for you? How much of your crude is exposed to Midland pricing versus more international? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Mike. As we get some more clarity around all those, we'll be very fulsome on our disclosure, just not prudent to speculate on deals in progress right now. Michael Dugan Kelly : Yeah, fair enough. And, Travis, one for you. I mean, we've got two press releases out from you guys now just stressing the discipline on the M&A front. And would just like to hear maybe a little more insight into your acquisition model and maybe some of the core tenets of that disciplined approach. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Those core tenets have never really changed. Specifically, the acquisition has to compete for capital immediately. We're not going to buy something and then park it in inventory. It has to be accretive on the measures that we care about, and it needs to be complementary to our existing asset base and some of the other things that we manage around here with our infrastructure and our mineral business. So it's not particularly complicated, but there's a lot of brilliance in the simplicity of just doing accretive deals that are smart for our shareholders. Michael Dugan Kelly : Yes. Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles A. Meade: Good morning, Travis, to you and your team. I wanted to go back to that Rogers 6 Unit well, the Third Bone Spring shale and I want a just brief commentary that shale versus sand subtlety may be lost on some of the investment community. But anyway, I wanted to ask if you could give a narrative on how the case to drill that well and land that well where you did, how that case came together, and if what you've seen in the early days from this well has you now looking perhaps further up the column in the Delaware in the First and Second Bone Spring sections. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I'll let Paul answer on the geoscience about the decision to land that. But I'll tell you, we're very judicious in how we move away from the highest rate of return zones. And I think it's reasonable to expect that the vast majority of our future development in the Delaware is going to remain in the Wolfcamp A interval. But, Paul, on the decision to land it in the shale interval? Paul S. Molnar: Right. That was based on a combination of core data and petrophysical log data. There were a few other operators in the general area about the same time, looked like they had the same idea. There's been a few other tests that also seem to have pretty good results in this zone. We know the Third Bone Spring sand is prolific to the northwest of us. The thing we wanted to avoid was drilling that first before you drill the Wolfcamp A because the Wolfcamp A is over-pressured and there could be issues with developing the Wolfcamp A after the Third Bone sand. You want to drill the Wolfcamp A either first or co-develop the two zones. We wanted to test the Third Bone shale. It's equivalent actually to the Lower Spraberry shale in the Midland Basin. And again, we're very pleased with the results. But yes, we have additional information at future tests in some of the shallower Bone Spring zones, as you mentioned, the First and Second may be succumbing somewhere down the line. Charles A. Meade: Okay. Thanks for that detail. And then perhaps I think there was some talk that you guys were looking to perhaps farm out some of your more southern Pecos acreage to maybe promote in a partner. Is there any update on that? Or maybe you don't have any of these recent good Wolfcamp wells in Pecos County changed your appetite there? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Charles, can't comment on processes in place. I will say a few things about that process is some acreage on our southeast portion of our Pecos County locked. And we're looking for a partner to help us develop it and bring some value forward as that acreage kind of sits in the lower quartile of our inventory. I think it also provides a benefit to our midstream business as well as our minerals business. Charles A. Meade: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jason Wangler : Hi. Morning, guys. I just had one thought as I think you guys have spoken on with Viper as well, looking at the drop down at some point. Assuming you guys would get cash from that type of transaction, where would you look to deploy that given you guys are running at free cash flow and don't really have any debt need, just kind of the thought process on use of proceeds if something does come to transpire? Kaes Van' t Hof : That's a good conversation that we're looking to have. Traditionally that extra cash would primarily go to debt reduction on a revolver and then on top of that potential acceleration which would then benefit the Viper minerals and the parent company. Jason Wangler : Okay. And then, Kaes, just kind of dovetailing on the last question, it sounds like I guess Viper may have some of the minerals sitting under that acreage that you're looking to farm out from the Diamondback side. Is that right? Kaes Van' t Hof : It's safe to assume that Viper is looking to acquire under everywhere Diamondback has acreage. Jason Wangler : Okay. I appreciate it. I'll turn it back. Travis D. Stice: Thanks. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Travis and team, great quarter. Two quick questions for you. You spoke a little earlier about it's too early at this point to look at potentially change in the cost expectations for 2018 wells, currently have budgeted 12% to 17% cost inflation. Can you talk a little bit about what's been the inflation experience to-date in your AFEs? Paul S. Molnar: Richard, we're in that 5% to 7% range today. Rigs and a few other things are moving. We're seeing a little bit of tightness. We also have some things happening throughout the year, the sand getting utilized against all three of our frac trees on Midland side. We're beginning to help that as well. There's a few things out in the future that we're looking at as far as steel tariffs and some other things that we don't have full clarity on. So to go and change our estimate today is a little premature but we did take in account that we would have it basically Jan 1 through the whole year. That hasn't been the case to-date but again we still have a lot of time left in the year. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Richard, just add to that. You know Diamondback's philosophy on cost increases. We're not willing to get back any ground and so we're continuing to push the efficiency envelope everywhere we can. And the expectation is that we always offset cost increases with improved efficiencies and it's not always practical but that's still our basic operating philosophy. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thank you. That's helpful, Travis. And just lastly, you had a nice uptick in cash margin for the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what your margins have been to-date in this quarter? And just how comfortable are you in being able to maintain that sort of cash margin level that you saw in the first quarter? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think we feel very good about the cost side and the unit cost. As oil price continues to increase and realizations increase, that margin should stay steady to increase. The only variable cost in that margin are the taxes we have to pay on the crude and that's based on a percentage of realized price. Richard Merlin Tullis : All right. Kaes, thanks a bunch. Appreciate it. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Richard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to hit on a few things. First on the acceleration, Kaes, that you've talked through of adding the 12th rig later this year, I'm just curious how you think about that in the context of the infrastructure constraints that the industry is facing in 2019, assuming that most of the uptick in activity later this year would impact 2019. How do you kind of balance those two things when in a normal world it would accelerate into the higher price environment but in this current scenario certain headwinds are obviously in place for 2019? Travis D. Stice: Michael, just like on my commentary on acquisitions, we evaluate all the cards face up on the table when we make these decisions. And if you've got midstream issues that are compounding our economic returns to our investors, we'll respond accordingly. It's up to us to like we talked about to fix those things and I anticipate we'll be doing that and be talking to you guys about it in the not-too-distant future. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And I guess then related, is there a Midland price discount that on its own would reduce your activity or is it really just \u2013 what's the overall corporate cash flow and underlying activity to that? Or is it independent... Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Michael, I'm not going to speculate on exact price point at which Diamondback is going to change behaviors. I think you can look at the way that we've historically managed the company and the balance sheet and we've done so in a very conservative way. And just like I've always said, when returns to our investors go up, we accelerate into that environment. And just like we demonstrated in the past, if returns go down, well, we pull back activity. So just more to come on that, Michael. We'll see. I'm anticipating the organization is going to \u2013 we'll have plenty of solutions, so just more to come. Michael Anthony Hall : Yeah, makes sense. Seems like you provided some good signals to us today anyways. And then I guess the last one \u2013 sorry. Go ahead. Travis D. Stice: Michael, I was just going to add to that. I mean, if you look at \u2013 we're clearly at the highest percentage of cash margins this quarter. Our cash flow is at an all-time high, so we're really in great financial shape. We've cash flowed the company now in aggregate for 13 quarters in a row. So we've got a lot of really positive things happening on the financial side of our business as well. Kaes Van' t Hof : I'll add a few things to that. Looking at 2017, we grew production 85% year-over-year within cash flow at below $50 crude for the year. And we ran our budget this year at $55 crude less $3 diffs and said we're going to grow 40% within cash flow at $1.4 billion budget. So I think we feel very comfortable about those numbers with WTI at $70 today. Michael Anthony Hall : That's very clear. I appreciate it. One last one little one on my end. Can you just clarify the differences between term and firm as you think about it and describe it in the deck? I just want to make sure we're all thinking about it. Kaes Van' t Hof : My opinion of a firm deal is a true take-or-pay deal. If you don't use it you pay. Term deals are deals that you can flow crude and you have a deal with someone, but I think a firm deal supersedes a term deal in the so-called oil capital structure. Michael Anthony Hall : And in the term case, I guess, what assurance do you have that the buyer will take those barrels? Is that the primary difference I guess between the two? Kaes Van' t Hof : That would be my opinion. Michael Anthony Hall : All right. Perfect. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to, Adam Lawlis, Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Mark. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's second quarter 2018 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's second quarter 2018 conference call. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Diamondback as we continued our operational excellence by growing production 10% quarter-over-quarter and maintaining a cash margin of over 82%. Separately, I'm excited to announce the acquisition of all the assets of Ajax Resources for $900 million in cash and 2.5 million shares of Diamondback stock. This acquisition adds over 25,000 net acres physically adjacent to our existing acreage in Northwest Martin and Northeast Andrews county, and more than doubles our Tier 1 inventory in this area with the addition of 220 net locations with IRRs of 100% or greater at $60 oil. In addition to outstanding well results in the emerging zones for the area across this acreage block, Diamondback's operations will benefit from multiple synergies from this transaction. We currently operate about 1,000 net acres of Ajax's acreage, and our existing position is physically adjacent to 6,500 acres of the Ajax acreage allowing for operational efficiencies via existing and shared infrastructure assets. Also, net revenue interest above 75% provides a potential future drop-down opportunity for Viper. Lastly, the acreage is almost 90% held by production, which will allow for efficient development with large-scale multi-zone pads. This acquisition checks every box we look for at Diamondback : a sizable, blocky acreage position with inventory in the top quartile of our existing portfolio; wells that are set up for long lateral development with existing production and infrastructure, allowing for immediate development. Also, the existing production and anticipated development plan makes the acquisition accretive on all per share metrics. Slides 8 through 13 lay out the details of the acreage position, and the impact on our existing inventory in the area. Ajax tested the Middle Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A, both emerging zones for the area, and the results show these two zones competing with the Lower Spraberry for capital immediately. As a result, and due to the held-by production nature of the acreage, we are planning to develop the acreage with 12-plus well pads, targeting the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry, and Wolfcamp A, simultaneously. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. I would like to start-off by congratulating all the Diamondback employees and our strategic business partners for another great quarter. They make our job easy in telling the Diamondback story. It's truly a privilege to work alongside such a professional and hard working group. Moving ahead to slide 16 through 18, we give an update to our takeaway strategy. In terms of in-basin transportation, we currently have over 92% of our total production on pipe moving to 95% or higher by the end of the year, removing the risk of rising trucking costs from our forward operating plan. Now, in terms of out of basin transportation, for the remainder of 2018, we have firm transportation agreements in place that cover the majority of our gross production at fixed discounts to Gulf Coast pricing. These arrangements provide a true flow assurance for our barrels and provide insulation from differentials that may continue to widen. Effective for the full year 2019, we will still have the majority of our gross production covered by firm transport deals, but the pricing terms will become more favorable than in 2018. These agreements will continue into 2020 and beyond when we will have 100% of our oil production protected via firm transportation to Gulf Coast markets. We see this as a true wellhead to water solution that eliminates risk of illiquid onshore U.S. market volatility. On the gas side, as shown on slide 18, we have dedicated gatherers and processors that have secured downstream firm and/or Diamondback has take-in-kind rights. Although, our gas will remain exposed to the WAHA basis, we will continue to have flow assurance. It is important to highlight that gas production represents less than 5% of our total revenue. As seen on slides 20 and 21, the infrastructure investments we have made across our positions, mainly on our Delaware Basin acreage, are beginning to show benefits via higher realizations and lower LOE. We have the majority of all oil and gas, fresh and saltwater on pipe across both of these positions and full field electrification will lower our ESP power generation cost by upto $60,000 per month per well when in place throughout the second half of 2018. Turning ahead to slide 23, Diamondback continues to focus on growing per share earnings and maximizing corporate level returns. Our cost structure and disciplined approach to investment facilitates greater per share EBITDA and earnings growth, and is reflected in our industry-leading return on average capital employed. We believe our current acquisition of Ajax will help facilitate this strategy further. Slide 26 shows that Diamondback completed a record 465,000 lateral feet across our portfolio this quarter, up 72% from 2Q 2017. We continue to maximize long laterals and efficient pad development across our acreage. Longer laterals improve capital efficiency, and pad development reduces cost for both drilling and completions. We also believe that efficient pad development aids in maximizing ultimate recoveries and reduces PD F&D. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's second quarter 2018 net income was $2.22 per diluted share, and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives and other items was $1.59 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $370 million, up 9% quarter-over-quarter, with our cash operating costs of $8.83 per BOE. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $338 million on drilling and completion in non-operated property, and $88 million on infrastructure and midstream investments. For the first half of 2018, we generated $20 million of free cash flow excluding acquisitions, and have now cash flow to business in aggregate for the past 14 quarters. As shown on slide 29, Diamondback ended the second quarter of 2018 with a net debt to Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times, and roughly $760 million of liquidity. We intend to fund the cash portion of the Ajax acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the previously announced drop down of mineral interests to Viper, and a combination of borrowings under our revolver, and capital market transactions which may include a debt offering. As a result of continuing volume outperformance and a small production contribution from our acquisition of Ajax, which is expected to close at the end of October, we have decided to raise our full year 2018 production guidance to a range of 115,000 boe to 119,000 boe a day. At the midpoint, this represents a 4% increase over our prior guidance, and implies over 45% year-over-year growth. Finally, Diamondback's Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend for the second quarter of $0.125 per common share payable on August 27, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business August 20, 2018. I'll now turn the call back over to Travis. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Tracy. Diamondback was able to deliver another great quarter as a result of our continued commitment to execution and low cost operations. We are increasing production guidance while maintaining our capital budget, and look forward to integrating our latest accretive acquisition. Diamondback will remain proactive in all aspects of our business, including leveraging our size and scale to secure smart marketing agreements that position us well for both the near and the long-term. Operator, please open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, all. Travis, a question for you, and the team, on the Ajax deal, when you're talking about the accretion behind this, can you talk about how you're thinking about besides the 12,000 barrels a day of existing production, could you maybe talk about some color about how quickly you all intend or believe you can ramp production around this, as I believe you said there was already a potentially a 6-well or soon to be 12-well pad and \u2013 as well as kind of how many rigs you plan on running down the area? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Neal, a good question. When you look specifically at the asset, and what's going on, now there's one rig that's operated by Ajax. Again, we don't close the acquisition till the 31st. And working with the Ajax team, they're on fourth well of the pad, and we're going to get them to continue drilling up until you get a 12-well pad. So this rig will stay operating through the first quarter on that pad of 2019, and we'll look into 2019 and potentially picking a second rig up on this acreage depending on rest of our capital allocation decisions based on our cash flow. So the volume impact ramping from here will be a 2019 event. Neal D. Dingmann: Very good. And then just one follow up. Either in the Ajax or maybe even if you look at some of your Delaware areas, as in Pecos and Reeves or Ward, could you talk about maybe plans? I know previously even up to this point, you've been doing mostly sort of single-zone, focusing on the Bs and such. Can you talk about plans for more upcoming multi-zone pads either for Ajax or some of these other areas? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, as I laid out in my prepared remarks for Ajax, we're going to immediately begin developing three zones, the Middle Spraberry, Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A. On our legacy assets on the Midland Basin side, we've been developing multi-zones in the Lower Spraberry and Wolfcamp A and will continue to push that envelope to do more rather than less. And on the Delaware, again, we're still primarily drilling obligations that are satisfied through the Wolfcamp A. Now, we're drilling multi-wells certainly per pad, but they're really focused now on the Wolfcamp A to address the lease obligations. Neal D. Dingmann: Very good. Thanks very much. Congrats on the deal. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Neal. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Nelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. John Nelson : Good morning. Congratulations on the Ajax deal and the Rattler's progression. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, John. John Nelson : Travis, while the midpoint of 2018 CapEx guidance moved up, it was pretty modest relative to some of your peers and seem to actually be more kind of midstream focused. Can you speak to what kind of pricing pressures you're seeing in the field, and if you think that's sustainable for Diamondback to continue to hold the line on cost relative to peers? Travis D. Stice: Well, certainly Diamondback always maintains pressure on costs, whether it's relative to peers or not, that's just the way that we operate our business. But when you look specifically at what happened in the quarter, on the Midland Basin side, our cost quarter-over-quarter were actually down $50 to $60 a foot, primarily on the completion side due to the full scale implementation of regional sand. And that's going to continue in the back half of this year, and we're beginning testing in the Delaware Basin side also on the regional sand. So even though, quarter-over-quarter in the Delaware, costs are flat. If regional sand continues to work in the Delaware, we could probably see some downward pressure on pricing. Also, I know that just from a surplus availability, primarily on the pressure pumping that we're certainly not dialing in any cost increases on the back half of this year, and I think, our operations organization continues to push the envelope on efficient execution of our development plan and holding costs. So we feel really comfortable about our cost projection. And you're right, it was \u2013 2Q was heavily dominated by infrastructure costs, and that's not an equally quarter-loaded event. So we've taken all that into account in our latest CapEx guide. John Nelson : I guess, just to build on, some folks have kind of commented on labor. You guys are in the basin day-to-day; can you just speak to how congested or tight both the labor and service pool market kind of feel down in the Permian today? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, the guys that are a little closer to that on a business partners on the service side probably can give you the best commentary on that. I can just talk from a macro sense that, labor is tight here in the Permian, and that usually translates to the higher wages. And we're seeing that, but the wages as a percent of the total well is actually a pretty small piece. So wages are going up, that's a good thing for workers out here. That allows us to attract more and more workers. But in terms of how that affects my overall economics, it's a pretty de minimis effect. John Nelson : That's helpful. And then the release just highlighted that you plan to add a 12th and 13th rig in 3Q; I'm guessing one of those two is the Ajax rig. Just where does the other rig go to? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. No, that doesn't include the Ajax rig. That rig \u2013 we'll just assume that rig in November 1 when we take over operations. What we're trying to do is, get a jump on some obligations in the Delaware. So that 13th rig is the 7th rig in the Delaware Basin right now, and just keeping ahead of some obligations we have in 2019. Michael L. Hollis: So, from a cadence perspective, we're going to stay at five crews. We added our fifth crew in Q2, and we're going to stay at that five-crew pace for the rest of 2018. John Nelson : Great. Congrats again. I'll let somebody else hop on. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, John. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Asit Sen of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So on the addition of the two rigs in 3Q, it looks like, Travis, you talked about the reasoning for that. Now, previously you've talked about the optimal level of roughly 16 to 18 rigs on your acreage. Could you update on your thought process there? And then, average pad size clearly is going to go up; any thought of 2019 versus 2018 on average pad size? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I'll answer those in reverse. We've not really provided any color or commentary on 2019, yet. Those comments will be coming. But in general, we've said in each quarter that we're seeing more and more wells per development unit seems to be best for EUR and best for cost efficiencies as well. So I think you'll continue to see that trend move up. And then, we've typically guided \u2013 historically guided to kind of that 16 to 18 rig cadence, and notionally without accounting for efficiency improvements, that would move up by 1 to 2 rigs with the addition of these 25,000 acres associated with the Ajax acquisition. Asit Sen : Great. And Travis, one of your peers noted higher line pressure issues in the Midland Basin, are you seeing similar issues? Michael L. Hollis: Asit, the only time we've seen that is, we've had some downstream processing plants to do some upgrades and some line loops. And that's generally the only time we'll see any kind of changes in line pressure. In general, these guys are staying out in front of us, so not really seeing an issue at this point. Asit Sen : Great. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Michael Dugan Kelly : Hey, guys. Good morning. Travis, curious post the Ajax deal here, do you look to hit the pause button on the M&A front? Are you still very, very active assessing deals there? And then just, you laid out too that there might be some transactions here, a potential debt raise to fund this. Are you contemplating any equity alongside that too? We've gotten that question this morning. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Mike no, we're not contemplating any equity associated with this trade. You've heard me say multiple times that in the business development, in the M&A world, you're either in the game or you're out of the game. And I think it's fair to say that Diamondback's going to remain in the game. And if we can find acquisitions like this Ajax trade that touches all the levers we care about, we're going to continue to bring that value forward to our investors. I mean, if you look specifically at the Ajax trade, the geos or geoscience team, they loved it because there's a sweet spot for the Wolfcamp A and the Middle Spraberry in addition to the Lower Spraberry, which we already knew about it. The operations guys love it because it's the easiest drill in our portfolio, and it's physically adjacent to 6,500 acres of our stuff, which makes all the facilities easier. The Viper guys love it, because not only do they have a new playground to go buy minerals underneath Diamondback now, there's also a couple of percentage points above the 75% that represent additional drop down. And the Rattler guys love it because there's new surface facility that get included in their toolbox. And then this wasn't a brokered deal, and as I mentioned, we're not doing equity, so everybody loves it because there's not going to be any banker fees associated with this trade. So those are the type of things that we're going to continue to look for. Michael Dugan Kelly : Got it. Checks a lot of boxes except that broker fee part. But, Travis, switching over to the Rattler, I mean, lot of good slides here to lay out that opportunity. Maybe you could just kind of frame this up for us little bit in terms of the ultimate value proposition to FANG's shareholders and really kind of what the playbook is here going forward? Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Mike, I'd love to talk chapter and verse about the Rattler Midstream, but we filed that publicly with the SEC and all the information is in that S-1, and we're in that quiet period and I really can't comment on any of the details. But I encourage you to hit the SEC website and look at all the information in the box that we included. Michael Dugan Kelly : Yeah, fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys. Bye. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson of KLR Group. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Just help in going to the regional sand testing in the Delaware, how much data do you guys need to collect before you kind of make that switch if you choose to make that switch? And do you think that the cost savings would be similar to what you guys saw when you guys made that switch into the Midland? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, Gail. So over in the Delaware side, we pump more pound per foot of the sand. So if we were able to go to a full-scale local sand usage, you'll actually get a higher dollar per foot change on the Delaware than you do on the Midland side. We're pumping local 100 mesh. We're already pumping that in the Delaware. We've got a couple of tests coming up, we will try it. We've got a bunch -our several offset operators who are watching and working with that have done it as well. So the data set is coming, and it's looking very favorable to be able to do that. But you'll have a bigger effect over the Delaware than it'd be in Midland. Gail Nicholson : And then, you guys just continue, I think to get more and more efficient. Can you just talk about where you guys are today from the standpoint of, how many wells per rig per annum you drill versus where you guys were 12 months ago, and also from the standpoint of completion, how quickly you complete a well today versus 12 months ago, just so we can kind of conceptualize those efficiency gains? Travis D. Stice: You bet. And we've scaled the business pretty significantly in the last year as well. But in general on the Midland Basin side, we complete or we drill roughly 22 wells per rig per year, and we drill longer and longer laterals on average each year, so that 22 is a good number for now. On the Delaware side, it's closer to 13 to 15. Again, it depends on length and which area we're actually drilling in. On the completion side, Midland hitting on all eight cylinders as they have been for several years, and we're always adjusting size of the job slightly so that has an effect on how many stages you can get in at a day. So again, you move over to the Delaware where we have a larger loading of fluid and sand per foot. So there we do a little bit less footage per day per frac crew, but again that continues to accelerate every quarter. So from a baseball analogy, I would say we're probably in the fifth inning on Midland Basin side and probably third or fourth inning over on the Delaware side, so still a lot more to come. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then you guys talked about potentially doing a debt offering in order to pay for a portion of the cash part of the Ajax acquisition. When you look at just where you are in the portfolio with the incremental high-quality inventory you picked up before Ajax, is there any thoughts about any portfolio optimization on your existing asset base, and maybe selling some lesser quality areas in order to fund the Ajax? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, that's certainly something that's always part of our portfolio decisions, and really irrespective of the Ajax acquisition, we think that we want to always try to high grade our inventory, whether it's in the form of creaming off the stuff that has very little present value because it's late in time, and whether we use those proceeds to fund an acquisition or not. I think that's just good prudent capital allocation. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp of Northland Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Grampp : Good morning, guys. Was curious on the Ajax acquisition, that area overall. It looks like that represents kind of, I guess, the majority of your Midland inventory now, so can you guys just kind of talk about rig allocation there? I think, you mentioned one to two rigs. But can you clarify that's just on the Ajax piece or is that the entirety of that kind of Northeastern Andrews, Northwestern Martin area for you guys? And then can you also touch on any infrastructure investments that might make sense on the Rattler side as you integrate Ajax? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, so the comment of 1 to 2 rigs was just on the newly-acquired acreage. We're going to run 1 to 2 on our legacy acreage up there. So something in that 2 to 4 rig on a go-forward basis for that portion of our inventory. And look, as I already mentioned the economics of that really dictates that it draws rigs because it has such a high rate of return on an individual well basis. And on the infrastructure side, luckily the asset comes with enough SWD infrastructure and fresh water infrastructure to support our existing needs. We have a good amount of fresh water and SWD infrastructure already up there. So the synergies are very present with this trade. It gives our operations team a lot of flexibility on the fresh water side. We can connect the saltwater disposal systems to flow barrels where we need to flow them, and it also sets up well for \u2013 as Travis mentioned earlier the 12-well pad development across three zones both on the existing inventory and now the new pro forma inventory with Ajax. Jeff Grampp : All right. Great, that's helpful. And then can you guys talk a little bit more about, you're behind a couple of rigs here, but electing not to add a frac crew. Is that \u2013 I guess seeing some more efficiencies on the frac side where you can \u2013 those can keep up with the increased rigs? Or if there's any maybe plans in the medium-term to add another frac crew? Travis D. Stice: Jeff, basically the rigs that we're picking at today, we're drilling multi-well pad. So really between now and the end of the year, we're not going to have a lot of DUCs that would come from those additional rigs. So again picking up that frac crew, and again whether it moves a month here or there, we're not going to appreciably change our DUC count. But picking it up early, again these wells have come in late in fourth quarter is when we move off the pad. So again, wouldn't change production in 2018. Jeff Grampp : Okay, great. That's helpful. I appreciate the comment, guys. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Juan Jarrah of TD Securities. Your line is now open. Juan Jarrah : Great. Thanks for taking my question, gentlemen; great acquisition. Obviously, it looks like it fits like a glove. Didn't pay a whole lot for it, which is awesome. A question to you is that, is this a read-through to future M&A in the Basin in terms of metrics? Was it just a good deal? And do you think there are more deals to be had like this one, maybe given some of the infrastructure bottlenecks? Travis D. Stice: Well, I certainly think J.J., that this was an area that we were probably most familiar with. I think, we had an information advantage. We've been looking at this area pretty hard for really the last couple years, and they participated in a couple of our wells, and we've had some data exchanges up there, and we're really interested in the work that they were doing in particularly the Middle Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A. So like you said, this one fits hand in glove, but it does kind of describe the characteristics that we look for in additional deals. And my track record is to never comment on deals until we have a deal. But this is a good example of what we're looking for. So to the extent there's other deals like that out there, Diamondback is going to continue to be in the game of building through accretive acquisitions. Juan Jarrah : Great. Appreciate that. Second question is on long-term takeaway. You're talking about call it 225,000 barrels of oil a day in the 2020 timeframe. Is that a good read through to where you think your oil production could go to say by say, year-end 2019 or 2020? Michael L. Hollis: I can't comment on 2019 or 2020 production, but certainly we are taking enough takeaways that our asset base will not have to deal with the issues that we're dealing with today by taking the space ourselves. It looks to be like \u2013 we'll be covered for a long time and protecting the growth plan while limiting our downside. Half of that's going to be take or pay, which is about what we're doing today on a gross barrels basis, so a lot of flexibility for us to scale up. Juan Jarrah : That's helpful. Last question, I did notice the last slide in your slide deck, you pushed back the Limelight appraisal back to 2019. Just curious as to what factors went into that decision? And that's it from me. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, with 95% of our oil on pipe and Limelight not being on pipe, with trucking costs where they are and diffs where they are, it's just not a priority at this time. So sometime in 2019 the geos will get their wish and we'll do our tests, but certainly from the economics perspective, we have our better money to put elsewhere in the basin right now. Juan Jarrah : Appreciate your time. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all, and congrats on a strong quarter and great acquisition. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Reading between the lines, it seems that you guys are incrementally positive on the Middle Spraberry following this acquisition in your geologic work. Can you remind me the de-risking assumptions for this interval across your legacy position and speak to what degree the geological data suggests there is upside to your inventory assumptions? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, it certainly changes our inventory assumptions in the Northeast Andrews and the Northwest Martin area, for the Middle Spraberry, it moves up the list. I think we see a lot of Middle Spraberry potential along the western portion of our acreage in the Midland Basin, and we've seen some testing further east, but certainly on the west side, we're testing it in Midland County, actually it's kind of in full development mode now in Midland County, and this pushes the Middle Spraberry further north into a northern portion of the play. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks. And as my follow up, referencing page 27 of the PowerPoint, could you comment on the strength of the State Biggs well? That's one of the most productive wells in that group, and also has the highest oil composition. Did you guys test a new landing zone within the lower Wolfcamp A? Travis D. Stice: No, it's just a really good well. Derrick Whitfield : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis D. Stice: You bet. Thank you, Derrick. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Appreciate the time. I guess, just on the \u2013 as you think about capital allocation after Ajax, and just kind of \u2013 if you were to try to rank across the portfolio, I guess, how do you think about relative returns across the portfolio, and in that context, how should we think about rig allocation across the portfolio as we move forward post-Ajax? Travis D. Stice: Well, certainly the commentary that I've been using that this fits in the top quartile of our portfolio gives you a pretty good idea of where the Ajax 225 locations sit plus the other locations that are on our legacy assets. So one of the earlier questions was getting up to that 16-plus rig cadence, and we still intend, Michael, to have pretty equal capital allocation between the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin side. And when you get inside the Midland Basin with half our rigs, we'll probably maintain about the cadence that we've got or the location that we've got now with the 6 rigs we're running. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. And yeah, I guess as my follow up to \u2013 kind of relating to that, as you think about ramping to the higher rig count, I guess, kind of 17 to 20, I guess is kind of the indication there, how do you think about inventory depth in that framework? Like, how would you quantify how long you could run at that level? Travis D. Stice: Well, if you just look at what we did with this last acquisition, I've said, 1 to 1.5 rigs and that's going to give me with those locations that we called, that's super tier 100% rate of return. That gives me 7 to 10 years of drilling just on this newly-acquired acreage. So with the continued good results we're seeing in Pecos County, we listed several wells in our press release. The Reeves County stuff along the Reeves border, we're still early in the game there, but we've just got outstanding well results. So I think we've got a long runway of inventory even at a higher rig cadence. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay, got it. And then how quickly you think you could get to that rig cadence given the current strip? Michael L. Hollis: Right now it's a rig every five or six months, certainly when dips come in and we start getting another $10 or so of realizations, that will move down to the three or four month range. But we want to maintain our efficiencies and not try to grow too quickly. So somewhere in the three to six month range depending on realizations. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow up first on the infrastructure question on the acquired acreage, anything in mind from an oil gathering standpoint that I guess might be beneficial towards bringing the assets the same level of capital efficiency as the rest of your portfolio? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, their oil is already on pipe with \u2013 gathered by Reliance, and we're on the Reliance system up in that same area as well. So we won't call in any oil gathering on lease. That will come straight to the battery. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon : Got it. And then on the location count, appreciate the split by target horizon for the top quartile locations but just hoping to get a little more color at the county level as well. Of those top quartile locations are any of those in Dawson or is that potential upside versus what is written in for Martin, Andrews thus far? It looks like there's a little bit of Middle Spraberry potential in Dawson based on slide 12? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, there's a little Middle Spraberry potential, but it's certainly not in the top quartile inventory number, the 100% IRR number. Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon : All right. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler of Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Good morning. Wanted to just ask on the acquisition, it sounds like they're drilling with one rig and on some pretty significant pads. Will there be any more wells coming online there or should we kind of think about where that production should be around the timing of the actual closing of the acquisition? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, I would expect the production to bleed off a little bit into the close of the transaction. They just brought a full oil pad on that hasn't quite peaked yet, but it's getting close to its peak. And then \u2013 so at the time of close, it will probably be a little lower than the 12,000 boes a day today, and with a 12-well pad coming on sometime in Q2 of next year, the ramp will be significant. Jason Wangler : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles A. Meade: Thank you. Good morning, Travis, to you and your team there. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Charles. Charles A. Meade: I'm wondering if you could help us \u2013 I like these stoplight maps you put on slides 11, 12, 13. And I think the name helps with the interpretation. But I'm wondering if you could guide us a little bit more in what you're representing with these colors and how it interacts with the inventory. And my understanding is that the thermal maturity goes to a pretty rapid transition right around that Dawson Martin line. And is that really what we're seeing represented on this map? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, that's one of the parameters that our geoscience group uses when they put these stoplight maps together. I believe this is the first time that we've shared these stoplight maps with the market. But this is one of the things that we look at across the whole Permian Basin that our geoscience teams have put together that allows us to high grade our business development opportunities. Charles A. Meade: Got it. Thank you. And then talking about some of the recents, you mentioned that Ajax has kind of expanded the prospectivity in the Wolfcamp A and you mentioned in the slides that you could perhaps push that to the southwest for the Wolfcamp A. What do you need to see or what do you need to learn to expand that prospective zone in that direction? And is that the same sort of thing that you'd have to see or learn for the Wolfcamp B? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, it's just time. It's just going to take time. We've seen referencing the Wolfcamp B, there's been some really good results recently moving north from some private operators in the Wolfcamp B as well. So we kind of like to fast follow and certainly we anticipate the Wolfcamp A to continue to move. These stoplight maps change over time, and in this area, they've gotten better. Travis D. Stice: And Charles, if you look specifically to slide 13 on our slide deck, that's the Wolfcamp A well performance, and that's over 365 days where it's came over 350,000 barrels of oil only. So significantly above the type curve. And so those are the type of indicators that we look at to push development. And you can see even the second well that's been on for little over six months, there's also well-above the type curve. So we like to think very conservatively in terms of our type curves, but outperformance certainly drives future capital allocation. Charles A. Meade: Got it. That's helpful, Travis. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: You bet, Charles. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from the line of Juan Jarrah. Your line is now open. Juan Jarrah : Thanks, guys. Sorry about that. Just following up the Ajax acquisition, just curious as to the 12,000 barrels currently being produced; A, what formation is that primarily coming from? And B, can you quantify how many horizontals are currently producing? Just want to get a sense of the land versus the inventory versus the existing wells. Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I'd say of the 12,000, five or six wells, horizontal wells make up 33%, 35% of it. There's a lot of legacy horizontal wells drilled by an operator prior to Ajax that just aren't very good wells. There's also some vertical production on the acreage. So very early in its development, I'd say, it's the majority of the flush production is coming from multi-zone pads. They did a lot of \u2013 they did two or three well STACK pads in the A, MS and LS throughout the first part of this year. Juan Jarrah : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Adam Lawlis, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam T. Lawlis: Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's third quarter 2018 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's third quarter 2018 conference call. Diamondback was able to execute on multiple, long-term strategic initiative over the last three months, all while maintaining our focus on near-term execution with best-in-class operating efficiencies and margins. We grew production 9% quarter-over-quarter to a 123,000 BOEs a day while decreasing cash cost over the same time period. Our production is now up 45% year-over-year all from organic growth within cash flow, and our updated 2018 production guidance implies 50% year-over-year growth within cash flow. In a world where capital discipline is now the primary theme across North American energy and companies are discussing what they plan to do, look no further than what Diamondback has done over the past three years. Our operating philosophy has not changed. Maximized production growth within cash flow, maintain best-in-class operating metrics, low leverage, and execute on acquisitions accretive to our current acreage position and per share metrics. All of which, we continue to do in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we announced our transformational combination with Energen. As an update, we have received regulatory approval for the merger, and the shareholder meetings are scheduled for November 27 with the deal expected to close shortly thereafter pending shareholder approval. We are currently operating 14 rigs and Energen is currently operating 10 rigs, both split evenly between the Midland and Delaware Basins. We see this rig count as the baseline for our 2019 operating plan as we integrate the merger and work to instill best practices across the pro forma company's asset base. We will begin delivering on the primarily synergies presented in our merger presentation immediately, and our 2019 capital and production guidance will reflect this pro forma cost structure, which we will look to present in the coming months after the merger closes. We were also able to close multiple significant acquisitions in the Northern Midland Basin including the previously-announced Ajax acquisition and the recently-announced ExL acquisition. These acquisitions add 25,000 Tier 1 acres to our existing inventory and have three zones with greater than 100% IRRs at current commodity prices. The blocky complementary nature of these assets gives us significant running room for capital efficient, long-lateral development. Also because there are minimal drilling obligations across the block, we can run multiple rigs drilling large, multi-well pads and efficiently develop the reservoir. Diamondback will continue to look for assets complementary to our existing asset base that compete for capital right away within our existing portfolio at acquisition prices that allow us to generate full-cycle returns well in excess of our cost to capital. With the size and scale of our pro forma business, we will look to continue to grow production differentially within cash flow, add inventory and acreage without compromising our balance sheet, and grow a return of capital program through our dividend. With these comments now complete, I'll now turn the call over to Mike to discuss our operational highlights for the quarter. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you, Travis. In the third quarter, Diamondback continue to execute on both our near term and long-term crude marketing strategies. In the near term, we have over 100,000 barrels per day in gross production, lock-in firm transportation agreements with multiple third parties. These deals have been signed over the last six months and have various fixed differentials to Gulf Coast pricing, including deals linked to Brent and MEH. In general, pricing is expected to be the weakest in the fourth quarter this year and the first quarter of next year with pricing improving throughout the remainder of 2019. When the EPIC Pipeline project completes its early in service construction, Diamondback will benefit from space on that pipeline and overall lower differentials through the back half of 2019. With respect to our long-term oil marketing strategy, we now have over 200,000 barrels per day of space between the Gray Oak and EPIC Pipeline projects, with 50% of this space take-or-pay. We also have a 10% equity interest, our equity option in both projects held at our subsidiary, Rattler Midstream. This incentivizes Diamondback to efficiently utilize our long-haul space in both projects. We expect that Gray Oak project will move all of our anticipated production from Diamondback's current Delaware Basin position to the Gulf Coast, and that the EPIC project will move most of our anticipated production from our current Midland Basin position. We are proactively working with our marketers to secure a true wellhead to water solution with reserve, tankage and export capacity needed on the Gulf Coast. These deals remove the Midland market risk from our future while building our midstream business via strong strategic partnerships. In the third quarter, we also executed a joint development agreement with Carlyle for the development of the San Pedro area of our Pecos County asset and has started drilling with one rig. This strategic partnership will allow us to bring value forward from an area that does not currently compete for capital while also benefiting our midstream and minerals businesses. We look forward to a long successful partnership with Carlyle developing this acreage block over the coming years. In true Diamondback fashion, we've had an extremely busy and successful third quarter. I'd like to take this time to thank all of the Diamondback staff for leaning in together to make this happen. With everything we've accomplished this quarter, the team has never missed a beat on execution. Diamondback completed over 414,000 lateral feet this quarter across 43 wells with an average lateral length of over 9,600 feet. We operated 13 rigs and five frac crews throughout the quarter. We begin testing the use of 100% local sand in the Delaware Basin and we'll continue to monitor both our results and offset activity. In the Midland Basin, we are using local sand for all three of our completion crews and realizing roughly $60 per lateral foot of savings. We have also begun dual fuel operations on one drilling rig and one frac crew in the Delaware Basin, supplementing higher cost diesel with cheap natural gas. If the use of dual fuel continues to make economic sense, we have five drilling rigs and two completion crews with these capabilities currently in our fleet. Moving to well results, we are excited to announce two successful test of the Second Bone Spring in Pecos County, and look forward to continuing to prove-up this zone as a secondary target to the Wolfcamp A. We also announced that Wolfcamp A result on the eastern third of our Pecos County acreage that early-time is as good as any well we have completed across acreage block. Regarding our capital budget for the year, we are increasing our overall budget by 6% at the midpoint of our range due to an increase in our infrastructure and midstream budget for the year. This is primarily due to the continued build part of our midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, the added infrastructure from the execution of our joint development agreement with Carlyle, as well as our overall increased rig count exiting the year. Please note all of this investment has been done within cash flow. Over time, the infrastructure spend as a percentage of total capital in the Delaware Basin will begin to move from current levels to a rate that more closely represent what we achieved in the Midland Basin, roughly 10% of total capital. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Teresa L. Dick: Thank you, Mike. Diamondback's third quarter 2018 net income was $1.59 per diluted share, and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives and other items was $1.67 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $372 million and our cash operating cost were $8.70 per BOE including LOE of $4.34 per BOE and cash G&A of $0.78 per BOE. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $321 million on drilling, completion in non-operated properties and $74 million on infrastructure and midstream. Year-to-date, we have spent $934 million on drilling, completion in non-operated properties and $205 million on infrastructure and midstream, while generating free cash flow of $12 million excluding acquisitions. Diamondback ended the third quarter of 2018 with a net debt to Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times. After adjusting for the closing of the Ajax, ExL, and EnergyQuest acquisitions on October 31 and our increased credit facility of $2 billion, we ended the quarter with roughly $1.3 billion of liquidity. Finally, Diamondback's board of directors has declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of $0.125 per common share, payable on November 26, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2018. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question coming from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust, your line is open. Neal D. Dingmann: Good morning, all. Travis, my first question for you or Kaes or the guys. Can you discuss, it seems like a strategy that's really going to pay off longer-term. I want to dig a little bit more into your wellhead-to-water strategy, specifically. Could you talk about \u2013 I know there's a lot factors involved as far as the storage and everything with the ship channel, all the way to making sure you have the proper storage on the ship and everything itself. Again, just \u2013 I know, maybe a bit premature for that, but I'm just wondering if you could just give the highlight as far as what you all deem the benefits of a strategy like this versus what, sort of, I guess, options some others are taking at this point? Travis D. Stice: Sure. Well, the strategy that we've outlined a couple of times on our wellhead-to-water strategy is not one that sacrifices anything near term for long-term gains. I think we've really advantaged our investors with the way that we've set this structure up that allows us to ensure we've got firm transportation. We now have equity ownership in two pipelines that's going to fit within our Rattler Midstream, and really think that this strategy long-term is going to be seen as a really creative strategy that drives differential value to our shareholders. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. I mean, I think, long-term, Neal the upside for us is not one of our barrels on our current position will touch the Midland market for the foreseeable future. And if you think about the systems that we're going to be on and the long-haul systems we're going to be on, we're going to paying ourselves via our equity ownership to move our barrels to the water. So essentially we're getting to Corpus Christi almost for free. And then that's where the experts take over. We're not an exporter, we're not a marketer. And we have some strategic partnerships with exporters to handle those barrels from then on. In the near term, we used that scale and our commitments to those pipes to secure firm transportation in the near term in what is a pretty tight market in the Permian this year. So now we have over 100,000 barrels a day of gross production protected at fixed discounts to Brent and MEH to get us through the next couple quarters. And then once EPIC comes on in Q2 or Q3 next year, the dips start to ease and we'll start to maximize the benefits of these investments. Neal D. Dingmann: Okay. Great color. And then maybe just my second one for Mike. Mike, looking at that slide five, where you \u2013 I'm sorry, slide 14 actually, where you talk about the takeaway and sort of more about the landing zones that you're showing in the Southern Delaware. Could talk about \u2013 I think you mention in here about the high graded landing zones, but specifically if you could talk about the thickness when you look at the Bone Springs versus the Wolfcamp A, B and C? How important is it to have this sort of high graded landing zone in order to achieve sort of the highest results? Michael L. Hollis: Absolutely, Neal. 3D seismic, we've just got some high-resolution 3D data that's in and we're utilizing that for our targeting. And it's giving us the ability to stay well within that premium target in both the Wolfcamp A and the Bone Springs. Again, thickness is important, but where you are within that thickness and the rock quality is very important. So we continue to refine our model and continue to place these wells where we're able to test it and get that data so we can adjust as we go forward. But from the well results that we have been able to publish and show you guys, the work that we are doing down in Pecos County is really paying off. Neal D. Dingmann: Great. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. John Nelson : Good morning and congratulations on the update. Travis, our math says the market is only giving Diamondback credit for about $600 million of the more than $2 billion of synergies you all detailed alongside the Energen acquisition announcement. So I guess my question is; one, how, if at all, do you view the execution risk of Energen different from kind of the numerous other acquisitions the team's previously executed on? And then; two, can you maybe walk through a timeline for achieving some of the synergies that you outlined? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. We \u2013 I think we had in our prepared remarks, John. We anticipate when we update the market on our 2019 guide that the synergies that we outlined in our acquisition presentation, we're going to be \u2013 that's what to expect organizationally, that's the challenge that's been placed in front of us. And look, Every time Diamondback has made up pivot or done a large acquisition, there is always been in front of us a hurdle of execution. And our track record has always been to address that challenge and we overcome it every time while we've had flawless execution. This is a large acquisition, yes, but we are a larger company now as well too. So I feel really confident about the synergies that we outlined. It's $220 a foot in the Midland Basin wells. Obviously, the acquisition hasn't closed yet. But we're seeing things, I would say that the Energen organization exited really high as this merger goes through. And I couldn't be more excited about how the integration is going, the opportunity in front of the pro forma company to deliver on those primary synergies. And look, we also outlined a couple of billion dollars of second synergies as well too in that acquisition presentation. And I think those are going to become more and more real over time as we get some of these strategic initiatives executed upon. So I'm just really excited about what this pro forma company is going to be able to do in the upcoming quarters. John Nelson : That's great. And just to push a little bit, I think the timing on beginning to see the Midland Basin D&C and some of the G&A was 1Q in early 2019. Is that still kind of a fair target? Or as you kind of started to work on getting further along in evaluating or integrating with the team, is there any reason to believe that will be a little bit later to be achieved? Michael L. Hollis: No, John. We plan our 2019 guide, cost per lateral foot to be what we're doing today with 14 rigs across a 24-week program. And on the G&A side, we plan our $1 per BOE guidance to be in line with what we've done traditionally, which is less than $1 per barrel. John Nelson : Perfect. And then just the second question, the infrastructure spend is now kind of more than 20% at D&C capital and Mike you kind of hit on in your prepared remarks that should migrate to 10% over time. But as you think over the next one to two years, how should we think about that trajectory to get down to the long-term target. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, John, on slide 17, we put out a little comparison of the Midland and the Delaware Basins. We're five years into a horizontal program in Midland Basin, and now the infrastructure dollar as a percentage of total are much smaller amount, down to about 8% in total. The Delaware Basin when we bought that asset, really it was a new country out there in Pecos County and Reeves County and no infrastructure in place. So we've been spending a lot of money out there over the last two years. And you see that the Delaware is about 28% of total capital out there this year, but as our rig count ramps and the amount of batteries we have out there, the electricity is in place, the oil gathering system is in place, that number will decrease over time, and hopefully be less than 10% probably by 2020. John Nelson : Perfect. I'll let somebody else hop on. Congrats, again. Michael L. Hollis: Thanks, John. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all, and congrats on a strong quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Reading between the lines, you guys are truly excited about the Spanish Trail north asset, the potential of Middle Spraberry there. What level of activity should we assume for this area broadly as you look out to 2019 and 2020? Michael L. Hollis: Derek, we'd be looking at two to three rigs. We'll \u2013 the asset we had there before we were running between one, 1.5s then we added the additional 25,000 acres. It's reasonable to expect about one rigs per \u2013 about 10,000 acres. So you have somewhere in the three, four rigs running in the area going forward. Travis D. Stice: I think the other thing, Derek, that we tried to highlight in the prepared remarks was the fact that the lease obligations here are minimal, so we can actually take a rig and park a rig there and develop multi-well pads. I think we've talked previously about 12-well pad and that's what we intend to do is park a couple rigs there to develop in these eight to 12 well pads one right after another. And again that acreage has three zones that at today's prices has greater than 100% rate of return. So from a capital allocation perspective, those projects are going to compete in the top quartile of maybe not even the top 15%, top 10% of Diamondback's overall portfolio. So look to us to accelerate and lean in on one that as hard as we can. Derrick Whitfield : Great. Great update. And then regarding the second Bone Spring wells that you discussed in your press release, could you comment on the targeted zone within Bone Spring formation and your AFEs on those as wells? Michael L. Hollis: Derrick, yes. The AFEs are \u2013 again when we drill these wells, they are shallower, they are a little bit lower pressured than the Wolfcamp A. So we see somewhere in the 800,000 to 1 million difference. And again as we continue to use the local sand in the area, we'll be able to realize a little bit more of that savings. Again as far as the targeting, we do hit several targets in the Bone Spring, so we'll actually wine rack some in what we call an upper to lower. But again as we continue to develop this we have three wells in the area right now. So we don't have a whole lot of development to be able to talk about, but we wanted to delineate some acreage across the acreage bought. Derrick Whitfield : Great. Thanks. Very helpful guys. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Drew Venker : Good morning, everyone. How do you think about setting your capital program and the balance between growth and return of cash, and thinking also about just the free cash flow profile? Should we think about that as increasing over time, and then a corresponding slowing of the pace of regulations? Travis D. Stice: Yeah, I think we've been pretty clear what our strategy has been. We're going to allocate \u2013 we are going to continue to look at capital to high rate of return projects within cash flow and pay dividends. And the rig count right now is 14 from Diamondback and 10 from Energen. So that's going to be the initial allocation of capital. And we'll look \u2013 depending on commodity price and free cash flow, we'll look to \u2013 if we need to increase that in the back half of 2019. But, look, I think we are on the cusp really of having created what we feel like is a really special oil and gas company, because not only can we generate peer-leading growth, we can also grow our dividend and we can do bolt-on acquisitions all within cash flow and doing so with less than a turn to leverage. And we think that's pretty special and we think that's the strategy that's going to carry this company forward for multiple years if not decades to come. And we think that's what that journalist have been looking for, that's what the specialist in energy space have been looking for. And I think Diamondback has touched all of those levers as we've matured as a company. Drew Venker : Thanks for that Travis. And in terms of the Howard County lawsuit with Energen, is there anything you can really share there as far as timing and then how you guys would proceed with either acquiring the acreage in full or some other structure to move ahead with development there? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. We can't talk too much about it, but Energen did put out an 8-K about 10 days ago that the Court of Appeals had ruled in favor of Energen in that lawsuit. I think the counterparty has the opportunity to appeal that sometime over the next 30 days. So we're going to be waiting patiently and hope this deal comes to a resolution in some shape or fashion. Drew Venker : Thanks. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Michael Dugan Kelly : Hey, guys, good morning. Travis D. Stice: Good morning, Mike. Michael Dugan Kelly : Specific one for me. Just if I look at your updated production guidance for 2018, could you guys give a sense of how much of that roughly kind of 2,000 barrels a day increase is attributable to these acquisitions you're folding in here in Ajax and ExL. I was little unclear on that? Thanks. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Mike, this is Kaes. I'll take this a further step back. If you look at when we came into this year we guided midpoint of 112,000 a day production, the new midpoint of our guidance is 119,000 barrels a day production. And even if you take all the Ajax and ExL production together, let's just say, it's about 12,000 barrels a day today for two months of credit that would be 2,000 barrels a day production out of that 7,000 barrels a day we raised. So more specifically for the year, we're organically raising our production guidance by 5%. Going into the year we're going to grow 40% within cash flow we're now going to grow 50% within cash flow all due to the outperformance of well results. But more specifically to Q4, we raised our guidance last quarter for the Ajax acquisition by about 4% at the midpoint. We raised it again this quarter by 2%. I'd say, 25% of that 2% is attributable to ExL, which is about 500 barrels to 600 barrels a day out of the 2,000 barrel a day increase. Michael Dugan Kelly : Awesome. That's lot of detail. Appreciate that. Kaes Van' t Hof : So, I'd say, 30% related acquisitions for the year and 70% of the growth related to organic growth for the year. Michael Dugan Kelly : Okay, great. Appreciate that color. And then another one to be fairly granular here, on the differentials. You guys were little more than $13 off WTI in Q3 on oil front. I think Mike mentioned that, Q4, Q1 still has a Midland exposure, not going to be that pretty, but things start to change in 2Q with all these fixed term contracts and once you get oil in pipe. Would you care \u2013 could you maybe just frame it for us a little bit, how you expect to ultimately see those oil realizations trend maybe at the end of 2Q and the second half of the year, where you could be relative to WTI kind of incorporating everything you laid out to us? Thanks. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. I think Q4 will look better than Q3 because of the improvement in the Midland market. We had two deals that priced in the second quarter that were at fixed differentials to MEH over that quarter. And so, those deals are in place throughout first quarter next year and then through all of next year. And then, we have some other deals currently pricing that are looking better, because the Midland market has improved. So, overall, I think, Q4 differentials to WTI will look better than our Q3 differential, but tightening through Q2 of next year. And then when the EPIC pipe comes on early, we'll have space on that, and that kind of clears the basin until the other large pipes Cactus and Gray Oak come on. Michael Dugan Kelly : When that all is said and done, Kaes, I mean do you think that assuming \u2013 yeah, incorporating the fees you're going to have to pay to actually to get the crude to the Coast, do you have a sense \u2013 can you kind of frame it in terms of what you'd expect to be priced at relative to WTI incorporating transportation? Michael L. Hollis: I think I'll take it a different way in that we'll be at the Gulf Coast price less about $3 or $4 to get to Corpus Christi. And of that $3 or $4, we're going to pay ourselves probably 65% of that with our equity interest in the pipes and our ownership of in-basin gathering with Rattler. Michael Dugan Kelly : Got it. Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, two unrelated question. In the past, Travis, you've talked about grow and prune strategy. It looks like you've added some nice acreage. On pruning, what are the areas that are prime for high grading, and your thoughts or early thoughts on Central Basin Platform near term? Travis D. Stice: I think, Asit, if you look on any of our presentation, any slide in our presentation, it has those ellipses around the kind of what we're calling our core areas \u2013 core development areas. Anything outside those circles or ellipses are what we're considering as assets that are available for pruning. Now, the first thing we're going to do and we were clear with this during the acquisition of the \u2013 with the Energen presentation is that our first, is to try to swap and core that up. But to the extent we can't swap and core that up, it becomes divesture candidates. And look, Central Basin Platform, we've essentially called that reserve for sale and we'll start that process as quick as we can after the merger closes. Asit Sen : Great. Thanks. And then on the dual fuel opportunity, which switched to natural gas, looks like we were trying on one rig potential to go up to five rigs, early thoughts on the reliability issues and the potential savings that you expect? Michael L. Hollis: Absolutely. Reliability, the diesel engines, they have no issue running natural gas as part of the fuel stream. We can run upwards to 60% maybe as high as 70% of the fuel stream is natural gas as opposed to diesel. Savings wise on completion crews, again, it depends on the size of the job and whether it's Midland or Delaware, but in general, roughly about $100,000 a well or $10 a foot. On the drilling side, it's of course we use a lot of less diesel on the drilling side. So it's somewhere in the $15,000 to $20,000 a well range there. Asit Sen : Very helpful. Thanks, Mike. Michael L. Hollis: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Tim Rezvan with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Timothy Rezvan : Good morning, folks. I'm trying to get some context on the ExL tack-on you announced last night. You highlighted acreage and production. You also mentioned related assets. Can you talk about what those related assets are? Is it infrastructure or kind of minerals just trying to understand that value in relation to the total price. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah. Nothing major. It's just some infrastructure and batteries that came with the acquisition. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. So those will get folded into I guess into Rattler? Travis D. Stice: Correct. Michael L. Hollis: Yes. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. And then on the \u2013 if we just step back a little bit, Travis, you've been pretty clear about this growth within cash flow approach and you've sort of hinted at dividend growth moving forward, and talked about cash capital discipline. At the same time, there's been over $1 billion in acquisitions announced in the last three months separate from Energen. So how do you think about when or how Diamondback might sort of dial down the resource capture? And I guess do you that this acquisition appetite kind of muddies the picture for investors who are looking for clarity on capital discipline? Travis D. Stice: Well, I'll try to be clear that the acquisitions we do we would do so without putting the balance sheet at risk. And again, if you go back and look at our history, you've always seen, we have maintained a fortress balance sheet for just these type of opportunities. But look this \u2013 what we're calling now the Spanish Trail North, that was just too good of an opportunity not to have transacted on. We felt like we had differential knowledge in the area because of our legacy activity. We felt like we had willing sellers that they weren't marketing the process broadly. And we felt like we could bring our expertise to wells that could immediately compete for capital right way. Going forward, Jim, I said during the Energen merger presentation that Diamondback in a large sense is going to be on the sidelines on the acquisition front. And that's essentially where we are right now. We understand what our challenge is in front of us, and that challenge is very clearly defined as execution. So, throughout really now both organizations, we understand that the battle lines are drawn for us to execute on those synergies, which is why we spent so much time detailing the synergies and our plans for or the timeframe for when we're going to deliver on those. So, look, I think we've got a lot of things going, very positive direction for Diamondback. And I think we really like our inventory where it sits right now. And, like I said, we're more or less on the sidelines until we get this merger integrated and start delivering materially on the synergies that we talked about. Michael L. Hollis: And I'll add tuck-in acquisitions like the ExL acquisition that make a lot of sense are just going to be part of our core operating philosophy. And capital discipline probably has a couple of definitions in the market. To us, capital discipline is not out-spending our cash flow, do you see any CapEx plus infrastructure plus our dividend, which is small but continuing to grow, equals our operating cash flow. And that's our mantra of capital discipline. And we expect our investors to expect us to do deals that have created full cycle returns and compete for capital right away with our existing inventory. Travis D. Stice: Yes, these acquisition, Tim, are immediately accretive. And listen, you've covered us for a long time, Tim, and you know that the capital discipline mantra is not something new. As I've pointed out, we are 15 quarters in a row right now of being capital disciplined in terms of spending less than we make. And I think that's a unique commentary in the energy space right now. 15 quarters in a row, so essentially after the oil price collapsed in 4Q 2014, this capital discipline has been fundamental to our capital-allocation strategy. In not one single quarter have we deviated from that strategy. So I think any of our investors that have known Diamondback understand that capital discipline is believed because of not what we say but because of what we have done. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. I appreciate that context. And just sort of to close the loop, I guess if you're running models through 2020 and you have a decent commodity price. You can see pretty healthy free cash flow. So besides the dividend we should look to kind of you all sort of putting that to work on opportunistic resource capture is just kind of how you're thinking about that free cash flow? Travis D. Stice: That's one of the levers that we can crack on. Look, the returns of capital to our investors is a real strategy that we at the board have discussed. And that return of capital can take many forms. But it's real within Diamondback and its visible when you look at 2020 and beyond. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. Appreciate all the context, folks. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Hey, good morning, everyone. Appreciate the kind of update on the Energen plans and kind of the 2019. As you look at that 24 combined rigs, do you expect to kind of keep 14 on your properties and 10 on Energen to starter? How do you kind of think of the allocation of those rigs going forward? Travis D. Stice: These drilling schedules the way we like to think they are immediately flexible. In fact, they are really about six months to nine months out in front. So once the merger goes through, we're going to continue operating 14 Diamondback rigs on the Diamondback properties and the 10 on Energen properties. And it probably won't be until late 2Q or the back half of the year before we're able to start modifying the drill schedule substantially. Jason Wangler : Okay, that's helpful. And then, obviously, you talked a bunch about the infrastructure spend on your end and as you grab the Energen assets as well. Can you talk about kind of where they are in the stage of that lifecycle? Do you see a significant amount of spend that you would need for them as you look at 2019 and closing that deal? Or do you think it will be kind of comparable to what you look to spend on the Diamondback assets next year and going forward? Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, actually what's been exciting for us is to see how much they had in place. They've been really smart about how they've built their infrastructure especially in the Delaware Basin where they have probably twice or three times the SWD capacity that we have today. So they've have been operating in the Delaware for a long time and they've set up a great infrastructure system. So I'd expect their percentage of total capital to be closer to our Midland Basin percentage of total capital. The thing with us in the Delaware Basin, 100,000 acres with really nothing on it. So we had to put electricity, oil, gas, water, SWD all in over the last 24 months. And it's been benefiting as long-term with realizations and LOE and midstream value creation. But it's just a lot of money we're spending as a percentage of total in the Delaware at the moment. Jason Wangler : I appreciate. Thank you. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thank you. Good morning. Lot of my questions have been asked already, Travis. But just going back to the D&C cost for next year. I believe it was mentioned that intend to basically use current Diamondback D&C cost for the entire program next year. Are you seeing any meaningful cost pressures anywhere on the D&C side even if they are being offset by other efficiencies? Michael L. Hollis: Richard, this is Mike. The quick answer is yes. With oil price increasing, we obviously see service cost go along with that steel tariffs and all of those that are in place today. So, going forward, absolutely in our budget, we are taking into account some of the inflationary pressures. However, we also take into account the cost savings from local sands and put some of the pressure pumping deals that we have in place today as well as some of the operational efficiencies that we have our eyes set on today as well as what we get to working on those. So the answer is yes. We're going to take current pricing that we have today in our current structure, apply it as well to the Energen properties. But going forward, yes, there will be some inflationary pressures coming. Richard Merlin Tullis : Thanks, Mike. And then I just lost one. So looks like the industry take away bottlenecks are on track to get relieved in the second half of next year. Looking longer term, are you seeing any potential issues that could slow the strong industry growth projections over the next couple of years whether it's on the water side et cetera? Kaes Van' t Hof : Richard, we're doing everything we can to be ahead of all these issues. There's always going to be a new issue in the Permian. I think NGLs are getting solved, crude is getting solved. For us, it's the most important. And gas is getting solved by the end of 2019. So we've put a lot of water capacity into our systems in the Delaware Basin, and we're getting ahead of our growth ramps so that any issues that do present themselves we're looking to be ahead of. And I think you have a rule of thumb that we've got to stay two years ahead of major issues. Now, this oil gathering or oil take away issue crept-up on us faster than we expected, but we've now solved it. And I think all of our barrels and growth barrels projected are going to have a nice home on the water for a long time. Richard Merlin Tullis : All right, Kaes. Thank you. That's all for me. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Richard. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles A. Meade: Good morning, Travis, to you and your team there. I wanted to explore a little bit the \u2013 maybe \u2013 your future plans in that new Spanish Trail North area you're creating. You've done a good job of assembling that in seems like pretty quick fashion. But it strike to me as I look in the map, you've got perhaps chance to extend that towards the southeast and connect the dots with that energy position that's kind of there kind of Central or Northwest, Martin County. So can you help us calibrate our expectations on not just may be your appetite to do that, but also the possibility of are there other sellers in that spot? Travis D. Stice: Well, we think we've been pretty opportunistic in putting this position together. We've now got over 25,000 Tier 1 location that all set up for 10,000 plus laterals. And so, as Kaes highlighted earlier, we'll continue to be opportunistic to do bolt-on deals. And for a plus $20 billion market cap company on a pro forma basis, these tack-on deals can be relatively large from historical perspectives. But we couldn't be more excited about that Spanish Trail North area, and we're very pleased with what our position looks like right now. And we'll be opportunistic to do small tuck-ins and bolt-ons if they are accretive, and they make sense for our development scenario. Michael L. Hollis: And Charles as far as connecting the dots, whether it's with the acreage in between or whether we can you do it with our infrastructure, we'll take advantage of that anytime it make sense. So we'll tie-in things like oil gatherings, SWD capacity, and take care of that so we can increase our ability to move fluids from one place to another. We do that across all of our other acreage, and I think it would be reasonable to expect here that we'll do the same thing. Charles A. Meade: Right. It's one of those advantages of scale you guys have been talking about. If I could ask you for my second question, going back to your comments in the prepared remarks about those, I believe it was new let go wells in Pecos County on the Eastern third of your acreage. Can you talk about whether those wells have in any way changed your view of the surrounding area either by de risking some inventory, or perhaps alternatively high grading some of that inventory over there? Kaes Van' t Hof : Charles, it confirmed our initial assessment of the area. And so, no, it really hasn't changed any of our plans. At the end it's very productive in that area. It's to the eastern side. It also makes us excited about what may happen down and what we call our San Pedro area even further into the east and south of there. So again we're \u2013 it's exciting to see the productivity across the entire acreage block. Michael L. Hollis: Yeah, I think it's important to remember that we're very early in the Delaware Basin probably 80 wells into a 3,000-well program. So, our geos and reservoir engineers and ops team, they're all learning a ton as we start to ramp up there. We started with two rigs and now we're running seven rigs across the Delaware. So, certainly learning things every well we drill. Charles A. Meade: That's help color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Anthony Hall : Thanks, good morning. Just kind of curious on the \u2013 as you think about 2019 and the activity profile relative to the efficiencies we've seen of late. I think in the third quarter you completed something little over 400,000 lateral feet with the 13 rigs and five crews. Is it fair to just kind of scale up that kind of quarterly footage completed with the new equipment profile for 2019? Or do you think it will kind of take a dip down as you integrate the new assets and then kind of when would it normalize if that's the case? Kaes Van' t Hof : Michael, we expect \u2013 we think about it on a completed lateral feet per crew per day. On the Midland Basin side, our crews right now average about 1,400 lateral feet per day, that includes all move-time throughout the quarter. And on the Delaware side, we're closer to 900 lateral feet per crew per day. So, we're running five crews right now. Post-acquisition or merger completion, we'll probably run 10 crews. And those crews will be about evenly split between Midland and Delaware five and five. So, we expect those operational efficiencies to hit right away. Michael Anthony Hall : That's helpful. And then I guess on the wellhead to water strategy, what if any additional details can you provide on the water side of that equation? What exactly have you secured? What sort of contracts have you taken on and kind of where does that end I guess in the value chain as it relates to Diamondback? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, our expertise ends when the pipe ends, and then transfers over to the marketer's expertise. We're still planning to sell the barrel to the marketer at our wellhead in the Permian. And the marketer will then step into our tariffs and move our barrels to the Coast. And via our commitments to these pipes, they know what our minimum volume is going to be on these pipes and that allows them to secure the tankage and the export capacity that they need in this particular case in Corpus Christi. Michael Anthony Hall : Okay. No, that's helpful. I think that's all I have for now. I appreciate the time. Congrats, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Leo Mariani with NatAlliance Securities. Your line is now open. Leo P. Mariani: Hey, guys. Just a quick question for you here on well performance. Certainly, it seems like your wells got stronger this quarter from what you guys demonstrated. You guys did talk about having some better 3D of late out there in the field. Could you maybe just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of some of the improved well performance and some of the reasons behind that? Paul S. Molnar: Yes, this is Paul Molnar. We're obtaining \u2013 continuing to obtain 3D in the Southeast Delaware area. And it's really helping us with our geosteering. As you can see, there's a lot less vertical well control down there, and prior operators had difficulty staying in their targeted intervals. And as the 3D is coming in, we're having a lot more success staying in our primary targets. Travis D. Stice: And Leo from the other side of the operational piece, of course, we're learning, continuing to optimize every day. So, we've changed from the landing points to how we stimulate the wells, how we flow the wells back, whether it's cluster spacing in size, fluid volumes, sand content, distribution of the sand size, the intensity with which we frac with, whether we use diversion, and the answer is we use all of those, and we continue to change that recipe over time and we'll continue to get better as we go. And you've seen that across the industry as a whole. But all of those with being able to put the wells in the right spot in the rock and spaced properly is I think what's given in all of those things together are what you are seeing with the better well performance. Leo P. Mariani: Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, I certainly noticed that just looking at your guidance for oil cut for 2018, I guess you guys reduced it a little bit here with this update and I guess it's kind of been coming down a little bit in the last couple of quarters in terms of your oil cut. Just wanted to get a sense of what was driving that. I don't know if you guys were shifting activity to different areas, but maybe just a little color behind that. Michael L. Hollis: Yes, Leo, it's been interesting to see not only ourselves but also across the Permian with natural gas takeaway getting tighter and economics prevailing. Ethane has been moving out of the residue stream and into the NGL stream. And therefore, increasing our NGLs as a percentage of total. So, six to one molecule is getting more one to one credit as an NGL. So really NGLs have grown \u2013 out-grown our oil cut or oil growth, so that led us to lower the oil cut for the year. Really think the kind of midpoint of our new range is where we are for the foreseeable future until something changes on the ethane front. Leo P. Mariani: Okay. So just with respect to what you just said there on ethane, I mean, do you guys have expectations that there'll continue to be a lot of ethane pulled out of the stream for the foreseeable future, next several quarters? I mean, how do you see that playing out as we work into 2019? Michael L. Hollis: Yes, I mean, it's a push forward, the tightness in both NGL market and the natural gas takeaway market. But the ethane pricing right now seems to be \u2013 ethane acceptance versus rejection is the norm in the Basin. Leo P. Mariani: Thanks, guys. Michael L. Hollis: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Travis Stice, our CEO for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Tuwanda [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2018 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; and Tracy Dick, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found on the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's fourth quarter 2018 conference call. 2018 was another transformational year for Diamondback. We successfully closed three large acquisitions in the fourth quarter, including our acquisition of Energen, which combined nearly doubled our core acreage position. Diamondback now has over 364,000 net acres in the core of the Midland and Delaware Basin along with another 96,000 net acres of Permian Assets, the majority of which are on the Central Basin platform which we are working to the best as part of our growing Permian Strategy. Diamondback grew production 53% year-over-year without giving the effect to the Energen merger, and exited the year producing over 250,000 BOEs per day in December after closing the merger. Our reserves are up almost 200% year-over-year to just shy of 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our organic reserve replacement ratio for 2019 was over 450%. Drill bit F&D was essentially flat year-over-year at $7.28 a barrel improved developed F&D was $10.44, highlighting the combination of our acreage quality and capital efficient cost structure. Commodity prices declined dramatically in the fourth quarter and as a result of this volatility Diamondback outspent the cash flow for the quarter. This was against our core operating philosophy and we reacted as quickly as possible after closing the merger by announcing a reduction in activity for 2019 and subsequently dropped three operating drilling rigs and two completion crews over the course of the last two months. Moving to 2019, we trimmed our capital budget versus previously described expectations in December and we still expect to grow production 27% year-over-year while also paying that 50% larger dividend than we did in 2018, all within operating cash flow. As Michael explained in detail later on in his call, we are realizing more synergies faster than expected after closing the Energen merger, all of which are reflected in our capital budget and projected operating costs in 2019. Lastly, we are actively working on dropping down the remaining mineral and royalty assets held at the Diamondback level to Viper and expect to do so at some point in 2019. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hollis : Thank you, Travis. Turning to Slide 8 through 10, we give an early time update on both the primary and secondary synergies presented when we announced our merger with Energen last August. The highest value primary synergy presented during the merger announcement was a reduction to Midland Basin well cost. Based on the midpoint of our 2019 cost per completed lateral foot guidance for the Midland Basin of $785, Diamondback expects to save $215 per foot versus Energen\u2019s second quarter 2018 actual cost, or over 95% of what we expected to achieve per foot by early 2020 in the merger presentation. This savings is not only attributed to the immediate implementation of Diamondback best practices on Energen acreage, but also due to some efficiencies the Diamondback team has learned, and implemented from Legacy Energen best practices. Also the benefit of size, scale and buying power on service cost have been greater than originally anticipated. Running these savings through 40% of our Midland Basin well count for the year, results in almost $150 million in capital savings. In the Delaware Basin, we are seeing enough improvements to move what was originally a secondary synergy into the primary synergy bucket. In 2019, we expect to save between $55 $60 for completed lateral foot, versus actual Energen well cost, most primarily due to multi well pads, longer laterals, completion and casing designs, as well as the cost benefit realized associated with larger scale. Overall, we expect Delaware Basin well cost to decrease by almost 7% versus 2018. Again, due to improved efficiencies, completion design and service calls concessions. As also seen on page 8, Diamondback has realized all of the expected $30 million to $40 million of G&A synergies earlier than anticipated, which are fully reflected in our 2019 guidance. Looking ahead, we have line of sight of even more combined, capital, operating, midstream and mineral synergies and we look forward to updating the synergy scorecard with these initiatives in progress. With these comments now complete, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Tracy Dick : Thank you, Mike. Diamondback\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 net income was $2.50 per diluted share and our net income adjusted for non-cash derivatives, and other items was $1.21 per diluted share. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $468 million and our cash operating costs were $8.10 per BOE, including LOE of $4.51 and cash G&A of $0.67 per BOE. During the quarter, Diamondback spent $424 on drilling completion and non-operated property and $101 million on infrastructure and midstream. For the year ended 2018, we spent $1.4 billion on drilling completion and non-operated properties and $306 million on infrastructure in midstream. Diamondback ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with $192 million in standalone cash, and approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, resulting in 700 million of liquidity. Finally, Diamondback\u2019s Board of Directors had declared a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of $0.125 per common share payable on February 28, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21st 2019. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Nelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. John Nelson : Good morning and congratulations to the team on the velocity of synergy capture. Quite impressive. Travis Stice : Thank you, John. John Nelson : Starting, maybe Travis, with your view on share repurchases in the capital pecking order and in particular your share count is up about 70%. Your stock is down about 20% in the last year. So with that in mind just curious how the company thinks about share repurchases, both with potential monetization proceeds as well as 20 :20 free cash flow. Travis Stice : Yes certainly John it's key to get to that point first, before we have meaningful conversations with Wall Street, exactly on what we're going to do. But I think, what we've signaled in the past is that shareholder friendly initiatives such as share repurchases, continued focus on increasing the dividend, all of those things are within our bandwidth of what we can do in the form of returning cash to our investors. And as we progress through 2019, and start seeing the focus on 2020, and in the significant free cash flow generation that's going to occur then, I think that's a more appropriate time. But, we've committed to continue to grow the dividend, and continue to focus on the shareholder friendly initiatives. John Nelson : Fair enough. And then second question I think the original guidance targeted something around $50 WTI to be kind of cash flow neutral. We're a bit above that on kind of strip today. I guess philosophically, the company going to continue to target a $50 type commodity price or would you all average potentially if oil prices remain a bit stronger? Travis Stice : No, I think at this point, John we know we've got a pretty good long term strategy laid out at $50 a barrel and I think as commodity price improves back half of this year maybe into 2020 you could look at -- look at us to perhaps add one to two rigs in 2020 and beyond with this significant free cash flow I was talking about. But I think, the point that we made in our December call, which represented a strategic pivot for Diamondback specifically, addressed the waiver free cash flow that's coming, that the pivot is that we're not going to redeploy that all back into the ground. We're going to start returning that -- start returning that to our shareholders. And we began that again this year by increasing our dividend as well. So that's the pivot that we've that -- we've made and we're and we're committed to continue to look at that even as commodity prices improve. John Nelson : Thanks. Congrats again on the quarter. Travis Stice : Great. Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is open. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks. Good morning all, and congrats on a strong quarter and outlook. Travis Stice : Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for Travis, with regard to your secondary and other synergies, would it be fair to think that those synergies could exceed 2 million in aggregate? Travis Stice : We put a scorecard together, and it's what we call our synergy scorecard. It's on Slide 8 of our investor deck, and we're going to continue to lean into delivering all the synergies that we described in the acquisition call there in August. And look, I'm optimistic that we can continue to improve on all of these metrics. We've talked about in my prepared comments, that we're working on a dropdown from the back to Viper and the midstream assets are all rolled in. So these are all those secondary synergies that we've already got tremendous traction behind delivering on those in 2019. But we're going to -- we're going to continue to update the market on this synergy scorecard and as these things materialize we'll look forward to telling a really good story around these additional synergies above and beyond what we talked about in August. Michael Hollis : Yes, I think what's important Derrick is that we base the trade on the merger with Energen on the cost synergies and the execution side of the business. And the other synergies mentioned, minerals and midstream are really more on the financial side. So we predicated the deal on the execution and operation side and that\u2019s where we\u2019re most focused on today. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And then, shifting over to the Delaware regarding the Bone Spring shale well that you guys announced in Pecos, that's a particularly strong well given the decline attributes of that interval. How does that result change your view on capital allocation to the area if at all? Travis Stice : Well, we're certainly excited about that and the reason we\u2019re excited is that's a zone or a couple zones we didn't inscribe any value to the original Delaware acquisition. So, we\u2019re excited that we\u2019re seeing really good positive results. And we\u2019re going to be cautious, I mean, as we further define that zone, but I think we probably got a half a dozen or so on the drill schedule this year and we\u2019ll monitor results. And just like we always do we\u2019ll react quickly if we get greater returns of those zones, we\u2019ll allocate more dollars to the highest rate of return stuff. So, it's good news all around. It\u2019s good news because it's unrecognized upside that we\u2019re now bringing to the table and it's a good news for our inventory count in Pecos County. Derrick Whitfield : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and a very strong update. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, all. Travis, I mean, my first question is around the infrastructure spend. Could you talk a bit just in the sort of guide you have for this year. I know you had a bit of a -- I think for -- in last year bit of a higher infrastructure spend. And how you see that trendy now on the FANG corporate-wide going forward? Travis Stice : Yes, Neal, I\u2019ll take this one. Our infra spend and midstream spend is going to be $400 million to $450 million for 2019. Infrastructure is a bit higher on the battery side. If we are doing bigger pads and we\u2019re drilling in areas that have no existing wells. I mean, that was a one of the primary reasons we did the Energen trade, was how much completely undeveloped acreage they had and results in us meaning to build a lot more batteries than expected. The midstream budget should decline over time and hopefully that\u2019s in a separate business going forward. But overall probably 60%, 65% first half waited on the total infrastructure and midstream spend and then 40% in the back half for the year. Neal Dingmann : Great deals. And then, Travis, just overall question, you mentioned in the press release about obviously refraining from outspending cash flow enough to be one of the first two to adjust the plan. I guess, when you look at this plan, I mean, how do you sort of balance? I definitely appreciate that. But how do you balance that with more just sort of the continuity or stability of your plan versus changing that rig count or that activity more frequent to keep balancing that? Travis Stice : Well, we\u2019ve got to make sure we don\u2019t interrupt the efficiency of the Diamondback machine. That's one thing that the Diamondback is really known for, is our really outstanding execution. And so we can\u2019t disrupt the machine. But by that same token, Neal, we can\u2019t outspend cash flow either. We\u2019ve not done that for four years, but we had an aberration in the fourth quarter last year. We\u2019re \u2013 it just part of how we run business. And we would've actually dropped activity quicker in the fourth quarter last year, but we were on multiwell pads and that makes no sense at all to stop \u2013 finish \u2013 to stop completion on a mid -- run on a mid multiwell pads. So, we take that into account and you typically don't see that from the outside looking in. But we\u2019re committed to the capital discipline. This is a mantra that we been demonstrating since the OPEC announcement in the fall of 2014 and the subsequent price collapse. That's Diamondback, that's what we are known for. Neal Dingmann : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. Just looking at LOE and kind of your thoughts on how that will trend around 2019? And then outside of the potential sale of the Central Basin Platform. Are there other things that you are working on to further improve LOE in the future kind of next 24 aspect? Travis Stice : Yes. Gail, I\u2019ll let Mike answer that question, but you\u2019ve heard me say before until someone actually play this to produce these barrels we\u2019re going to always lean into our LOE and try to make that lower tomorrow versus what it is today. So, I'll let Mike to give you the real answer to that. But we always focus on LOE. Michael Hollis : Absolutely, Gail. Again, we are attack it on two fronts, again volume, increasing health as well. But a lot of it's on the dollars that we spend. So again bringing Energen and Diamondback together, we've done a really good job of grabbing synergies and finding ways to do things better, so there's areas and things that we've learned from the Energen folks, that we're implementing today, as well as the other way around. So, what we hope to see is a lower gross dollar amount spend as well as a growing production volume. So, to kind of give you an idea the Central Basin Platform accounts for about $0.50 of our LOE today. So again assuming a sale of the Central Basin Platform that would come off of our guide. But on a go-forward basis again, it's going to be a nice slow drop in LOE, assuming we can implement all of the initiatives that we're working on today. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then just looking at the potential drop down into Viper, when you look at Diamondback's ownership in Viper, is there a appropriate level that you guys want to maintain on a go-forward basis? Travis Stice : Yes, Gail. I think it's fair to assume that Diamondback owning 59% of Viper, we certainly enjoy owning as much of that business as possible. And if the parent company is generating free cash flow, I don't see a need for the parent company to take back cash in any transaction there. So, certainly I think Diamondback is looking to increase its ownership and Viper post the drop down. Gail Nicholson : Great. And just one last one, several quarters ago you guys brought up the Limelight prospect and doing some appraisal activity in 2019 . I'm just kind of curious how that fits into the portfolio today? Travis Stice : Yes. We're probably going to test it sometime in the middle of this year. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thanks, guys. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning. So I've two questions, one on synergy. Mike, I think you mentioned about increased buying power and just wondering now that you're more scale could you talk about specific incremental efforts on the supply chain, rebidding contracts etcetera? And then, how you are thinking differently about the mix of long-term and short-term contracts? That's from my first question. Michael Hollis : Absolutely. So, again, when we looked at the two entities apart, we went through and we didn't use all of the same services and vendors as well. So we went through and grabbed whichever ones appeared to have the better quality, service and price and we initially did that day one and swapped out some services on both the Diamondback and Energen side. Again with the size and scale, we have seen a larger change in price associated with the decrease in commodity prices that we've seen, so we've gone back in actually bidding a larger package, we've seen an increase in that, that change in what we are getting charged. Again, it's a hard number to tie down, so we've gone back to the vendors and business partners and asked if you were just Diamondback stand-alone what is that difference. And it looks like it's roughly -- of the change, roughly 20% of that change is what we're seeing for size and scale. Now, as far as how long we plan on tying up services, again, right now, we keep just like we do on any other thing we hedge, we keep a hedge book of what we have long-term contracts with and what we have more of a well-to-well. But in general, we're looking at six months to a year on most things. Asit Sen : Okay. Thanks. And, Travis, as a big picture question, as the industry moves more toward manufacturing style, where do you see use of technology and what are you most excited about? In last quarter, you talked about dual fuel operation in one of the rigs in Delaware, could you perhaps update us on the economic benefits you're seeing so far in plans going forward? Travis Stice : Yes. I'll let Mike talk specifically about our dual fuel operations, but listen, technology in our industry in particular any manufacturing business can have a chance to make a huge impact to the efficiency of the operations and we think that that's going to happen inside our industry as more and more advanced technologies come to bear. And those things are whether it's the way that we transport fluids, the transport media, the actual proppants, the technology which we steer these wells in zone, the real-time feedback and all the way up to artificial intelligence, these are all things that we believe are going to make a large change in the efficiency of the manufacturing process called producing and drilling for barrels out here in the Permian. I'll let Mike answer the dual fuel question. Michael Hollis : So Asit, the dual fuel we are currently running two frac fleet. So dual fuel, we have I believe five rigs currently running dual fuel. So again, where it makes sense, where we have the availability and the equipment already converted, we're making those moves any where it makes sense to do it today. On the implementation of new technology, of course, we use real-time data analytics on the drilling side, the completion side, basically all of the things Travis mentioned a second ago, the answer is yes on all of those from how we're doing our processing of our seismic data to how we steer complete and land these wells. So, the answer is yes, we're seeing a faster change of progress today than we've had in the last decade or two, which is what you would expect. But we see great things coming, we're not going to guide to any of those changes because we don't have them here today, but we're very hopeful for what's coming. Asit Sen : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks, Asit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Your line is open. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. Maybe a high-level question, I mean, you've -- over the last couple of quarters you talked that you've got -- you've shifted your focus somewhat toward greater free cash flow generation. How do you think about a target for -- longer-term targets for free cash flow generation at this point? Is it reasonable for you to move toward the free cash flow yield that's competitive with the broader market? And how do you think about the timing of how that plays out whether you make a conscious effort toward it or whether it just happens organically within the portfolio? Michael Hollis : It's really both I mean it's going to happen. We've made a conscious effort to do so and that's why we pared back activity to increase our cash flow, but it's also going to be happening organically, as we continue to look into the future. I mean, as I mentioned in some earlier comments 2020 and beyond we probably will add one to two rigs, but we\u2019ll still be in the process of generating significant free cash flow and that's what really has us excited about this new company that we've combined with Energen as -- just really that significant free cash flow generation that starts in 2020 and beyond? Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, historically you've been a material consolidator in the basin and a very successful consolidator. I mean, how would you characterize and I know you just closed the deal, but M&A appetite and the M&A environment at this point. And previously, you had commented how to use the free cash would allow you to potentially use some of that cash to fund more cash-driven deals as opposed to stock-driven deals, is that still part of the strategy -- is it less part of the strategy than it was previously? Any comments overall on that would be great? Travis Stice : Yes. So specifically to Diamondback what we're focused on right now is we continue to do small bolt-on trades to make sure we can operate these units and drill longer laterals and operating them with greater efficiency and so we're continuing to do that. The other really business development focus that we're really digging into right now is continued focus on doing swaps and trades with some of the scattered acreage that we acquired to the Energen assets. And so that's what our land teams particularly, our little business development organization is right now doing that trade. From a macro sense, it's obviously been real -- we think it's been real quiet on the M&A front. And I think there's a reason for that, that is it, all operators are trying to respond to living within cash flow and the days of buy an undeveloped acreage with one or two wells on it, in terms of not being able to be accretive on a cash flow perspective, those days are behind us. So Diamondback, we always have an obligation to our shareholders to try to look for -- to look for deals that can rate unreasonable value, but the bottom line is right now we don't see lot of those -- any of those deals out there. And we're focused on doing the small bolt-ons and the trades. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Travis. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Rezvan : Hi. Good morning, folks. First question I had is on realizations on slide 13 of your deck. You gave some kind of guidance quarter-by-quarter through 2019. I was wondering, if you could talk about the assumptions I guess, in the first and second quarter of 2019 because you appear to have more Midland exposure in the second quarter of 2019, but you're guiding to tighter differentials. So maybe just kind of broadly talk about sort of what assumptions you have that are underlying this guidance? Michael Hollis : Yes, Tim. So the assumptions are the market prices on a core basis as of last Friday, so you can use the strip as of a couple days ago and use that as your assumption for price. Now the Midland differentials coming significantly in the past couple of months and it's projected to stay pretty narrow. So, a couple of our deals roll off at the end of the first quarter. One of our deals goes down in differential at the end of the first quarter. So we -- once we realized how large playing [Indiscernible] expansion was and got window of what enterprise is looking to do on the NGL side conversion. We stopped signing any fixed differential deals. So leaving that exposure to the Midland market, we're happy for the majority of our barrels to be exposed to that Midland market as we've kind of gone through the takeaway crisis that was expected in 2018 and 2019. Tim Rezvan : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. My next question I guess is for Travis, if you could put sort of Director hat on now. Diamondback has always had one of the more honest and transparent discretionary comp kind of formulas in the industry. As the Company has matured and as you talk now about return on capital employed and free cash flow generation, can you talk about how kind of if at all the Board is thinking about appropriate discretionary comp metrics for senior management? Just trying to understand kind of where -- what the priorities are over the medium-term future? Travis Stice : Tim, I appreciate your comment on transparency. We've built Diamondback around three kind of core tenants, best-in-class execution, low cost operations and transparency, and that's been part of us since the very beginning. So I appreciate your transparency comments. Really, I think, Tim, what we did in 2015, I think we were one of the first companies to do so, the comp and it's not just executive comp, because we apply that same metrics to everyone in the organization, but we changed the comp focus away from growth in volumes and reserves. In fact, we removed those entirely from our scorecard and instead replaced them with efficiency measures. And those efficiency measures are proxies for returns, return on capital employed or other returns measures. So, that has continued going forward in the future. And while we've not set the focus for -- we've not set the scorecard yet for 2019, I anticipate the Board to again come back to the things that we think are important, which is generating high returns to our investors and keeping our operating metrics pristine and our execution still best in class. And so that's the way we -- that's the way we've gone -- I anticipate the Board to continue to go in 2019. It's -- I think it served us well over the last several years. Tim Rezvan : Okay. And just to -- little more clarity, you talk about high -- good returns for investors. Can you talk about what you mean, is that return on capital employed? Is that cash margin? Is that all of those things? Travis Stice : Well, the efficiency measures that we put in 2015 were -- we use them for proxies as the numerator and the denominator for return on capital employed. And we did so, so that we could build a track record of being able to see what our return measures look like. I think in most all of our investor presentations for the last several quarters for sure, if not longer than that, we've included return on capital employed measure. So again, we haven't decided what 2019 is going to look like, but it's certainly going to be returns focused for -- toward our investors. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Thanks for the comments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Mike Kelly : Hi, guys. Good morning. Travis, I was hoping you could potentially frame or just give a little bit more color on the mineral dropdown opportunity. I guess I'm really just trying to get a sense of how impactful this could be for you guys? Thanks. Michael Hollis : Yes, Mike. I mean there is a significant amount of minerals still held at the Diamondback level prior to the Energen deal. It's probably about 2,000 net acres that Diamondback just owns still at the parent level. The Energen deal adds another $60 million to $80 million or so of cash flow. So we're trying to right size that deal. I think it's going to be very sizable trade, meaningful to both Viper and Diamondback and near billion dollar type trade. Mike Kelly : Okay. I appreciate that. And kind of following on to Gail's question on this. It sounds like you would -- the mechanics of that deal would be more of you'd take Viper shares -- more weighted to Viper share versus cash. Am I thinking about that correctly or how should I think about that? Travis Stice : Yes. We've really -- those -- we've got -- we had some Board conversations on exactly how we're going to realize that value, but that's probably a good assumption at this point. Mike Kelly : Okay. Great. And then shifting gears to the Northern Delaware, the results there look pretty awesome. And just curious what the game plan looks like for the Northern Delaware in 2019. Maybe we could just talk about expected activity levels, wells put on line, et cetera. Travis Stice : Yes. That's one of the things I'm really excited about in this quarter's release, and it's probably well results are not the focus I understand that in anybody's quarterly release, but those four wells that we delivered in [Indiscernible] area, which is quite honestly now the best stuff in Diamondback's portfolio, and we acquired after managing those four wells. I think there were over 400 barrels oil per foot. Those are some of the -- those are the best wells we've ever drilled. So, obviously those -- that area is going to get as much capital allocation as we can put in there as quickly as we can. Mike Kelly : Got it. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that. Are you comfortable giving kind of a ballpark number how much acreage you have exposed around there? Michael Hollis : I'll just kind of talk rig count, we're going to run probably four or five rigs in that area. It's probably 50,000 or 60,000 total acres in the quarter there. Mike Kelly : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew Venker : Hi, everyone. I wanted to follow up on to that free cash flow comments you guys had made, and appreciate maybe it's too early to talk about specifically how you'll be returning cash, but maybe you can talk about your targets for leverage and if you're still hoping to strengthen the balance sheet further and how your Viper stake plays and how you think about that leverage? Travis Stice : Drew, I think one-time proceeds, asset sales, proceeds from minerals or our midstream business go toward debt reduction at the parent company, any return to shareholders whether that's a buyback or the dividend should come from true free cash flow in our opinion. We still want to maintain below two times leverage at the parent company on a consolidated basis, but we also don't want to lever up any of our subs about 2 times either. Drew Venker : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Grampp : Good morning, guys. I noticed you guys had a nice upward provision on the drilling inventory number. It looks like you're pushing almost 30 years now inventory. So, just wondering, do you feel that's a good level for inventory or maybe you guys can look opportunistically to monetize some of that tailwind or just high level thoughts on how the right level of inventory for you guys? Travis Stice : Yes, Jeff. We've been very clear on the grow and prune strategy that the Central Basin Platform is certainly up for sale and that process is ongoing. At this point, with the remaining inventory certainly we would look to dispose of some inventory at the back end of our 30 years of drilling inventory, but we're not actively working on any of that today given the commodity price environment. Jeff Grampp : All right, great. Great, I appreciate that. And then just on the well cost side, a little bit curious how you guys kind of envision 2019 playing out, and then kind of looking maybe into some -- an early sneak peek at what 2020 -- how that flows through to 2020? So can you guys talk maybe a little bit how do current well costs compare to the guidance that you guys put out and maybe how the things look like at year end, just relative to what's kind of baked into the guidance numbers that you guys have? Michael Hollis : Jeff, the current costs that we're seeing today is pretty well baked into our guidance. Now, going forward, it's all going to be depending upon typically what activity in oil price does. But what we're seeing right now is we're having much better conversations with folks today. So, we assume some softening will happen over the next couple -- or the next quarter, at least. Again, it's going to depend on what happens in the second half of the year. But for right now, we're planning for basically service cost and well cost to stay flat. A lot of the synergies and initiatives we're working on today will have some timed-out event. What we've talked about is what we have today, but we have some other initiatives that we're working on that should come to fruition throughout the year. So we see well cost coming down very slightly throughout the year unless there's some other change in activity level. Jeff Grampp : All right. Really helpful, Mike. And just if I can sneak an housekeeping one, can you guys disclose kind of ballpark what the platform assets are producing today? Michael Hollis : 7,000 to 8,000 barrels a day. Jeff Grampp : All right. Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time, guys. Michael Hollis : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jason Wangler : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just had one obviously, a lot on the call already, but just curious on the hedging side. Obviously, the debt is a little bit higher now, but you'll be working some of that opportunities like as the year goes on. Where do you guys get comfortable on the overall hedges? The basis is kind of covered, but just where should we be thinking about the hedge profile as the bigger company now moves forward? Travis Stice : Yes, Jason. I think our strategy has changed a bit as we become a big -- become a bigger company. In the past, it was let's protect the minimum capital required to hold our acreage position together and now it's kind of shifting toward -- we did disclose this number of 14 rigs to maintain exit-to-exit production, which is about $1.5 billion $1.6 billion of total capital. I think on a go-forward basis, we are going to look to hedge probably that maintenance capital, and then everything above that is exposure to the investors for both growth and oil price. Jason Wangler : I appreciate that. I'll turn it back. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, you and your team there. Travis Stice : Hi, Charles. Charles Meade : I wanted you to look at Slide 14 and actually kind of more of a big picture question particularly about your inventory versus your peers. So, you guys have [Indiscernible] lower inventory per foot, but I can imagine that converging one or two ways with the industry down to you or you increasing your location up -- count up to be more even with the industry. I have a guess, which way that that's likely converge with, I'm curious, what would your guess would be? Travis Stice : Charles, the way that we've always managed reserves, location count, production guidance is that we want to be conservative in the way that we communicate, because a lot of things happened in our industry and typically they'll always take things away. So in our experience, particularly as it pertains to inventory well, inventory count, it's a lot easier to add locations as well results and technology allows those locations to be there than it is to start taking them away. And as you've seen the reserve numbers start coming out this year, I think that's one of the first indications is a negative performance revisions in our industry. And most of those negative performance revisions are going to be attributed to wells being drilled too tightly and reserve auditors taking -- walking those locations back. So, we are very comfortable that we have sort of an at least view of what our inventory looks like an earlier on the call someone actually calculated a 30-year worth inventory. So, we don't feel a compelling need to start adding a bunch of locations just in the form of sticks on a map. So, we're comfortable where we are right now and we'll add as technology and well results dictate. Charles Meade : Got it. And then to push a little further on this Travis, if the industry in general \u2013 just generally speaking, not the case for you guys, but did get a little to close and they are backing up and going more like spacing, more like yours. It seems to me that, that would lead to probably better individual well results and more productivity in the near term, but in the mid-to-longer term, it would mean there's less quality inventory that then was thought maybe six or nine to 12 months ago. Does that -- do you see it that same way or is that not some you\u2026 Travis Stice : That's right. That's the way I think about it Charles, absolutely. Charles Meade : Got it. Got it. And then if I could just sneak in one more, you talked a lot about grow and prune strategy and that makes sense. I'm curious, you've got some kind of far-flung assets whether it be kind of in Southern Upton or Regan or Lee, are those kind of active interests that you're trying to trade now or is the trade activity more in the middle of the development fairways that you're seeing? Travis Stice : It's a combination, Charles, we probably have eight or nine active trades right now ranging from 160 [ph] acres swap to 1,000 plus acres swap. So, all options are on the table, the real prune is the Central Basin Platform, but as we talked about Page 14, as long as we can keep working on that average lateral lengths going up with us drilling, 9,400 average lateral feet per well this year to get that inventory number up, our land and BD teams, we've successfully executed on our grow and prune strategy. Charles Meade : Got it, thanks for that detail, guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. Wondered if you could give a little bit more color around those four, I guess stellar wells that you guys recently drilled, I guess and completed there on the Energen acreage. I guess, for those prior wells done by the Energen team with sort of their own drilling and completion methods or whether these done by FANG with the your techniques? Travis Stice : Leo, yes, the wells were already drilled by Energen. And again the great thing about the combination is that we had very similar philosophies and where we -- for the land and drill the wells so, they landed in very similar spots to where we would have chose as well, but the actual completion happened right at in a little after the close. So again, we had already merged some of the operation groups by that time, but now again a collaborative effort. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. As I was just trying to get a sense of whether or not you guys are maybe doing things a bit different on the completion side and what Energen was doing, you clearly laid out some material cost reductions versus Energen. Just trying to get a sense of whether or not the actual completion designs or methodologies also might be a little different in leading to some better results? Travis Stice : No. I think the beauty of the trade is that, we're so confident in the actual well results we're seeing on the Energen acreage. The benefit that we had is on the cost side, so, two organizations that saw eye-to-eye on design and completion size and landing points. But on a cost perspective, combined that's where the real synergies rest. Leo Mariani : Okay. That makes sense. And I guess just looking at your fourth quarter production, it seemed very strong for sure, particularly given the fact that you guys are kind of putting these two companies together in the fourth quarter, certainly seems like it stepped up nice momentum into 2019. I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit to kind of production cadence during the year. Is the growth kind of more mid-year weighted or back-half weighted in '19 or is it pretty ratable throughout the year? Travis Stice : Yes, Leo. I'll tackle the Q4 performance, because I think there are a few important points there. Our base business full year production of 121.4 MBOE per day was significantly above the guidance we presented in Q3. So the base business outperformed by 8,000 to 10,000 barrels a day in Q4 without giving effect to the Energen trade. So I think that was very important. Looking ahead to 2019, we gave a number that the combined business was doing about 250,000 barrels a day in December, once we combine the two companies together. We expect to grow basically ratably through the year. I think D&C CapEx is going to be pretty consistent through the year with some acceleration toward the back half, but we kind of see 20% or so exit-to-exit as being a very important number for us. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess just lastly on cash G&A, I guess your guidance for this year is basically below $1 per BOE, couldn't help to notice your fourth quarter number was around $0.67 per BOE, which I guess is quite a bit below. So, should we be thinking kind of closer to that type of number or is it maybe a little bit upward pressure early in the year if you guys have any severance payments made like that? Travis Stice : All right. I think through the year, you can pick a number between that $0.67 and $1 and be in good shape. We just like to say, under $1 because it's such an industry-leading number. Leo Mariani : Okay, thanks guys. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is open. Michael Hall : Thanks. Appreciate the time. A lot of mine have been addressed. One thing I guess [indiscernible] on the kind of people side of the equation. How are you all situated with people now at this point? Obviously you had a pretty substantial step-up in activity here as you combine the two companies. Are you all set on new hires? How much of the Energen staff came over and just kind of where you are on that front? Travis Stice : Yes, Michael. The operations organization for Energen sat in here in Midland and so I think there is a 250 there that just rolled right into our mix and then we've got some employees that are in Birmingham that are transition employees. So there is still taking care some of the base functions in Birmingham as we wind that office close. And then we were fortunate enough to get some folks to move from Birmingham both into Oklahoma City offices and back here to Midland as well too. So, we are continuing to look to increase headcount as [indiscernible] pointed out. We've got industry leading G&A, but we're going to continue to add the best athletes in the draft that we can find on a -- every quarter. Michael Hall : All right [indiscernible] to join the team. The other I have is just kind of the split of the rigs to the extent you guys can provide any more granularity on, particularly in the Midland Basin side, just curious like how we should think about, yes, just kind of where in the each of these kind of sub operating areas? How much in each of those areas you have -- from a rig count perspective? Travis Stice : Yes. I'd define the Midland Basin and to Northern Midland Basin and then Glasscock County and we're probably going to run about a rig and a half in Glasscock County that gets you to 30 to 35 wells for the year and the rest in Midland Basin rigs, 8.5 or so will be in the Northern Basin area. And Midland Basin will be about 55% of our total wells for the year. The Delaware 45% of total wells for the year, I'd say, rig count wise 10 to 11 rigs with four of those in the Reeves County Energen block and the rest split between our ReWard and Pecos positions. Michael Hall : Okay, that's super helpful. If I might, just one last on the grow and prune strategy. Where would you say you have the best opportunity for the growth side of that equation as it relates to these trades and swaps, which of these little sub areas do you think are the most likely to change over the course of the next year or look more blocky, I guess? Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, I think, you look at what we did in Spanish Trail North with a series of trades and now we're actively blocking that up. I think you still have some work to do around our ReWard position and certainly in the [indiscernible] Northern Delaware Basin Energen position -- legacy Energen position there is a lot of non-operated properties around there that we prefer to operate given our cost structure, and I think we're going to be actively working to block that area up and trade non-opposition for non-operated position. Michael Hall : All right. Thanks very much, congrats on the solid quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks, Michael. Michael Hollis : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eli Kantor with IFS Securities. Your line is open. Eli Kantor : Hi, good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning. Eli Kantor : I couldn't help notice the big increase in your other locations within the inventory breakdown you gave on Slide 14. Can you give some additional detail on what percent of those locations are operated versus non-op? What intervals comprise this other category? How the locations are split across those various intervals and our development of the other locations will compete for capital relative to locations you break out the Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring? Michael Hollis : Yes. I'll take that one. Energen kept more Wolfcamp C and Wolfcamp B inventory than Diamondback did in the Midland Basin and had more exposure to it than we did for that. So, that makes up a good amount of the other category. Non-op is about 400 net non-op locations as well. And that comprises a good piece. Now on the Delaware side, Energen had some Avalon and Brushy Canyon locations where we don't have that in the Southern Delaware Basin. Eli Kantor : And then, in terms of this upcoming monetization of Rattler. You talked about the various considerations being made and deciding what percent of the equity you ultimately show. Travis Stice : No, we can talk about that Eli. It's on file with the SEC and we\u2019re going to look at S1 filing on online. Eli Kantor : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks again to everyone participating in today\u2019s call. If you got any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Diamondback Energy First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Sidney. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to Diamondback's First Quarter 2019 Conference Call. After closing the Energen acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2018, we ensured that Diamondback got off to a fast start in 2019 and showcased the strength of our operations organization and the low-cost structure on a larger scale. We navigated the $30 drop in fourth quarter oil prices by immediately cutting activity to start 2019 while still growing production 5% from our December 2018 exit rate of 250,000 barrels a day, all while integrating our $9 billion acquisition of Energen and the addition of over 300 employees to the Diamondback family. I'm going to pause and take a minute to give credit to all of the employees within Diamondback for working together with the new, significantly larger group of colleagues and executing on this plan seamlessly. Both the Diamondback and former Energen employees have learned best practices from each other, and the results have shown through in the capital and operating costs presented in our first full quarter as a combined company. Our first quarter results and revised expectations for capital cost reflect the execution of the synergies presented in the merger presentation with Energen last August. Diamondback is on pace to achieve our previously disclosed synergy targets earlier than expected, and we will look to continue to push efficiency and drive down cash operating costs. Diamondback spent $627 million on CapEx in the first quarter and generated $675 million of EBITDA with $8 per barrel cash operating costs, including $0.55 per barrel G&A. We completed 82 wells in the quarter and are maintaining our expectations to bring on between 290 and 320 wells this year from a $2.7 billion to $3 billion capital budget. Capital discipline is important to Diamondback, and we have no intention to exceed this budget or well count in 2019 regardless of commodity price. From a Corporate Development perspective, we executed on our grow and prune strategy by signing definitive agreements to divest the conventional assets acquired from Energen as well as noncore acreage in Crockett and Reagan counties. These transactions are expected to close by July 1, and as a result, we have lowered our full year production guidance to account for the production expected to be lost from these properties in the back half of the year. We also lowered our full year LOE guidance by $0.25 a barrel to account for the higher operating cost structure of these assets. Secondly, we also contributed the oil gathering and saltwater disposal assets acquired in the Energen acquisition into our midstream subsidiary, Rattler Midstream, with market-based contracts in place. Lastly, we are actively working on dropping down the remaining mineral and royalty assets held at the Diamondback level to Viper and expect to do so at some point in 2019. Most important in this quarter, our Board of Directors has authorized up to $2 billion capital return program to be executed in the form of a stock repurchase program in the end of year 2020. This program is a direct reflection of the confidence we have in our business plan and free cash flow outlook given the improvement in commodity prices from the original 2019 budgeting process, our capital budget control and the expected improvement in our oil realizations as legacy fixed differential contracts have rolled off and we move more of our barrels to the Gulf Coast. With this announcement, we have set a clear use of proceeds for this free cash flow and expect to generate over $750 million of free cash flow from operations in 2020 at $55 WTI. Over the long term, the consistent growth of our dividend will remain our primary return of capital objective, but this repurchase program represents the next step in our total return strategy and the evolution into a large-cap commune pure-play. At a high level, our capital allocation philosophy is grounded on achieving pure leading year-over-year growth, supporting a growing dividend, reducing debt consistently and continuing to replace and maintain a deep inventory at Tier 1 acreage. Excess free cash flow above this will be returned to stockholders. Diamondback will not spend every dollar of free cash flow on growth or acquisitions. Put simply, we feel buying back our stock is the best acquisition opportunity we see today given our outlook and the multiple visible catalysts ahead. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : Travis, go right into that what you had mentioned, the biggest news obviously in the release being the material stock buyback announcement. Could you all speak to your expectations for future production growth in the out years, assuming you continue with this impressive buyback? I guess what I'm getting at is do you all still forecast growth to stay around that 26% stated target level that you've laid out today or in the -- I guess in the slides, given -- assuming this material shareholder return initiative would continue? Travis Stice : Sure, Neal. Obviously, we're not going to give multiyear guidance on what our growth rate is going to be. But I think if you look at what our growth rate was last year, between 40% and 50%, this year, it's around 26%, look, the law of big numbers eventually catch up with you. And we're still going to be growing in the upcoming years, but I think the key word here is growth. I think we're going to continue -- we are going to continue to spend less than we make, and we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders as part of our total return philosophy. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just one follow-up. Could you talk about maybe just on a good capital budget? I'm trying to -- what I'm getting to -- what I'm trying to look at is basically in your capital budget you've disclosed, I'm wondering if you include acreage acquisitions, equity investments, VNOM acquisition, the whole bit, I think you are around, what, $300-ish billion or something in first quarter. I'm just wondering is that a good run rate and then really trying to frame that in the context of generating the cash flow and needing that to buy back the stock. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Neal, I'll take that one. Yes, I mean the capital budget, $2.7 billion to $3 billion, is drilling and completion, midstream and infrastructure. On top of that, we have our equity investments in the Gray Oak and the EPIC pipelines, which are going to be held in our Rattler subsidiary. And we really don't consider onetime proceeds, whether that's asset sales or asset purchases, in that budget. So really, the key message is free cash flow is going to be operating cash flow less the CapEx budget and the dividend that we plan to grow continuously. Neal Dingmann : So Kaes, is that cash flow that you'll use to buy back the stock, you won't do that with debt or something? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : No. No plans. Operator : And our following question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Following up on the plan to return cash to investors, can you just talk a little bit about the priorities of paying down the revolver versus share repurchase? And then how are you expecting to time the share repurchase portion relative to expected versus actual free cash flow and expected versus actual asset sales and monetization proceeds? Travis Stice : Sure, Brian. We've committed to reducing our debt. I think our debt to -- our leverage ratio is around 1.9, and we'll probably get that reduced here pretty quickly. Kaes, do you want to answer the back part of that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. The revolver right now is $1.9 billion, Brian. We're going to get that down by $700 million or $800 million with onetime proceeds on the free cash flow piece. It's really what we see in the model in Q2 through Q4 of this year and then 2020 at nearly any commodity price, let alone strip. The majority of that free cash flow is going to go back to shareholders in the form of this buyback. Brian Singer : Great. And then shifting to the assets in the broader consolidation landscape, you've never been shy to participate in consolidation. You talked about the grow and prune strategy. Can you just talk about the landscape that you see out there, both in terms of further pruning asset transactions like what you announced here with the noncore asset sale, bolt-on acquisitions to further that scale and then potential for larger-scale M&A? Travis Stice : We've been pretty clear that doing a little acquisition, the bolt-ons, where we can take advantage of Diamondback's operation prowess, are just part of our DNA, so we're going to continue to do those. As any good capital allocator, I think it's important to always look at your portfolio and look at those late-life assets to figure out whether or not they make more sense in your hands or someone else's hands. And what we just did, the majority of those late-life assets or low-value assets by selling $322 million of them. And then on the larger deals, I'm not really going to speculate on the larger deals that are out there. I think very clearly my job is to create value with working for shareholders that own the company. And today, we really feel like that's best accomplished through best-in-class execution or low-cost operations and delivering on the outlet that we just presented. My job, really -- I can't really speculate on what goes on in the industry M&A. It's rather to discuss what I know and what I can control and what my responsibility is, which is to drive shareholder value. Operator : And our following question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on your strong update decision to pursue a meaningful share repurchase. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : For Travis, this is an open-ended question for you on a related topic to Brian's last question. As you guys know, M&A has been a topic of increasing interest among investors. Based on really your success and the progression you've made from midcap to bellweather status, could you share with us your views on the merits of zero premium mergers among your former midcap peers to create advantaged pro forma companies and the scale and overhead synergies that come along with that? And I think to some degree, we all live in spreadsheets, but I imagine the execution is quite a bit harder than perceived. Travis Stice : Yes. Certainly, execution is a lot harder than the spreadsheet. And I think we learned that in our early days. But again, Derrick, I just want to focus on what I know, and that's -- my job is to represent what Diamondback does and control these best-in-class operations and really pristine execution. And really, all I know about what's going on in the larger space is what I read in the press, and I don't want to be the industry spokesman talking about what goes on in the M&A world. I'm really focused on what message I can deliver to the, say, the shareholders that own Diamondback. And that's what we're trying to accomplish. Derrick Whitfield : Completely, sir. And then as my follow-up, perhaps for Mike. I mentioned this to you guys last night, but your track record in driving increasingly lower completed well cost has been remarkable. If you were to assume Frankenstein wells in those basins, where would that theoretically place your well cost in peripheral lateral? Michael Hollis : Absolutely, Derrick. So on both basins, we always look at that kind of the technical limit well, and we always strive to push that. And what we find is that technical limit keeps moving. So we're past some of the technical limits we had a year or 2 ago, so they keep moving. So I don't have a direct answer for you because we're a learning, growing organization that's going to continue to drive that efficiency and cost control. But with that said, the answer is continually lower than it is today. Operator : And our following question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Travis, I think it's great that the concentration -- what Diamondback can do, and you guys do it so well. When you look at the business at a whole, what do you think is that one area that just continues to improve on, that one -- that low-hanging fruit that might still exist when you look at the next 12 to 18 months from a standpoint of cost structure, lowering expenses but just overall improving that cash margin and driving incremental shareholder return? Travis Stice : Yes. Gail, it's not just one thing. And I think that's actually where you can get yourself in trouble if you just inordinately focus on one thing. It's really the combination of all the things that fit into that low-cost operations and really good execution. And I believe we've got an organization that understands their role in delivering on those. And so our focus is continually on those items that drive efficiency even if sometimes if you had to spend more because it's an emerging technology. If it translates to low overall cost, well, we'll embrace that as well, too. So there's nothing, we're just trying to squeeze every penny. We, of course, try to do that, but we also look for the best way to do things that have -- are going to have the greatest impact on our overall portfolio. And I'm really impressed with our new organization that essentially doubled in size in November as to how quickly everyone now, all the Diamondback employees, embraced that concept. Gail Nicholson : And then looking at the drilled co well that are well-aligned this quarter, very solid results. Can you just give a little more color around that area and kind of what you guys think about that going forward? And then what needs to be done from the standpoint of infrastructure run out down there? Travis Stice : Yes. Obviously, we're very impressed with the initial wells that we drilled down there, some of the best wells we've actually drilled in Pecos County. And we're going to continue to develop that with our business partner, and we've got some midstream down there that our Rattler business is actively developing now. And also Viper has been acquiring minerals down in that area as well, too, so which -- it's a good example of how Diamondback's different companies are really driving a lot of value for our investors. Operator : And our following question comes from the line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital. Jeffrey Grampp : Travis, in your prepared remarks, you said not only is there a strict focus on maintaining -- spending within the CapEx budget but also that you wouldn't go over your completed well count guidance. And I guess just wanted to make sure I understand it mechanically, if you guys were at a point where dollar rise should be within budget but efficiencies were driving the completed well count higher. Should we expect Diamondback to curtail drilling rigs and/or completions in that type of scenario? And how does that kind of set up -- how do you guys think about setting up for the 2020 program? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Jeff, no, we're not planning to go over that 320 gross well count for the year. I think it would be very hard for us to hit the lower half our budget with that higher half of the completed well count. That's certainly our target. So we like to think about things at the midpoint and beating the midpoint on the best side of that guidance. So with the $2.7 billion to $3 billion budget, we're thinking internally here, we got to beat $2.85 billion. Jeffrey Grampp : Okay. And on the prune side of the equation there, obviously, you got the nice sale in the books. Is there anything else that you guys feel kind of compelled to turn into cash in the next, say, 6 to 12 months? I imagine you guys are always open for business if someone made you a good offer on some backdated inventory. But is there any kind of proactive effort internally to prune any other additional assets? Travis Stice : Yes. Again, Jeff, as I said, as big capital allocators, you've always got to be aware of that. But I'll tell you right now, where our G&A is focused is we've got a lot of other initiatives we're working on right now. That's -- I'm very proud that we're able to get that divestiture done. It represents delivery on one of the synergies that we talked about at the acquisition time. And so like I said, any opportunity, we'll take a look at. But right now, we're focused on delivering on some of these other corporate objectives, like maintaining our focus on low-cost operations. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up on cost and capital. CapEx performance in the quarter was clearly impressive, particularly on the D&C side, I mean -- which probably makes sense given how cost synergies are tracking. But can you talk about the primary drivers of a lower-than-expected CapEx, whether you feel those are sustainable? And although it's early, whether -- what you see is the potential downside risk to deploy our budget or I guess at least the bottom half of the budget? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Ryan, we made a promise in December that we're going to cut activity and cut activity right away. And we've delivered on that in the first quarter. We dropped 2 spreads immediately and dropped 3 drilling rigs. I think the combined organization, we've learned a lot of things from the Energen folks and vice versa. And we've started to push down costs on the service cost side. So a lot of it's going to be permanent but some help from the service side in the first quarter. Ryan Todd : Great. And then maybe not meant to be a follow-up on M&A but really one on scale, your -- there's another operator in the Permian Basin that recently referred to optimal scale as being somewhere between 6 and 20 rigs in the basin and as the benefit decreases, you move much beyond that. We've got another large operator that seems to be suggesting that they worry about having the longer-term scale necessary to compete in the Permian. You guys are -- obviously have a good amount of scale there. I mean how do you think about your scale and position long term in the basin and the type of scale that you think you need or have to compete? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Ryan, I'm not going to comment on any peer's commentary. That's up to their opinion. For us, speaking about Diamondback Energy, we certainly have seen a benefit of scale between where we were in August prior to the Energen merger and post that deal. We're certainly seeing the benefits on the cost side and a ton of benefits on the operations side of the two companies being put together. Travis Stice : Look, Brian, we've grown the company from essentially no horizontal rigs to where we are today, over 20 horizontal rigs. And regardless of what the right cadence is, and I think that's dependent on each company, our objective is whether it's 1 rig or 20 rigs, is to be the low-cost operator of that rig. And our unique organizational focus remains on being best-in-class executors and the lowest-cost operators, whether we're running 1 rig, 20 rigs or 40 rigs. So I don't know how to calibrate what the right number of rigs are, but I do know that whatever number of rigs Diamondback is running, we're going to be best-in-class and the lowest-cost operator. Just to add to that, the other thing is that scale also requires you being able to be in control of your infrastructure, which is the reason that we have an infrastructure company set up so that we can maintain control of that. Larger you get, the bigger and bigger piece of your importance to your strategy and your and execution development is being able to control the infrastructure. And that's why we're -- that's why we've got a nice infrastructure company inside Diamondback. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Just curious on -- you guys are -- seem to be ahead of schedule in realizing the savings on the Midland side. I guess you're expecting to take another $20 per foot out of the well cost heading into 2020. Where do you see that most likely coming from at this point? It looks like the contract side of it on the service side has been realized. So just looking, how do we take another $20 out? And then when you look at the Delaware Basin well costs, certain elements that we've realized on the Midland side haven't yet made their way over the -- to the Delaware, particularly, it looks like on service costs and to some extent, on cycle times. When do you see that sort of catching up on the Delaware side? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : David, I'll take the first question first. And the $20, the additional $20 in the Midland side was what we captured in January. So that is already in place, and we've demonstrated that this quarter. On the Delaware side going forward, so again, we're not going as far along in the development of the Delaware side as we are on the Midland side. So again, based on terms kind of third, fourth inning. So we're seeing a lot of changes in how we're drilling the wells, pad development, completion techniques, casing designs, removing casing strings, reducing what we're doing on these wells and getting better results. So you're going to see a higher rate of change over the next near-term period in the Delaware compared to the Midland side. But the numbers that we presented today is what we saw in first quarter. David Deckelbaum : Got it. I appreciate that. And then just, my second question. If you think about having in 2020 that -- you guys put out a PDP decline of about 36% this year and 32% I think going into 2020, if I recall. Is that solely a function of the cadence of wells coming online? Or is there sort of an assumed benefit from managing the base of it better in terms of nonproductive downtime? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : It's really just the benefit of having more wells on longer and slowing down the natural growth rate, right? I mean if you look back to 2016 to today, we went from 4 operated rigs to 22. That's going to really increase the treadmill over that time period. Now with us at 21 rigs today and not looking to add 6 or 7 rigs a year anymore, naturally, your PDP decline rate is going slow. So I mean we see that declining by about 5% from 2019 to 2020. Operator : And our following question comes from Asit Sen with Bank of America. Asit Sen : Appreciate the free cash flow guidance for 2020 at the $55 WTI. Just wondering what CapEx or rig count assumption has been factored in that number? And also any additional synergies beyond the secondary synergies that you have laid out are you factoring anything in? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Asit, I mean the biggest things we're factoring in is we're at 21 rigs today. I don't expect us to add more than 1 or 2 rigs in 2020. From a capital perspective, it's natural that if oil stays where it is, that service cost being recalibrated a bit to the higher side. So there's some conservatism baked into that number. Most importantly, our oil marketing contracts get significantly better in Q2 this year. But looking into 2020, we'll be exporting a majority of our barrels down to the Gulf Coast. That's going to help us from a realization perspective. Asit Sen : Okay. And my next question is actually on Slide 14, where it looks like the average completed lateral length has stayed fairly steady over the past several quarters. Is there an opportunity to push that number higher? And just wondering if you have any thoughts on where you see optimal pad size evolving based on your current footprint in both sides of the basin. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I'll let Mike handle the optimal pad size, but from a completed lateral length, we're going to be around that 9,500-foot level for a while. Our goal from a business development perspective is to make sure we have 10,000-foot laterals at least across our whole portfolio. So we're going to be moving at the margin, but every 100 feet certainly makes a difference from a capital efficiency perspective. Michael Hollis : And Asit, on the Midland Basin side, we have well pads as large as 12-, 16-well pads. Again, it's area-specific. There's a lot of factors that go into what makes the optimal. And actually, the team does a great job of figuring out what that is in each one of our geographic areas. And if you go to the Delaware Basin, of course, the wells produce a lot more fluid than we have on the Midland Basin side. So typically, the pad sizes will be smaller. So there, typically we're a 2- to 3-, somewhere as up to four well pads right now. Over time, that may grow, but it won't grow to the level that we have in the Midland Basin side in the near term. Operator : And our following question comes from Tim Rezvan with Oppenheimer. Timothy Rezvan : I wanted to switch topics a bit and move to the Carlyle JV. You announced a couple of very strong wells last night. And on the heels of that, I was wondering if you could give a bit of a refresher on kind of what could happen with that JV, how material kind of that could be? And really, if it could influence sort of drilling within or kind of around that JV area in Pecos County. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Tim, yes, we're certainly pleased with those well results. It's really going to be up to our partner and Carlyle to elect to go to the next tranche of wells, and we're expecting that imminently over the long term. And I think we're confident enough in the northern half of that acreage that if we didn't have a partner, we'd drill it ourselves. We've bought a lot of minerals and have a lot of midstream in place and the well results compete with the main block. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. And then on the next tranche, how many wells would that be? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : It would be just drilling out the northern half and some southern half wells. From a Diamondback perspective, it'd be a very low capital amount. Timothy Rezvan : Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. And then just to hammer the repurchase kind of seem a bit more, I know, Travis, you've talked with them, they've -- you see accretion and perpetuity from the repurchases. What kind of price sensitivity do you see around that if we assume, all else equal, but shares come back to that 2018 high, $135 or higher? Would you still plan to execute this? Or do you feel like there is sort of a tactical nature to the intensity based on what the share price is doing? Travis Stice : Yes. So look, we're committed to this capital share return program, and I think we've allowed ourselves enough flexibility to figure out what the best way to drive that value to our shareholders is going to be, whether it's in the form of cash or share repurchases. And that's something the Board will continue to evaluate. But the key here is that this is not just a onetime event. This is the Board's signaling that this is an ongoing return of capital strategy that's underpinned by our free cash flow growth profile and our production growth profile well into the future. Operator : And our following question comes from Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Andrew Venker : I just want to follow-up a little bit on the M&A. You've had excellent success pursuing that and delivering on the synergies you promised with the Energen merger. It's not always the case that with large, corporate M&A, the synergies that actually come through and they're quite visible. And from our perspective, it seems like there's still a number of opportunities where you could put your operational model and cost structure on other assets and extract a lot of value at the same time with your buyback announcements. We'd like to think your stock is really under appreciated. Can you just talk about how you think about the potential opportunities in the space and how you balance that with the way you see your stock price right now? Travis Stice : Yes. Drew, again, I just don't -- it's just not my role to speculate on basin-wide M&A activities. I think the signal that we've put forth today is that we believe that repurchasing our shares represents the greatest value in the M&A front. And that's a $2 billion acquisition that we're talking about. Andrew Venker : Certainly, Travis, we'd agree. Your stock is very accretive. So in terms of the $2 billion buyback, can you talk about the -- that figure specifically? Can you talk about funding it with full free cash flow and proceeds from asset sales? Is that $2 billion number, you think you have line of sight to? Or is that -- incorporate a potential upside of proceeds from asset sales of free cash flow to prices to the upside? Are there upside to the $2 billion number? How do you guys think about that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Drew, that's the number for now. If we outperform, then we'll go back and talk to our Board and adjust accordingly. But we see at strip. And with the catalyst we have on the proceeds side, we certainly see visibility to executing on that number through the end of 2020. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Jeoffrey Lambujon : My first one is just a follow-up on the free cash flow in 2020 at $55 WTI commentary. I know that a lot of the moving pieces like service recalibration, for example, you just mentioned would flex alongside changes in crude pricing. But are there any sensitivities that you can share with us around that free cash flow figure as you think about variability in WTI? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Jeoff, we've always reacted to WTI to flex up or down at the margin. I think what's changing now is that our plan is pretty set, and there's not going to be a wild swing in rig count up. Now there might be a wild swing in rig count down if we have to adjust if this commodity falls out of bed. But overall, we feel like we're creating an execution machine that's going to complete a little over 300 wells this year and a little bit of growth on top of that next year. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. Appreciate that. And then my second one is just on the timing of activity. Is there any additional detail you can speak to on both how Q1 played out? And maybe what your thoughts are just on the rest of the year, just towards giving us a sense what we could expect in terms of production trajectory from here and how timing can play into that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. No, I certainly think we're going to grow into Q2. We completed 82 wells in Q1, with 19 of those wells coming on in the last 2 weeks of the year. So we're certainly going to grow into Q2. Q3 will be the first month without the 6,500 barrels a day of production that we listed as for sale. That's expected to close July 1, so I expect us to grow into Q3, just not as much as Q2. And then another consistent quarter into Q4. Operator : And our next question comes from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : I wonder if I could ask you about some Delaware Basin assets that we don't seem to talk a lot about, at least with you guys. And that's really that north-central lugging it into Lea County. My sense is that's some of the most valuable acreage on a per acre basis in the Permian. But you don't really seem to have that -- the scale there that you have in like your ReWard area or in your other places within the basin. So with what you see, do you -- are those assets more likely, you think, to be on the grow side of your strategy or more likely on the prune side? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : We certainly have a substantial enough position that we can execute on the capital plan there. It's not as big as our other core development areas. Our business development team is actively working to trade and block up that acreage to increase the operated positions. I think we -- with the Energen acquisition, we acquired a lot more non-op than we traditionally have had at Diamondback. So we're doing our best to translate that non-op position into a slightly larger operated position. We're certainly not opposed to operating in New Mexico because of the well results in that area. And we're kind of planning to do that if we can build that position a little bit. Charles Meade : Got it. That's helpful. And so I'd say if you can transition it to operated, then it would make more sense. But Travis, I want to go back to... Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : There's an operated position there today. Our job is to make sure that operated position grows, and so it's more attractive for us to develop long term. Charles Meade : Got it. Got it. And then in terms of -- I want to go back to a comment you've made once in your prepared remarks, and you repeated here in the Q&A when you said that buying back your own stock is the best acquisition opportunity you see. And I'll have to a little bit -- first, I'm going to say that because I thought to myself that there's probably some other operators looking and seeing the same thing. But I wanted to ask -- my question to you is what are the metrics that you use -- or that you're willing to share with us that you use to look to span that space between looking at an acquisition opportunity that's a publicly traded equity even if it's your own versus looking at a discrete asset purchase? Travis Stice : Well, certainly, the cash flow profile of any acquisition target now is among the top things that we evaluate. We're -- we want cash flow per share accretion, and -- but then all the other thing still need to matter, right? I mean it's got to be accretive on reserves, and it's got to be in the top quartile of our portfolio so that we can immediately allocate capital to it and bring our operations excellence to the assets. So I think as we reach to scale that we're at right now and this continued commitment of living within cash flow that we've demonstrated -- announced it since 2015, the cash flow component of an acquisition targets is really important. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think on top of that, Charles, if you think about it from an engineering perspective, we feel that we're trading in the high-teens PV with a 9% cost of capital. So buying back our stock is a great use of that capital. Travis Stice : And back on the targets, I can't count the number of times I've used the word accretive. It's got to be an accretive trade and there's certainly those metrics I laid out to you, we've got to look for accretion on that. And then we'll never do anything that'll put Mike's organization at risk of not being best-in-class executor. So... Charles Meade : Honestly guys, that's helpful insight. That -- it's that focus on the near-term cash flow accretion. So I appreciate those comments. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Just quickly back to the CapEx theme, maybe for Kaes. Obviously, capital spend in trend is off to a very favorable start in 1Q. How does it set up the cadence for the rest of the year? Is there perhaps some bigger infrastructure spend in any 1 particular quarter? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Richard, I think from the infrastructure perspective, the Rattler budget, which is the midstream budget, is going to be fairly consistent through the year on a quarterly basis. We spent about a quarter of that budget in Q1. On the infrastructure side, we expect that piece to pick up a bit in Q2 and Q3. That number was about 19% of the total budget for the year. And then on the D&C side, I think we're going to have a little bit higher working interest and a little bit higher average lateral length in the second quarter. So I think it's logical that the D&C gross CapEx number picks up a bit with that higher working interest. Richard Tullis : Okay. And for Travis, at the DUG Permian Conference a couple of weeks ago, there was a private operator discussing some solid Barnett oil well results that we're seeing near your Limelight acreage. What is your outlook for that acreage? I know it's not a big position, but how do you see that acreage playing out? And when do you expect to begin appraisal there? Travis Stice : It'll probably be a fourth quarter event this year, maybe first quarter next year. But we're still excited about that block we put together. Really, really low cost. And we're pleased to see offset results that continue to support our thesis as to why that was a good area to explore. Operator : And our following question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. Michael Hall : Well done on the execution this quarter. Just curious if you still have a decent amount of inventory, I guess, particularly in the Midland Basin and kind of the other category. I'm just curious if you have any plans for appraising any of that or derisking any of that over the course of 2019. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Michael, I think we've always been a fast follower, and we're very focused on the highest rate of return zones. We're certainly codeveloping more zones and as well as A&D. I think in that other category, we've seen some really good results from some offset operators that might change our plans in the future but not in a meaningful way. I think from an overall capital allocation perspective, the highest rate of return zones are still going to get the vast majority of our capital. Michael Hall : All right. Understood. And then I guess more of a technical question. Just curious on the buyback. It sounded like your intention is to get started with that here in the near term. In light of some of the remaining potential transactions over the course of the year, are there any restrictions in terms of timing on when you can implement that buyback over the course of 2019? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Not to my knowledge today. We expect to implement the buyback and sort of buying back stock in the second quarter here. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Jason Wangler : Just had one. As you kind of move forward with the share repurchase and you think about on the hedging side of it, obviously, the basis differential should just keep getting later, basically, and you've talked about. But how should we think about how you think on the hedging side as you kind of shift to this new kind of formula for the company? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean, it changes a little bit, fortunately, for us. By 2021, I don't think we're going to be worrying about the basis hedge anymore with all our barrels at the Gulf Coast. In 2020, there'll still be some barrels priced at the WTI Midland price. But as it relates to hedging, you'll see that we hedged about 25% of our 2020 production in the quarter with pretty wide collars. I think protecting the downside is more important to us than the straight swaps. But we're still going to probably try to hedge about 50% of our production on a go-forward basis. And most of that via the collars and then a little bit of swaps on top. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I was hoping to see maybe if you could put a few numbers in terms of the completion cadence? I know you guys certainly had 82 wells in the first quarter. Is there any help you can sort of give us on maybe that number that we would expect to see in sort of 2Q, 3Q and 4Q this year? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Leo, we don't give quarterly guidance. And I'm going to stick to the plan that we're going to complete 290 to 320 gross wells. We're probably leaning towards the higher half of that at the lower half of our budget. And that's our plan right now. From a cadence perspective, we're running 8 spreads. It's about the number that we're going to run, so it's going to be a pretty consistent turn in lines throughout the year. Leo Mariani : All right. And I guess just with respect to the initiatives on the buyback, I think you guys talked about $700 million to $800 million of debt reduction this year. Obviously, you got the $322 million asset sale and there are some other drop-downs and some other initiatives sort of working here. But just kind of wanted to understand the $2 billion magnitude. So should we assume that any asset sale proceeds above the debt reduction of $700 million to $800 million this year and then any other free cash flow that in 2019, that pretty much all goes to the buyback? And then as you work into next year, should we assume that there's some type of dividend increase that's to occur and really all the rest of the free cash flow goes to the buyback? Is that the right way to think about it? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean, I don't want to commit to a number of how much we're going to buy back quarter over quarter. I think in 2019, we're looking to get started really quickly here. And then in 2020, as we consistently grow and have a consistent amount of free cash flow throughout the year, the buyback program becomes more programmatic. And that along with the dividend becomes a part of our multiyear total return philosophy. Operator : And am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Josh. Good morning. And welcome to Diamondback Energy Second Quarter 2019 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's Web site. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; Mike Hollis, President and COO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, CFO.During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone. And thank you for listening to Diamondback second quarter 2019 conference call. Diamondback continued to execute in the second quarter of 2019. We produced record EBITDA per share from 7% quarter-over-quarter production growth, while lowering the midpoint of our capital cost guidance and increasing the midpoints of both our full year production guidance and estimated completed well count for the year. Diamondback has now grown earnings per share at 11% quarterly CAGR and EBITDA per share by 9% quarterly, since our IPO in late 2012.Based on second quarter numbers, Diamondback now generates more annualized EBITDA per share than our IPO price seven years ago. Diamondback continues to focus on per share metrics with shareholders now owning more production, cash flow and earnings per share than prior to our acquisition of Energen a year ago even in the face of a lower commodity price environment. Diamondback's per lateral foot well costs, which include every dollar in bringing our operated wells to production and the first six months of production related costs thereafter, are down 7% year-over-year in the Midland Basin and 16% year-over-year in the Delaware Basin. As a result, we are narrowing the midpoint of our 2019 capital budget and increasing the midpoint of our operated completions, which implies over $110 of improved capital efficiency per completed lateral foot versus our initial budget presented in December. Our operations organization continues to drive material costs out of the business with expectations for continued tailwind due to improved efficiencies and service cost deflation.With respect to the Energen acquisition and subsequent integration, Diamondback has now completed every major strategic objective and exceeded our stated synergies presented one year ago when we announced the deal. In the second quarter, we completed the IPO of our midstream business Rattler, raising over $720 million net to Diamondback. We also recently announced the dropdown of over 5,000 net royalty acres to Viper for $700 million of gross proceeds, including $150 million in cash.Lastly, we recently completed the sale of the conventional central basin platform assets acquired via the Energen acquisition. As a result of completing these objectives, Diamondback immediately commenced our stock repurchase program by repurchasing $104 million of stock in the second quarter after reducing our consolidated net debt by $400 million quarter-over-quarter. We intend to use the majority of the remainder of these proceeds, along with increasing free cash flow from operations, to continue our stock repurchase program. Our balance sheet is strong with both absolute debt levels and leverage metrics low, and we will continue to return capital to shareholders via our share repurchase program and dividend. At current valuations, we continue to feel the best use of our free capital at Diamondback is buying back our own stock.With respect to oil realizations, we believe the worst of our widest basis differential quarters are behind us. And we now expect to realize greater than 95% of WTI pricing for the second half of 2019. By early next year, we expect to realize oil prices at parity with greater than WTI, as our existing commitments convert to the Gray Oak and EPIC pipelines and receive grant or coastal pricing. With our recently announced commitment to the Wink to Webster pipeline, we will have full exposure to the Houston and Corpus Christi local refining and export markets by 2021, removing in-basin pricing risks from our future business model.In closing, Diamondback continues to execute on the promises presented at the time of the Energen acquisition, and our business is nearing a significant free cash flow inflection point in the second half of 2019 and into 2020. We may no longer be maximizing growth within cash flow, but we are not sacrificing growth in 2020 as we expect to grow at industry-leading rates for large cap E&P and deliver over $750 million free cash flow at $55 oil due to our best-in-class cost structure, asset quality and operating metrics.With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global. You may proceed with your question. Mike Kelly : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Travis, I flipped through the slide deck here, it's pretty apparent that guys have really checked the box, and a whole bunch of aggressive objectives over the last year. Really just kind of wanted to get the thoughts on what's on your mind now and kind of what's your refreshed strategic to-do list look like as we sit here today? Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks Mike. Yes, our strategic objective there is not really any new ones. We're going to maintain our commitment to execution and capital efficiency, that's part of our core business practices as just about anything. We're continued at the board level to grow the dividends and we've committed to this free cash flow return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. So while we clicked off some pretty significant objectives, those were onetime events in the first seven months of this year. We're committed long-term to this shareholder return program and we're pretty confident we'll be able to deliver on it. Mike Kelly : Okay, thanks. And maybe the follow up on that, you just mentioned to that $750 million of free cash flow in 2020 with industry leading growth still in the works. What would get you to maybe dial down that growth a little bit and to up the ante on free cash flow? Just kind of curious just to hear maybe your philosophical thoughts on that growth versus the free cash flow balance. Thank you. Travis Stice : It's not an exact science, the way that we look at the future. If commodity prices roll over further, we're certain we're going to look at our forward model and make adjustments accordingly, probably in the form of dropping one or two rigs. But our future is really bright, Mike. With the way that we continue to execute with our overall cash costs in the mid-8s right now, we're profitable significantly, every barrel that produce for long life from this current oil price. So we're pretty confident. We've got a lot of still exciting things to deliver in the future. And I think the future at Diamondback is really bright. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. You may proceed with your question. Neal Dingmann : Travis, going through the release about your low capital cost continued to be notable. And so I guess my question is around those. How do these factor in when allocating capital between thinking about production growth versus buyback or other shareholder initiatives? Travis Stice : Neal, it's not really an either or, I think it's an and. And I think we can -- we're one of the few companies that can do both. We can still grow and we can repurchase shares and further returns to our shareholder. So we don't pivot on that. We actually look at a way to combine, both growth and returns for our shareholders. Neal Dingmann : And then my follow up just as we're on Slide 10 on your -- looking at the spacing, it appears to me, and I was looking at this versus some prior presentations even going back to years. And it appears to me like your assumptions haven't changed for quite some time. And I'm just wondering could there be, potentially looking at this, some down-spacing opportunities, or you sort of content with this? I just wondering, obviously, there is a lot of scrutiny these days on that. So maybe anything you could say around your assumptions and how this has or hasn't and maybe will change? Travis Stice : Neal, I went back into the same thing. I want to see how long this slide deck have been in our, or this slide had been in our slide deck. And I think it goes back like four years. And I think I've said a thousand times it's easier strategically to add locations than it is takeaway locations. And we've always been conservative in our spacing assumptions, and we don't really have any plans right now, especially as commodity price continues to decline, to look at any reasons to increase well spacing. This is one of those things where we've been pretty steadfast in our strategic development objectives on spacing. It's been underpinned by our annual reserve reports. And we would pay attention to other spacing results that go on in the Permian basin. And we try to learn from those as well too without exposing our shareholders to down spacing risks. So, I'm very comfortable with our spacing assumptions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. You may proceed with your question. Derrick Whirfield : Good morning all, and congrats on strong update. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whirfield : Perhaps for Travis, your capital efficiency and now disclosure standard, there's last night's release, are peer leading. What in your view makes your organization so successful at cost control? Travis Stice : Derrick, we get that question coming from a lot of different angles over different quarters, and I'll tell you it's not just one thing. It's really a combination of a thousand things. I mean we just finished an operational review getting ready for this quarter several weeks ago and the drilling organization certainly and an analysis of the connection time, how fast you screw pipe together, where they cut not quite a minute, I think 0.7 of a minute per connection for every well that we drilled with 20 rigs in the second quarter. And that translate -- you say, well, that's not -- so what will -- that's a dollar a foot per well, 5 times 20 rigs. And it's that level of scrutiny across our costs spend that I think truly differentiates our operations organization.I mean we say around here, you got to inspect what you expect that's one of our operating mantras. And really our business is not that complicated. It's converting rock into cash flow. And you've got to measure every facet of that conversion process to ensure you're most efficient. And I think we've got a great machine. I mean, if we didn't have the machine that we have, we couldn't have delivered on the results, the cost results after doing $10 billion worth of acquisitions at the end of last year. I mean it's hard for me to believe that today our D, C and E full well costs are lower on a combined basis with Energen, than they were on the Diamondback standalone basis a year ago.And that to me represent seamless integration of an acquisition. And we did so while accomplishing all of these corporate objectives that I laid out in my prepared remarks. And most importantly, we did it while adding over 300 people to our organization. So I think it's a remarkable feat for our organization to have accomplished what we did in this earnings release and in this quarter.Our economics are better than they've ever been. We're more profitable. We've got more operational capability. I mean, just across the board, we're firing on all cylinders. And it's unfortunate in this market backdrop. But we're going to be okay, because our cost structure and because our execution prowess, our capital efficiency. We're going to continue for few more development plan and we got a great organization to do that. Derrick Whirfield : I agree, Travis, quite an impressive feat. As my follow up, perhaps for you Mike, as you think about and compare your D&C costs between the Midland and Delaware Basins. Where do you see the greatest room for improvement in your Delaware costs? Mike Hollis : Yes, Derrick, you nailed it. The Delaware is where we're kind of the baseball reference. We're probably in inning three to four. Midland, we're probably inning five and getting six. So Midland, we're picking up dimes in quarters. Delaware, as you saw, we had 16% reduction in our dollar per foot. So that's where we're seeing the biggest change and optimization rate. But going forward, the organization is not going to -- and the great thing is everything that we're learning, and doing, and changing in Midland, is applicable in Delaware and vice versa. So those two teams are fully integrated as well.So again, across the board, we'll continue to see efficiencies get worked into the system. And as Travis said, there is also some tailwinds with commodity -- where the commodity price sits, where activity sits. We're seeing some softening on the service side as well. So all of those things together, I think you're going to have some good things coming in next couple of quarters. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your may proceed with your question. Gail Nicholson : I really had a housekeeping question. Can you talk about the next step for you guys to achieve investment grade status and the potential timing of that? Mike Hollis : Gail, we're having active dialogue with the rating agencies. I think with us being over 280,000 barrels a day this business qualifies as an investment grade company. Our debt certainly trades like its investment grade company. We just need an upgrade from, either S&P and Moody's so upgraded us both. After the acquisition, we've executed on everything we said we're going to do post acquisition. And I think this business is on its way to becoming investment grade company whether or not the ratings get there or not. Gail Nicholson : Thank you... Mike Hollis : Gail, we also added the fall away provisions to our credit facility in the early spring, and that results in our credit facility becoming unsecured once one other agency upgrades us, including our Fitch rating today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Drew Venker with Morgan Stanley. Your may proceed with your question. Drew Venker : Travis, in the past you talked about using some of your free cash flow to replenish inventory. I think you've really talked down corporate M&A a lot obviously since the market over the last few months. But just interested to hear if the asset market is open, if maybe bid/ask is too wide here. But if you can pick up acreage at attractive prices? Travis Stice : Well, I think you've always heard us say that we'll do accretive deals. But there is a reason in my prepared remarks I said that I think the best M&A opportunity for us right now is repurchasing Diamondback share. And so that's really the corporate focus. But we do have an obligation to look for deals, but they've got to be massively accretive. And like I said just to reiterate, our focus is on repurchasing our own shares right now. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Rezvan with Oppenheimer. You may proceed with your question. Tim Rezvan : I had a question on unit expenses in 2Q. We saw gathering and transportation LOE, both reverse course after some pretty big declines. Can you talk about anything one-off that happened maybe in 2Q, or how we should thinking about more normalized trend going forward on those cash OpEx items? Travis Stice : So in the quarter, we have the full effect of the Central Basin platform. That acreage was closed on July 1st. So our LOE should trend down here in Q3 and Q4. We've been hinting towards the upper half of our 4.25 to 4.75 guidance for the rest of the year on LOE. Gathering, processing and transportation, that moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. I still think the midpoint is a good number there. Tim Rezvan : And then if I could ask a question related to Slide 15 on your CapEx to cash flow reconciliation, just want to make sure I understand this correctly. It appears that your updated guidance implies, or on track with your first half of '19, cost level of 890 per foot. And I'm just wondering is it fair to say that your updated guide is not reflecting any incremental efficiencies in the back half of the year? Travis Stice : Tim, I mean, we don't make promises on service costs. Efficiency wise the business is running as efficiently as possible. Certainly, there's some tailwinds on the service sector. But we certainly felt that this quarter was not the quarter to go, too aggressive on the guidance change. And we have expectations to continue to drive capital costs out of the business and meet or exceed these numbers there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. You may proceed with your question. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow up on a couple of earlier things, the $750 million in free cash flow in 2020 that you've talked about. What CapEx -- rough CapEx budget does that assume? And does it imply a modest acceleration from second half '19 levels, or a continuation of current activity? Travis Stice : If anything, it would a very, very moderate increase versus current activity levels. We're running 8 frac spreads today. We will run 8 frac spreads all year. And we're going to exit year running 8 frac spreads. We don't anticipate having any frac holidays at the end of the year. We're going to have 2019 running 8 spreads and probably enter 2020 running those 8 spreads. So I think for us now the questions are at the margin, right? We are completing 300 and 320 wells this year. I don't expect a material change from that number to the upside or the downside pending a major commodity price change. Ryan Todd : And then you reduced debt a little bit in the quarter and obviously, you are in a strong financial position. But at a high level, what do you think is the right level of debt for your company? Is it a conservative leverage metric at $750 a barrel oil price? Should we expect further debt reduction going forward? Or do you feel like you're in a pretty good place? Travis Stice : Ryan, I feel really good about how much debt we've reduced over the last couple of quarters. I really, on an absolute basis but also on a leverage metric basis, I feel like we're in really good shape. Right now, with the amount of cash proceeds that we have and the free cash flow profile of business, buying back our stock at these depressed levels is probably a better level use of capital for us, while still maintaining a fortress balance sheet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Asit Sen with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning guys. So on Slide12, you mentioned additional potential savings from infrastructure efficiency attributable to Rattler Midstream. Can you elaborate on that specifically? Mike Hollis : So these numbers that you see, the 735 in the Midland Basin and the 1,131 in the Delaware Basin are gross numbers. The benefit that we have of Rattler is that we do capitalize the first six months of water production in both basins, that's part of our [equip], the EPs of our [indiscernible] DC&E. Rattler's margins we're saving probably an extra $30 a foot on the Midland side and close to $75 or $80 a foot on the Delaware side. Asit Sen : And Mike, in the operational update, it was mentioned that you completed a pair of Jo Mill wells this quarter. Can you provide more details on the zone across your footprint, and how that you intent to layer in these completions, going forward? Mike Hollis : Northern and Midland Basin is the area that we're focusing on right now. So, we'll typically stagger Middle Spraberry with Jo Mill, the two that we did this quarter, we're drilling more this quarter as we're going forward. So as we do our -- keep development across the entire Northern Midland Basin, we're adding Middle Spraberry Jo Mill into those tubes. And so as far as that going forward that's what we're planning to do, the wells are performing and competing for capital with all of our other zones as we have today and look forward to doing that more, going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Jeff Grampp : I was curious at just -- it seemed like this quarter there was a little bit larger discrepancy and some pass in terms of drill versus complete. So I was just wondering if that was the expected plan for the quarter, if that's just a timing issue. Or how we should think about drill versus complete in the back half of the year? Mike Hollis : Jeff, you'll see that we drilled about 170 wells year-to-date and we completed 150. We're planning on completing somewhere around the midpoint of our guide at 300 to 320 wells. So our rig count has got a little bit ahead of our completion count, our completion cadence. So we probably -- you'd probably see us drop a couple of rigs into the back half of the year. But there'll be no change to the completion cadence with us running eight spreads consistently for the rest of the year. Jeffrey Grampp : And for my follow up, Travis, you mentioned buybacks being most interesting use of free cash flow right now. So just wondering as we look into 2020, you guys starting to build a track record of building the dividend that's having some growth there. So just wondering should we still assume that growing that annual dividend is still going to take precedence over accelerating buybacks, or how you guys look to balance the two while understanding that both of those are goals for your guys? Travis Stice : Again, it's not an either or and I think you've heard us say consistently that the board feels that the dividend is the primary form of shareholder return. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. David Deckelbaum : Just wanted to ask couple of questions on as we go in the 2020, you basically hit all the goals that you wanted to in '19, and this is a pretty busy year for you guys on the corporate side with the Rattler IPO, but then on the dropdown. As we go into '20, should we be thinking that this is start being, for lack of a better word, a more boring execution model? Or should we still be looking for things like drill-cos and other things that you've endeavored in the past to pull some value forward? I guess how do you square those with some of your ambitions of being this free cash growth engine? Travis Stice : David, if 2020 is going to a boring year for Diamondback that would be the first boring year in our company's history. So if the past is a prediction of the future, I expect a lot of exciting things to happen for Diamondback on that. I don't know what those are yet. But I know as we continue to demonstrate the free cash flow, and we've seen that we built and our execution and capital efficiency, the better need -- by us out here in the Permian, I think there's going to be opportunities. I don't know what those are going to be. But we know as long as we execute and this organization continues to deliver, we're going to have opportunities and it's up to us and management and Board to assess those opportunities and determine which one creates the most values for the shareholders who own the company. So don't know what those are going to be, but I suspect there will be something. David Deckelbaum : I guess like just on the completion side, and you highlighted costs perhaps coming down in the service side in the back half. Are you looking at other applications like some of the e-fracsand things that we see maybe more headline oriented these days. But are you looking at those with any sincerity at this point going into next year? Travis Stice : David, absolutely. So the answer is going to be, yes. Every new technology or application that we can vet and make sure that we're going to save money on the dollar per foot, and not hurt any efficiency and the production of the well. So e-frac, we have an e-frac crew coming in the latter half of this year. We will utilize dual field capability on several of our frac fleets and drilling rigs. Again, we are always looking at what's out there. We're watching what everyone else is doing well. So we will be typically a very, very fast follower, a lot of times we won't be on the exact leading edge. But there's again, we don't want to put our shareholders at risk for that.But at the end of the day, yes, that dollar per foot and the efficiency and capital efficiency is what we're looking for. So the great thing is, as we are slowing down as an industry, a lot of these things are coming available that have been working for other folks and now they are available and we'll take them up. So we're getting some of these crews that are coming in hot, and probably doing the same thing with rigs. We have got to complete the different rig fleet today than we had a year ago. And I think you are seeing some of the capital efficiency metrics same because of what we are doing now. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. You may proceed with your question. Rich Tullis : Travis or Mike, it seems like the rigs have been split fairly evenly between the Midland and Delaware Basins the past couple of quarters. Do you see that split holding fairly evenly into 2020? Or how do you look at the allocation of capital as we get a little bit closer to next year? Travis Stice : We take a look at that almost on every well decision. But I think just for planning purposes, I think jsut assuming that you're going to have an acreage split with rigs on either side of the basin is a good planning assumption. Rich Tullis : And just lastly, I know it's not a big part of your story, but the limelight area, looks like you're planning a rig there -- excuse me, a well there for the third quarter. With success, how active could that area become in 2020 for Diamondback? Travis Stice : If that area is successful, it will probably -- may just compete for capital. And the footprint we have there is good for one to two rigs probably, and we'll just -- it'd be good for Rattler as well too. So we'll just -- we'll wait until we get some data there and then make some capital decision. But it could be a nice place to partner rig for multiple years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. You may proceed with your questions. Jason Wangler : I just had one, and Mike you kind of hit on the services side. I mean as far as the pricing of services, I mean how much more do you think there is to really get given that's been pretty beat up obviously. And also, I guess you probably switch a lot of rigs. But do you see much more on the upgrading, whether it's on push your crews or rigs left as you move forward? Mike Hollis : Jason, again, these guys on the service side have been squeezed pretty hard. Again, it's in their wagon up to someone that's going to be very consistent in a fluid commodity price environment provides them with both an operational and a financial hedge. So we're getting some benefit there as well as the size and sales. So, us being able to stay steady is really helping those gas out as well. Don't see a whole lot of softening just because again we want our partners to be there at the end of the day, and we needed them and they're very big part of the success we've had. So we're working with those folks and they work with us on a high end of commodity price. We work with them on the low end of commodity price. But no, it is softening a little bit just because the activity levels dropping so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. You may proceed with your question. Michael Hall : I guess just quick one on my end, a lot have been addressed. As you think about the size and scale of repurchase program. Should we think about the free cash flow as the cap on that? Or given some of the asset sales and the liquidity you have. Should we anticipate seeing potentially even higher amounts of repurchases relatively to the free cash flow you're talking about? Mike Hollis : I think through 2019, the rest of 2019, we're going to use a mix of free cash flow profile and proceeds from the asset sales to continue to buyback program. As you move into 2020, I'd say free cash flow becomes more of the big governor at that point. We've completed all these onetime proceeds, the stocks still, in our opinion, very cheap and we're continuing to use our capital to buy back shares in this market. Michael Hall : And then I guess just coming back a little bit on the whole growth versus free cash flow question. How the big picture approach the optimization as you think about 2020 and beyond, but the optimization of growth versus free cash flow in the capital allocation decision? I'm just curious kind of more about your process as opposed to the outcome. Mike Hollis : I think it's a process which done at the margin for us now. I mean, we are a company that maximized growth with any cash flow for the last four years. So growing the cash flow is not a new concept to us. The big changes that we can grow and deliver free cash flow, and we have no intention of slowing that growth to maximize free cash flow or vice versa. It's going to be a symbiotic relationship for a long time. We are going to keep rolling, maybe it's at a rig or keep the same rig count as this year, doing more with the same capital and growth is the output next year with free cash flow also being the output. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Scott Hanold : Just couple quick ones. One, I first want to commend you all from obviously stepping up and buying back stock and hopefully, we'll see more by you all and the rest of the industry, especially with where some of these equities are trading. But maybe this one is for Kaes, as you all think about the buybacks here over the next quarter or two. Is there, you know, in your conversations with the rating agencies. Is there any push back from them to investment grade with the amount of buybacks you are doing? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, I mean, I haven't seen a lot of pushback. I think a lot of the one-time proceeds that we've received already about $1 billion were the one time proceeds, they're all seem as very credit positive. So we've checked those boxes and we've also checked the production box and checked the capital efficiency box. So I haven't had a lot of pushback on that front. And for us right now, investment grade is a corporate objective but for us buying back stock at depressed values is a more significant corporate objective. Scott Hanold : And a quick second one is on your ownership of VNOM, obviously, you guys strategically took more equity in that ownership with all recent drops. Can you give us a big picture view of your thoughts behind that investment here going forward? And where you all want to shake out with that ownership overtime? Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, I'm excited that Diamondback now owns pro forma for the drop back up to 60% of VNOM. I think it's a great relationship between the two, the relationship between Diamondback and Viper, certainly differentiates Viper's multiple and allows both companies to do smart deals like the deal that we announced last week. Diamondback has not sold one share of Viper over the past four years. And in fact, we've increased our ownership, so via share count. So we're happy with that ownership. We get a significant dividend at the Diamondback level from Viper on an annual basis and that relationship will continue to be very strong. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. You may proceed with your question. Leo Mariani : Just a question on the marketing side here, so I think you guys said that you will be at 95% or little bit better on oil price realizations in the second half of this year versus WTI. Just trying to get a sense, is it maybe a little bit lower in the third quarter or kind of a big boost comes in the fourth quarter. Can you give us any differentiation between 3Q and 4Q on that? Travis Stice : Yes, I think there will be some -- I think third quarter is close to that 95% range and Q4 pops up a little bit. I'll use this as a point that we've now secured take away for all of major production across the company when we had zero takeaway a year ago, certainly got through the worst of our wide differential quarters. And on a go forward basis, we're going to be selling all of our crude either across the dock in Corpus where we have reserved dock space or to a refinery in Houston. So we're pretty excited about where our marketing position is heading on, on the oil side. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's great. And I guess could you comment all on any initiatives on the gas, or NGL side. Obviously, it was a rough quarter in second quarter for gas price realizations. Are you guys working on anything maybe to get that gap out of basin to other markets, going forward? Travis Stice : Yes, we have very few taking [time rides] across our position. I think we do have some taking [time rides] from the Delaware that we're going to exercise, and get some different pricing exposure. But our Midland Basin and Northern Delaware gas production, we're going to look to hedge and protect ourselves that way. I think for us with gas being such a small percentage of our production and revenue, we're more focused on hedging that price at a decent realized price and not having to deal with the negative realizations we've had to deal with this quarter. Leo Mariani : And I guess just on the well cost side, obviously, you guys did a tremendous job of reductions here post the Energen deal. I know it's kind of hard of course to sort of project forward. But you certainly discussed at length your relentless focus on efficiencies here. I mean would you guys potentially foresee the absence of any changes in service costs. I mean, could we be sitting here a year from today and be talking about another 5% to 10% reduction in well costs? Travis Stice : Leo, Mike's guys are obviously the best in the business and that's why we hammered this cost discussion so hard in this deck. I see a lot of notes out about six month fumes and IPs across the basin, no one is talking about what these wells cost to get out of the ground. I mean, the cost structure that we have differentiates us into someone that can grow and return free cash versus someone who outspend cash flow. That's how important those differences are. So I expect Mike and his team to continue to drive costs out of the business. We certainly have some service cost tailwinds hitting us right now, and those should continue into 2020. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Brian Singer : Can you talk to how you see the rates of return in the Midland Basin versus the Delaware Basin I realize you kind of haven't given split in terms of activity. But just how you see those rates return comparing? And then post the cost reductions, you've highlighted how the Energen locations in the Delaware compare relative to legacy down back locations? Travis Stice : I'll tell you the locations in the Vermejo area, that's the best block in our portfolio, and we got -- that was the ground jewel in the Energen acquisition, and those wells are just simply spectacular. And so the rates of return there obviously are the best in any of our portfolio. I still think, Brian, that when you -- just out of the basin, it cost you more in the Delaware but you get it out faster and you got higher AUR per foot. The Midland Basin, you don't quite get as much hydrocarbon recovery, but it's lot cheaper.So as we look at it, this parts we still sort of think about it in an equal allocation in terms of rates of return. And you can see that how we spend our capital dollars there with rigs about equally on either side of the basin. So it's not precise number but we still think is roughly equivalent. Brian Singer : And then the follow up is with the regards to just how you're thinking about the range of options in 2020, particularly share repurchase and the extent of that relative -- and investing in that relative to investing for growth and how up cycles or down cycles in commodity prices would play a role? Mike Hollis : Brian, I think it's somewhere around what our budget was this year, either plus the rig or minus the rig absent a very negative commodity take between now and end of the year. So we are very focused on at least hitting that $750 million of free cash at $55 WTI next year. If WTI is lower than that, we will have to look at where service costs are and where our wells cost are, and see what free cash flow comes out of the model. But like I said earlier, there is not a huge delta between our current thinking and where we are in our current pace and where we are going to be in 2020, which allows this business to grow significantly, but also buyback a lot of stock. And if the stock remains depressed, we will continue to buy back stock with free cash flow and our one time proceeds that we have executed on this last quarter. Operator : Thank you. And I am and not showing at any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for any further remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks again everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the call. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Annie. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's third quarter 2019 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are : Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO.During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. Normally, I'll jump right in and review key milestones in the quarter, but with the challenging market conditions, I feel the need to reflect on where we are today.Investor sentiment towards energy remains decidedly negative even in the face of commodity prices performing fairly well this year. The US rig count is now down over 25% year-over-year. And we expect that downward trajectory to continue with frozen capital markets, tighter lending conditions and the search for free cash flow sector wide. As a result of these conditions, we expect continued pressure on US production growth numbers and expectations for 2020 US production growth need to recalibrate lower, all of which may potentially support oil prices pending demand growth.We believe these market conditions call for a 2020 investment framework that's focused on flat-to-down capital spending, an efficient low cost structure and returns on capital in excess of cost of capital, all of which are strategies Diamondback has been focused on for many years and plan to address with our 2020 plan presented today.Late last year, we laid out our plans for the upcoming 2019 year. There was tremendous concern surrounding Diamondback's ability to integrate the Energen acquisition and deliver on acquisition strategies. The fundamental question was whether we could maintain our industry-leading cost structure and capital efficiency on a company with twice the scale and double the people. We also spoke of the significant shift to consistently returning capital to shareholders while continuing to grow production, and we set ambitious targets for production growth and execution on operational efficiencies.Since then, we've exceeded our own expectations of synergies realized from the Energen transaction, delivering on every synergy ahead of schedule and add a greater value to our shareholders even creating a synergy scorecard updated quarterly since the transaction closed to transparently document our progress. We have successfully taken our midstream entity, Rattler, public, raising over $700 million in proceeds and creating a high-margin high-growth midstream subsidiary. We have dropped down mineral assets from Diamondback and Energen to Viper, increasing Viper's exposure to Diamondback while receiving cash and stock in consideration. We've executed on our grow-and-prune strategy by divesting legacy Energen conventional properties for gross proceeds of $285 million. We have realized and continue to realize operational efficiencies with average well cost today over 15% lower than Diamondback's cost prior to the Energen acquisition, leading industry in efficiency measures such as recycle ratio and demonstrating the strength of Diamondback's execution machine.We've accomplished a remarkable set of corporate objectives while still delivering on execution and cost measures. These are the things I reflect on considering Diamondback's performance during 2019.Our business is complex. In this quarter we had a number of anomalous events that caused several of the metrics we follow and/or held accountable for to underperform our expectations. We understand that the market monitors performance on a quarterly basis, which is why we have been as transparent as possible as to the impact of these events and our path forward.But let me be clear, none of this performance requires a course correction or change in strategy at Diamondback. After growing significantly for the first two quarters of the year, Diamondback's oil production declined in the third quarter due to the sale of 5,800 barrels per day of low margin oil from our Central Basin platform assets effective July 1, 2019.Without considering this effect, Diamondback's quarterly production grew, but the oil production declined. The completion of 18 wells in our Vermejo area in Reeves County and 14 wells in Glasscock County, five of which were DUCs completed or drilled rather prior to the closing of the Energen merger, drove oil cut down since these two areas begin production with oil cuts below 65%.These 32 wells made up over 35% of total gross wells completed in the third quarter versus 12% of the wells completed in the first half of the year and 15% of the wells that will be completed in the fourth quarter.While we are accountable for forecasting our production, the impact from offset completions were dramatic during the quarter another strong reminder while we did not provide quarterly guidance. Specifically in Howard County, one of our most active and highest oil cut fields, the combination of Diamondback frac activity and offset operators both to the east and west of our leasehold cut production in half or over 20,000 gross barrels of oil per day during portions of the quarter.While we'll plan to model this impact more conservatively going forward, we expect frac impacts to continue to be significant primarily in the Midland Basin with operators in full field multi-well pad development mode. Taking all of this into consideration along with current production levels, we expect fourth quarter 2019 oil production to grow over 3% from the third quarter but offset frac impact is still expected to be large in the fourth quarter particularly in Howard County where there's significant rig and completion activity due to the economics of the area.Looking ahead to 2020, our goal in putting together our capital plan was to maximize oil weighted production growth within a similar budget framework as 2019, getting more with less. As a result, we expect to grow oil production 10% to 15% year-over-year and complete over 10% more net lateral footage than 2019.Most importantly, our budget assumes we cover our budget and base dividend above $45 oil and have over $675 million of pre-dividend free cash flow at $55 oil. Our 2020 commodity price assumptions have weakened since our last communication around 2020 free cash flow, which now assumes $13 per barrel NGLs, down almost 40% from May and $1.50 realized gas prices.Regardless of the commodity price assumptions, we are committed to offering an industry-leading combination of growth and free cash flow yield in 2020. We believe this capital operating plan reflects the optimal capital efficiency for achieving differential growth and significant free cash flow in 2020. Should commodity prices decline, we will be prepared to act responsibly and cut capital further, just like we've done multiple times in the past. If commodity prices rally, we plan to use excess free cash flow to accelerate our capital return program and reduce debt.The biggest concern related to the miss we experienced versus internal and street expectations in the third quarter and as a result, 2019 full year oil production are; one, how can we be confident the oil production miss in the third quarter is not the start of a continuing trend. And two, how are the lessons learned from the third quarter accounted for in the forward guidance. Well, first, when there's a miss of the magnitude that we just experienced in the third quarter, we have to fundamentally reexamine the assumptions that led to this performance. We've done this and as a result, we've more conservatively modeled our expectations for the future, particularly external issues that are out of our control, such as offset operator frac hits like those experienced in the third quarter.Full field development by Midland Basin operators, including Diamondback, increased the amount of production water down on average throughout the course of the year, which was not modeled conservatively enough in 2019. These are operational challenges, not reservoir problems. Second, we have increased the amount of co-development zones across more productive zones, which we began in 2019 and we expect to increase that in 2020, particularly in the Midland Basin. While this strategy is expected to maximize the net present value and extends inventory life, in some areas, this capital allocation decision generates lower first year oil production per developed pad.Our Midland Basin development plan prior to 2019 was predominantly focused on the Wolfcamp A and the Lower Spraberry. In 2019 and carrying into 2020, we're increasing our exposure to other zones such as the Jo Mill, Middle Spraberry and Wolfcamp B due to the improved well performance in these particular zones, and the estimated net present value benefit of this co-development. This holds true to a lesser extent for the Delaware Basin as well, where we have more Second and Third Bone Spring development plan, along with our primary development zone in the Wolfcamp A.Again, this is a well mix issue, not a reservoir problem. Lastly, on a percentage basis, we're adding fewer new drill, high flush volume wells and high oil cut wells to the 2020 production mix than in previous years, which also lowers the corporate oil mix. You can see in our 2020 guide that we're now guiding to oil-only to address this confusion. While these changes in modeling assumptions and development strategy translate to an overall lower 2020 oil production expectation relative to consensus, our 2020 capital efficiency will be slightly better than in 2019 due to execution improvements and lower cost structure as measured by drilling capital spend per barrel of oil production added after taking into account our over 36% oil based decline rate in 2020. Our current capital forecast for 2020 incorporates today's service costs, which should decline from here pending a reduction in expected basin wide activity levels.As a result of all the data presented here, I'm reiterating that this is not an inflection point or a course correction and the value proposition for Diamondback remains unchanged. Comfortable double-digit oil growth, a mid single-digit free cash flow yield and the lowest cost structure in the business. Today Diamondback is poised to grow production at the highest margin and capital efficiency in the industry, while maintaining a strong capital structure and activity and actively returning cash to shareholders.With these comments complete, operator please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann. [SunTrust Robinson Humphrey] Your line is open. Travis Stice : Good morning, Neal. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Your 2020 oil and total production guidance suggests about 10% to 15% growth in that $19 million midpoint while still generating what I would assume around 5% free cash flow yield. My question is could you speak to some of the assumptions around the guide, you kind of hit on these specifically, how you risk this and then the assumed number of rigs and spreads and potential OFS and all those costs baked in there? Travis Stice : Yeah. So I'll answer in reverse. The OFS costs, we just baked in what we actually saw in the third quarter. So again as activity level continues to slow down out here in the Permian, we expect to continue to see service cost reductions and actually is going to provide a tailwind for our free cash flow generation next year.I think specifically the risking that we took on frac hits was more aggressively modeled this year than we did in 2019. And what that means is that you actually end up with a more severe hit across more wells that last longer.But also when you look at the things that impacted the third quarter and how that adjusted some of our assumptions on a go-forward basis even down to the details of like how long it takes for a well to recover once it's been watered out. And we've extended that time. When the co-development of some of the zones we've talked about, we've extended the time-to-peak production in order to also reflect kind of what we've seen in the third quarter.But look when you have a miss of the magnitude that we did in the third quarter, you really have to like I said in my prepared remarks re-examine every single thing we've done. And we - every single assumption that was made and we've done that. I mean, we're down to - we're looking at the daily increase in your hertz rate on sub-pumps after frac.We've really broke the business down into a fundamental part. So I think when you stub your toe like we did in the third quarter, you've got to be able to adjust your future forecast to make sure that that you can hit those numbers and we've done so with the assumption we put in place.I think the rig cadence and completion cadence, the low end of our guidance probably is going to reflect in order to \u2013 if we hit that low end, it will probably be a function of slowing down activity. And the high end of the guidance is probably a function of saving some money and maybe getting a couple of more wells drilled and completed during the year. Neal Dingmann : Got it. Got it. And then lastly, could you speak to Slide 6 in your deck, particularly the part up on top that you talked about and you get this a little bit in the prepared remarks about the increased co-development between zones in the Midland and Delaware. I mean, should we consider this a shift in overall strategy? And will this impact your M&A going forward? Travis Stice : I don't think there's any read-through to M&A. M&A is a function of a low-cost, high efficient operator acquiring assets that we can do more with under our execution and cost structure than others can. But it does reflect \u2013 it does reflect how we think about the future. We believe that these \u2013 we believe that these co-development is fundamentally the right thing to do and that's the way our strategy is laid out for the next several years. Neal Dingmann : Very good. Thanks for the details. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Travis Stice : Hey, Brian. Brian Singer : To follow-up on a couple of the comments you mentioned. First, can you add a little bit more color on the frac hit impact that you're forecasting for next year and how that relates relative to what you've seen this year? And then as well, you mentioned not a reservoir issue. So we see the impact when \u2013 on the negative side to production can you talk about what happens when that goes away, how the wells respond, how quickly they get back or if they get back to the production levels that they were at before the hit and how that leads to a declining or how that leads to an evolving decline rate in both basins? Travis Stice : Yes so specific, as we've done the forecasting in 2020, we've looked at each individual field. And so we've gone back and historically modeled the number of days of zero production of oil. And then once it starts returning oil, the number of days it takes to get back to peak production.And both of those two elements, the number of days that it produced zero plus the number of days that it takes to get back to peak production were extended in our forecast for 2020. And we've done that in each of the areas.Now, again, what we've seen is they do return to peak production. And so that's why I make the comment that it's not a reservoir issue because the EUR, the area and the curve remains unchanged. It's now the delivery of that EUR has been more conservatively modeled with respect to these brackets. Adam Lawlis : Yes. And I'd say Brian on top of that, we've been modeling brackets for a long time in Spanish Trail, in this case Q2 \u2013 or sorry Q3 was extraordinarily difficult in Howard County because of the size of the pads offset us, right? Traditionally, we've completed four well pads. So the east of us there's a 24-well pad completed and that frac spread was on-site for 2.5 months and so that's a significant hit even higher than what we originally expected. So that particular field, the Howard County field was hit by about 12,000 gross barrels of oil a day for the whole quarter, which on a net basis is about 8000 net barrels a day. Travis Stice : I'll just add to that Brian. When you look at what we've been doing in Spanish drill now for over five years, we've seen the impact of frac hits and are confident that because of that experience, we've seen full recovery. And it's not just the first time you hit it, some of these wells in Spanish Drill have been hit multiple times, but each time they returned back to their previous forecast. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And you partially answered this, in the earlier question, but if we think about that CapEx - if you think about the CapEx and the production range, and let's assume that the CapEx is at the midpoint of your guidance for 2020, is there a scenario or what would be the scenario where production would end up at the lower end of the range. And I think you kind of highlighted what the scenario would be at the higher end of the range. But essentially, if you're investing at the midpoint of your CapEx guidance, what do you see as the risk to both the downside and the upside to the oil production guidance that you put up? Travis Stice : Yes, certainly the things that impacted us in the third quarter, we believe we've addressed those more aggressively or more conservatively in the form of forward guidance to spend the same CapEx next year, or the midpoint of the CapEx and coming at the low point of the oil guide, then you've got to have something, you've got to have poor well performance that we're not expecting right now. And we've not guided that direction at all. As I said, the low end of the guide is more a function of lower total activity. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is open. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks. Good morning, all. Travis Stice : Hi. Good morning, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, as we look at the 2020 capital program, are there any quarters that have outsized activity in GlassCock and Vermejo next year? Travis Stice : Yes, I think the quarters, again, we've learned what we saw in the third quarter of this year. And so the guidance that we put in place reflects a more steady guide of Vermejo and GlassCock County wells on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And perhaps for my follow-up, referencing slide 7, your asset base is quite resilient at lower prices, assuming lower growth in 2020. How would this slide look for 2021 in terms of your cash flow breakeven? Travis Stice : Yes, Derrick, I mean, that's all dependent upon activity, right? I mean, at the same activity level, cash flow would still grow. In 2021, I don't think it would grow 11% to 15%, but you would still see growth. We feel like we have a lot of tailwinds going into next year, particularly 10% better realizations on the oil side for the year. We've got some LOE tailwinds where LOE is going to be declining throughout the year next year. So that all supports a lower breakeven as we continue to grow, but don't continue to spend every dollar we make back in the ground to fund that growth. Adam Lawlis : And Derrick, I just want to add, since you brought up slide 7. When you look at the $55 oil bar, it's a $675. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had originally communicated $750 million of free cash flow at $55 oil. But the deterioration of NGLs right now at $13 a barrel, we lost $7 a barrel relative to our last communication, and that's about $100 million worth of free cash flow that went away from us in that scenario. Derrick Whitfield : Great. Thanks for your time, guys. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Tim Rezvan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Tim Rezvan : Good morning, Folks. I had an organization question, which perhaps is best suited for Travis. In the last year, Diamondback's closed the Energen acquisition, they've ipo-ed another subsidiary and the organizations lost its COO in September.I know Diamondback is an organization that's prided itself on running lean when there's a laser focus on G&A. But I guess my question Travis is with your organization's complexity and that the Q3 miss that we saw last night is the organization too lean? Are you right sized to execute like you wanted to? And should investors be concerned about the complexity? Travis Stice : No. Complexity is part of our fundamental DNA. What looks complex to our investors, we intend to make look simple. And organizationally, I've said I think in the last earnings call, I said we we're probably 150 people short. And we're probably still somewhere around 100 people short. And that's across every aspect of our business. But I'm not going to stand here and say that the function of third quarter was a result of one either complexity; or two lack of people that we own it. And that's what you expect me to do is to staff the organization adequately and to simplify complexity and that's what I intend to do every day. Tim Rezvan : Okay, okay. But thanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up in your prepared comments, you talked about a well mix issue from more zones and your pad development. Can you talk about why year one oil goes down? Is that a controlled flow back issue? Or is it because of oil cuts in other zones. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Travis Stice : Yeah. No, the oil goes down on a year-over-year basis because when you add in a Jo Mill or a Middle Spraberry well into four-zone development, it has a different oil delivery type curve than does the Wolfcamp A or the Lower Spraberry, which we've historically had a heavier dose of those two development zones. So when you look at the oil relative for a four-zone where I've added in the Jo Mill and the Middle Spraberry, you see the corresponding impact. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Jeff Grampp. [Northland Securities] Your line is open. Jeff Grampp : Hi, guys. Travis Stice : Hi, good morning Jeff. Jeff Grampp : I was wondering, it looks like the Q3 Delaware well costs are already at the low end of your 2020 budgeted cost there. Just wondering, is that I guess a well mix consideration that maybe drove Q3 lower? Or do you think - is it fair to think that maybe there's some embedded conservatism in what you guys are assuming budget wise for 2020.? Adam Lawlis : Yeah, Jeff, Vermejo is the cheapest of the three fields in the Delaware Basin from a DC&E perspective. So we did have a lot of Vermejo wells come through in the third quarter, which is why that number looks low relative to the guide. But as Travis said, we're not guiding to service cost reductions from where we are today, we certainly expect to continue to see some deflation and continue to get some efficiencies. But for the third quarter relative to 2020 really that's more a higher percentage of Vermejo rolling through the capital side. Travis Stice : Yeah, listen as I prepared for this quarter, we go through our normal quarterly review process where we do a well-by-well analysis of wells that were contributed in the quarter. And I couldn't be more proud of the continued focus, laser-like focus of the operations organization on driving cost out and improving recovery. So that part of our DNA is spectacularly in place and it's something I'll monitor almost on a daily basis. Jeff Grampp : Got it. Understood. And thanks for those comments. Just for my follow-up just kind of a bigger picture question for you Travis. Can you talk about why 10% to 15% is the right growth for Diamondback in 2020 versus evaluating maybe trade-offs of slower growth and more free cash flow to fund the buyback and maybe dividend growth? And just kind of how you guys evaluated the potential trade-offs of those types of scenarios? Travis Stice : Yes, it's not a precise calculus granted but we had to balance is we're trying to and we believe we have presented a business model that has this kind of sustainable free cash flow on a go-forward basis. And so, if we had lower growth and greater cash flow in 2020 then you're going to impact the out years of your development plan.So what we believe we've done is struck was an appropriate balance of maintaining and sustaining the free cash flow generation that this machine is capable of but at the same time kind of at the upper end of anybody out there in terms of production growth. And listen, I still believe that Diamondback is the best executor and the lowest cost producer which should grow. And that's what we've presented in the 2020 guide. Jeff Grampp : All right. Understood and appreciate the trends prepared remarks Travis. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question from the line of Ryan Todd from Simmons Energy. Your line is open. Ryan Todd : Good, thanks. Maybe one more follow-up on the co-development strategy. Does the shift towards more co-development, do you have any impact in the way that you approach facility, design or construction or even on operating costs? Travis Stice : Yes, not really. I still expect facility cost and operating cost to decline year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter but that's part of my predisposition though but the co-development whether the \u2013 the only thing that could possibly impact that would be is if we added like in the Delaware a higher percentage of Second Bone, Third bone, Springs wells that have a higher water cut and we'll not have to adjust it. But we've accounted for all of that facilities design in our 2020 guide? Adam Lawlis : Yes Ryan pad size been changing, the mix of the wells within the pad is changing. So overall your facility size and spend is similar. Now in 2020, we do have more gas lift projects in our infrastructure budget. Those are one-time expenses that should roll through in 2020 and help LOE over the long term. Ryan Todd : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just a question on use of cash. I mean, you guys have a significant increase in free cash flow next year. In terms of use of free cash I know you get asked about this all the time. But can you talk about priorities for use of cash specifically like buybacks versus dividend growth? How do you look at the balance there? And have you ever entertained the idea at all of a variable distribution in excess of a base dividend rather than a buyback? Adam Lawlis : I think if you go back and look at the previous communications that we've had about what our primary form of return to shareholders is and that's in the form of an increasing dividend. And that's what we intended to do on a go-forward basis.The variable distribution something that's really not something we've considered. We don't want to overly complicate the business. There's not a lot that you can do with free cash flow. And we believe we've addressed each of those in the form of share buyback potential for \u2013 as we said, we're always going to increase the dividend on a go-forward basis and that's what we intend to do. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks, Travis. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Drew Venker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew Venker : Hi, everyone. Just one follow-up, one on the guidance for 2020, hoping you could give us a sense in very simple terms, how much downtime you're assuming of your base production for 2020? And if you can compare that to what had assumed for the original 2019 guidance? Travis Stice : Yes, Drew. I mean, traditionally, the base production we assume high single-digit downtime as a percentage of total, 6%, 7% downtime that number has stayed about the same for your base production. What we've risked is the additional production, right? So not only are you you're risking the new wells put online, but on top of that via the data we have, we shut in offset wells within a certain perimeter of the well getting completed ahead of time. So your traditional risking stays in place, but on top of that, you need to risk any well that's being watered out within a certain parameter or a certain diameter of the well that you're completing for a certain period of time. Drew Venker : Okay. But presumably, you could still have that watering out or shut-in impact from new wells on offset operators that would impact your base production or am I thinking about that incorrectly? Travis Stice : Yes, communication between us and offset operators is important. I think in the Midland Basin, particularly where we're all really close to each other, and there's not big fields, that's important. But we model that impact via some conservatism. And we also know where those guys are operating. We have a view into their six month frac schedules. We take that into account. I think what happened here is you had a larger pad on watering us out for a longer period of time than originally expected, and therefore, going forward in those fields where we have offset operators, we're very conservative on the water out piece there. Drew Venker : Okay. Travis Stice : I think just to wrap that up. I mean we've got the visibility; we believe we've got more data analytics-driven decisions data analytics now that can increase the predictabilities effect. And we've accounted for that in on our go-forward plan, probably more so in this year's plan than any plan we've previously submitted. Drew Venker : Understood. Thanks for that, Travis. I guess as you think about 2020 and the transition overall to, I think bigger projects on average, how do you think about the cadence of growth throughout 2020? Is there a pretty wide range of project sizes and timing that will affect the cadence out there? If you could just give some more color on that? Travis Stice : Yes, not too much, Drew. Project size isn't changing much. I'd say the type of wells within the project is changing, right? So Midland Basin, we still do 4, 5, 6 well pads, but there's more co-development between zones. And so from a production growth perspective, we are going to get back to growth in the fourth quarter and grow fairly consistently through the first half of 2020. And there's not a big lumpy quarter in that assessment. It's going to be consistent pop growth and production growth. Drew Venker : And then similar growth in the second half of the year, do you think is still consistent for 2020? Travis Stice : Yes. Drew Venker : Thanks. Operator : We have another question from the line of Asit Sen from Bank of America. Your line is open. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning. Thanks for the details on the frac that you provided to quantify in 3Q. Could you Kaes broadly quantify the impact of frac hits that you're assuming in the 3% sequential growth in 4Q? Travis Stice : Yeah, Asit traditionally, we model about 8% 10% of our total production being watered out at any given time. I think as you think about the fourth quarter, Howard County is coming back. Today that field's back up to 40,000 gross barrels a day from the bottom of 25, but you are watering out other areas such as Spanish trail and small stuff in Pecos. But on an overall basis, I'd say as a percentage of total production, our frac hit will be lower in Q4 than it was in Q3 and pretty consistent through 2020 especially as you get to full year development in the Midland Basin. Asit Sen : Okay, great. And then some of your peers have - are showing strong results in the third bone spring. Just wondering if you have any incremental thoughts on that zone and the number of completions you're planning to complete in the zone. I couldn't exactly figure it out on slide 6, but any rough estimation would be good? Travis Stice : Yeah, I think we're excited about it in the ReWard area and the Vermejo area. As you get into our Pecos County asset, we're more excited about the second bone spring and the third bone spring. So while we're not as excited about the second bone in ReWard and Vermejo that's where the third bone is prevalent. And then on the contrary in the Pecos area particularly on the eastern portion - or western portion of the Pecos area, the second bone is probably our secondary zone behind the Wolfcamp A. Asit Sen : Thanks a lot. Operator : We do have another question from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor Pickering Holt Company. Your line is open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few follow-ups on co-development. First one is as we look at the number of wells and zones like the Wolfcamp B, the Middle Spraberry and the Jo Mill, on the Midland side and the third bone, second bone, on the Delaware side as a percent of total wells for the next year, how is that percentage compared to 2019's mix? And how does that change as you look forward to 2021 and beyond? Travis Stice : Yeah, Jeff I'll take the Delaware first because it's less of an impact in 2019, let's say the Wolfcamp A was almost 90% of 2019 development in the Delaware Basin going to closer to 85% or so in 2020.In the Midland Basin the big move has actually happened in 2019 versus 2018, 2017. So if you take 2018 and 2017, we're probably closer to 65% to 70% Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry versus 2019 and 2020 closer to 50% or 55% in the Wolfcamp A and the Lower Spraberry. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Okay. And should we expect - just a quick follow-up to that. So we should expect that percentage to continue decreasing over time as you continue progressing on co-developments? Travis Stice : I don't think it will decrease. I think the shift has been made and we are getting what we believe to be all the economic zones at once in the Midland Basin. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. And then on these additional zones, can you just give more detail on how the early time productivity compares. Again as you look at the Wolfcamp B and the Middle Spraberry for example versus what you've historically seen in the lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A? Travis Stice : Yes. So very clearly, the Middle Spraberry takes longer to clean up. So you do have less production early time in the Middle Spraberry and the Jo Mill versus the Lower Spraberry. And between the Wolfcamp A and the Wolfcamp B, Wolfcamp A is just so strong. They have a similar production profile between the two Wolfcamp zones but where we are, the B is not as good as the A but still highly economic. So you have high early time production just not as high as what you see in the Wolfcamp A. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Thank you. Operator : We do have another question from the line of David Deckelbaum from Cowen. Your line is open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, Travis and Kaes. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Travis Stice : You bet, David. David Deckelbaum : I was hoping to get some color. You talked a lot about the 2020 guidance. You laid out that free cash projection of $675 million accounted for the lower NGL prices. Can you add more color on just the Carlyle JV the 15 to 17 wells being drilled. One where that development is taking place? And two, what you think the net cash benefit is going to be to Diamondback this year? Travis Stice : Yes David. So this is the first year where the Carlyle JV is a significant portion of our total well count, 16 wells about 5% of 2020 total well count, that's in the same Pedro ranch which is the Southeast corner of our Pecos County asset. Carlyle and Diamondback have elected to drill out the northern portion of that, the north half of that in 2020. We have to account for that at 100% of the production but also 100% of the capital. And we estimate that JV in 2020 actually produces $50 million more free cash flow. And then we're presenting on Slide 7. So we're putting up 15% of the capital for 20% of the production. And after certain return thresholds are met, we will control 85% of the production. David Deckelbaum : Okay. So that's helpful. The other question I had was just you all made a lot of headway this year in terms of LOE coming down. It sounds like you have some infrastructure investments that you're hoping will pay off to a similar effect in 2020. The margins that you're assuming I guess in that 2020 free cash guide. Is that just holding your current cost structure flat? Travis Stice : No. Dave I think we're going to see another couple of dimes of help here into the fourth quarter and into 2020 on the LOE side. So we're kind of modeling mid-4s for LOE going forward. But every cent counts $0.01 is $1 million of free cash. So there's certainly some benefits and some tailwinds we'll see even into 2021 as we get some permanent infrastructure in place. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate the color, guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, David. Operator : We have another question from the line of Jason Wangler from Imperial Capital. Your line is open. Jason Wangler : Good morning, guys. Just had one question. As you think about the free cash flow you talked about 2020. Where does reducing the debt on the credit facility kind of come into that equation? Is that something more that you look at asset sales and savings? Or is that something that's kind of normal course of business alongside the other initiatives. Travis Stice : Yes, Jason, we feel like we've got the revolver to a point where we're comfortable. We have a significant borrowing base behind it. We haven't even added the Energen properties, which had a borrowing base of $3 billion, so pro forma borrowing base is closer to $5.5 billion.We're trying to run its company like an investment-grade company and we hope that time comes. And at that point, we would reduce our revolver borrowings to zero and term out our debt. But from an absolute basis, other things to be at the margin certainly, but we feel really comfortable about our growth profile and what our absolute leverage and leverage metrics look like. Jason Wangler : I appreciate it. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Our question from the line of Betty Jiang from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Betty Jiang : Thank you. Good morning. I appreciate your comments earlier about showing steady production growth cadence through 2020. I was wondering if you could give us some type of range on where oil production could be in the Q4, 2020. Travis Stice : Yeah, Betty. I'm hoping we exit the year in the mid to high teens exit-to-exit versus Q4 2019. Betty Jiang : Got it. And then, the Q4, 2019, level will be sort of in the low 190s. So that will put us in \u2013 probably close to mid, 220s for Q4? Travis Stice : Yeah. I mean, I think, we tried to very accurately describe what we think Q4, 2019, is going to look like and a growth rate on top of that. Betty Jiang : Great. Thank you for that. And then, follow-up is on the sort of buyback, how are you guys thinking about peso buyback going forward, would it more likely follow the quarterly free cash flow cadence through the year? Or would it be pretty opportunistic, depending on price actions? Travis Stice : Yeah. Primarily it will be based on free cash flow and being revolver neutral. I certainly think, we have an opportunity here to be a little more aggressive in the near term. But over the long term, it's focused on buying back stock within the free cash flow framework. Betty Jiang : Got it. Makes sense. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Betty. Operator : We have another question from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is open. Richard Tullis : Thanks. Good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Rich. Richard Tullis : Travis, when you look at the oil mix projected for 2020, I guess, it's down a couple of percent from where you were, say, in the first half of this year. How do you see the oil mix trending over the next several years assuming no additional acquisitions? Does it move closer to the 1P reserve number? Travis Stice : Yeah. Ultimately, we'll move closer to the 1P number. But for the next couple of years, I think, what we've got modeled at this kind of activity pace and that balance of kind of growth and yield you'll - I think, you'll see more of a steady oil cut on a go-forward years. Adam Lawlis : On a yearly basis. Travis Stice : On a yearly basis. Yeah. Richard Tullis : Okay. Thank you. And just lastly, shifting over to the line like prospect, it sounds like you had some appraisal drilling in the past quarter. What are your thoughts on what you saw there? And how many wells might be planned for 2020? Travis Stice : Yeah. We certainly - we didn't disclose any results this quarter, but we like what we saw and we've got another appraisal well I think planned back half of this year, or back half of next year. Richard Tullis : Okay. All right. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : We have another question from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is open. Charles Meade : Good morning. Travis, you and your team, you guys have covered a lot of ground already this morning. I think, I have just a couple of quick ones. First one, on the Vermejo area, I understand that that's a relatively a guess here, but I think it's also my understanding that that's one of your - or at least has been one of your best most attractive areas at the top of the portfolio. Is that still the case? Or has there been anything- Travis Stice : Still the case. Charles Meade : Okay. Thank you. And then second this is maybe a bigger picture question Travis about the service environment. You and a lot of other operators are talking about a service - deflation in service costs. But from the outside looking in and certainly you see this with their stock prices that looks like a sick business model that's not doing very well.So, did you guys ever - do you guys spend any time thinking or talking about the viability of this - your service partners? And is that something that you have anything you'd want to share your thoughts on? Travis Stice : Yes, look we need that sector to perform well. They are business partners and they're vitally important to us prosecuting our development plan on a go-forward basis. I believe that the headwinds the upstream E&P guys are facing are also being applied to the service sector. But I don't concern myself with viability as much as I do maybe availability.There could be some elements of the OFS sector that gets put under more harsh pressure than some of the big guys. And that's why we try to be open and transparent with our service sector business partners is to make sure that they understand our plans and we understand their plans. Charles Meade : Thanks Travis. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks Charles. Operator : We have another question from the line of Biju Perincheril from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Biju Perincheril : Hi thanks. Good morning. Travis just when looking at the frac hits and impact, when you look at how quickly those wells can recover, what - is there a relationship between the vintage of that well the producing well on the formations? And how should we think about that? Travis Stice : No, I don't think vintage is the relevant indicator. It's just proximity. So, if you're within a certain amount of lateral feet from that particular well, we shut in the well we're producing early and then it comes back five to 10 days after the frac job is complete. Adam Lawlis : Yes, we've got wells - I think I mentioned earlier, we've got wells in Spanish Trail that have been what - frac hit five or six times over the last five or six years. And as we go through into down with our reserve auditors, you see the frac hit and then you see the recovery back to the former decline rates. So, having to do the vintage, it just really has to do with the proximity of where the offending waters being injected in the frac operations. Biju Perincheril : Got it. And then just going back to the other question on the oil mix. So, if you're in that maintenance mode that you've referenced in the press release, the $1.7 billion CapEx scenario. Not that's what you're doing, but if that's the case sort of we better understand the impact on fresh wells coming on, where could the oil mix line out? Adam Lawlis : Yes. So, oil decline - base decline is 36%, 37% next year. BOE base decline is 33%. So, you will see a little bit of a lower oil percentage if you went into maintenance mode or if you went into full decline. If you went into a maintenance mode, we kind of estimate you lose from an oil percentage perspective 1% 1.5%. Biju Perincheril : Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Biju. Operator : We have another question from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Scott Hanold : Thanks, appreciate it. Real quickly. Just to go back to the frac hits in the Howard County area. When you step back and look at how you plan for it in third quarter, was there any kind of miscommunication between you and the non-op that was fracking close to you? Or was it just the amount of time it took for those wells to get online that was the delta? Travis Stice : Yeah. They fracked, I think 24 wells, it took 2.5 months to get out 24 wells completed. And I don't know if they had operational issues or not, but that was a long time to be pumping water in the ground immediately adjacent to some of our best oil producers in the country. Scott Hanold : Yes. So I guess to my - the point I was trying to get to is, is there constant communication between you all when they're going to be close to you? Or how does that operationally work when they're going to be fracking close to you and keeping in touch with them to understand where they're at and issues that they're having? Travis Stice : Yeah across the basin, we have good communications with all the operators, and specifically again in Howard County is - those - that big pad that was developed was physically adjacent to the lease line. And so as they continue their development scenarios, they're moving further to the east more away from our good producers. So we think that - again we think we've got models more conservative on a go-forward basis and maintain good communication with all of our offset operators because we do the same to them. So we treat them like we want to be treated. Scott Hanold : Okay. That's good to hear. And my follow-up is you mentioned in the press release talking about the - how the mix of oil has changed prior - since the closing of the Energen merger. Has - anything with the GoR with the Energen assets? Is that any different than what you would have expected at this point in time? Travis Stice : No. It's just - it's what we've expected. Scott Hanold : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have another question from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Leo Mariani : Yeah, hi guys. I don't want to beat a dead horse on the issue here of third quarter, kind of, offset brackets and shut-ins. But I was hoping to look at it slightly differently. Would you guys be able to quantify what you think you lost on production in third quarter relative to two quarter? Was this like a two or three time\u2019s standard deviation event versus what you normally would have seen in the prior few quarters? Travis Stice : Yeah, I'd say the two times standard deviation of that. We traditionally model out good amount, 10% or so of gross production watered out and this was closer to 15% to 20% for the quarter. I estimate that it's probably an additional 4,000, 5,000 net oil barrels than what was expected going into the quarter. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's helpful. And just moving over to co-development. Obviously, you guys talked about doing more zones that maybe you had in past years here in 2019. Maybe just philosophically, can you talk about how you think about that from a returns perspective? Do you think that that kind of hurt your returns a little bit, but maybe just gives you a lot more NPV and save costs in the longer term, maybe just talk about some of the trade-offs there? Travis Stice : Yeah, let's just talk about the most germain one, which I believe is you see a potential based on way we haven't modeled the degradation of rate of return. But that's offset because of the fact we're increasing net present value. We believe if you don't catch some of these zones now that we've actually been really surprised how good they've turned out. If you don't catch them now, if you think you're going to come back in five to six years and get them. We've seen that that's just not going to work. I think Energen \u2013 legacy Energen assets in Martin County, they did a lot of zone development and then came back in and did zones beneath it. And using that data set and seeing the degradation of not doing them concurrently kind of involving us to make this strategy. Leo Mariani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. Michael Hall : Thanks. Just kind of hit on something I was going to ask, I guess maybe coming out again a little bit. Is it the parent well that has the degradation? Or is it maybe parents not even the right word but is it the primary reservoir or those secondary reservoirs that have the degradation in performance, if you come out after it. Travis Stice : Michael, let's \u2013 yes, I said earlier that if you're trying to compare a Wolfcamp A well in Howard County, which is probably a 80% to 100% rate of return versus co-developing with it Joe Mill or Middle Spraberry, which is probably 35% to 50% rate of return. That's the delta that we're seeing.Obviously, when we've made the decision to singularly develop the zones is really back in 2015 and 2016 when the oil prices and free fall and we were trying to do the highest rate of return, highest rate of return zones. And now we've seen that we believe that co-development is the right strategy on a go-forward basis. Michael Hall : Okay. And it's kind of a use or lose it. It sounds like for the Tier 2 reservoirs and it's those reservoirs that suffer not the Tier 1 if you come back too late. Is that right? Yes that's correct. Travis Stice : Yes that's correct. I mean I wouldn't say you can lose it. If you just use it or you'll have significant degradation in seven \u2013 five, seven years when you come back and try to get the secondary zones. Michael Hall : Okay. That's helpful. And then just circling back quickly on the San Pedro JV. So is it right to think that \u2013 I mean, the actual net CapEx this year, sorry in 2020, is just shy of 2.7% to 2.9 as opposed to 2.8 to 2.3. Just trying to understand like how the actual cash impact will look for 2020 Travis Stice : Yes. So really, it's net $140 million of less CapEx but you probably get net $80 million or so less of production cash flow. So on a free cash flow basis you're getting $50 million to $60 million more of free cash flow. Michael Hall : Yes, okay. So \u2013 but the production guide is net. Is that right? Travis Stice : The production guidance growth and the capital guidance for production is also growth. Michael Hall : Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Travis Stice, the CEO. Sir? Travis Stice : Thanks again to everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions please contact us using the contact information provided. We're in the office all the rest of this week. Operator : This concludes today's conference call everyone. Thank you for joining us. You have a good day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's, fourth quarter 2019 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO.During this conference call the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Before I start with my remarks, I want to pause and recognize an individual who passed away last week, Clayton Williams, who was truly a larger than life West Texan and a man that paved the way for so many in our industry who came after him. He was a wildcatter, a patriarch, a philanthropist, and a Texas Aggie.Later today, we will lay him to rest and celebrate a life well lived, but I couldn't start without reflecting on what Claty has meant to so many people. Mr. Williams and family, our thoughts and prayers are with you today. Godspeed Clayton Williams! You will be missed.Turning to the fourth quarter, Diamondback ended 2019 in a position of strength, achieving 5% oil production growth quarter-over-quarter, along with our highest oil realizations of the year. This, combined with our industry leading cost structure resulted in 18% quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth and 31% quarter-over-quarter adjusted EPS growth.We repurchased 2.4 million shares in the quarter for approximately $199 million, utilizing free cash flow and a $43 million gain from an interest rate swap that was unwound as part of our first investment grade bond offering in November to repurchase shares at a depressed valuation.Further, Diamondback did not slow operations in the second half of 2019 and maintained continuous operations with eight completion crews running consistently through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth and operational momentum in 2020.Taking a step back to review the full year, 2019 was a busy year for Diamondback. We successfully integrated our merger with Energen, doubling the size of our company, while achieving greater cost synergies in a shorter period of time than originally promised at time of deal announcement.We grew pro forma oil production 26% year-over-year from a $2.9 billion capital budget, increased our dividend by 50% and repurchased 6.4 million shares or about 10% of the shares issued to complete the Energen merger.On the corporate development front, we sold non-core assets, dropped down mineral interests to Viper and took our midstream business public. In November, we executed of the final piece of our synergy scorecard and refinanced $3.0 billion of the company's long-term debt, following our upgrade to investment grade at an attractive interest rate.Well, I'm proud of what we accomplished in 2019. We don't spend any time looking backward at our tracks in the sand, but rather looking ahead and concentrating on the future. 2020 has already brought its own industry challenges and we are focused on navigating these challenges by staying disciplined, improving our industry leading cost structure, growing production, increasing environmental transparency and returning more cash to stockholders.Our dividend remains our primary method of returning capital to stockholders and as evidenced through our announcement today, we are strongly committed to continuing to grow this dividend, which sits at a 2% yield at today's stock price. We will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program and outright debt reduction to maintain balance sheet strength, but our dividend is considered first dollar out when it comes to capital allocation at Diamondback.Looking to the year ahead of us, Diamondback expects to grow oil production in the first quarter of 2020 on the back of our strong fourth quarter production in route to our 10% to 15% year-over-year expected oil production growth in 2020. We expect to execute this plan within the same capital budget framework as 2019, while completing 7% more lateral footage with the same amount of capital.Our oil realizations are expected to improve to nearly 100% of WTI in the first quarter of 2020, which will be a nice tailwind for per share metrics. Full service start-up of the EPIC and Gray Oak pipelines in the second quarter will increase our exposure to the export and Gulf Coast markets, as well as increased cash flow through our 10% ownership of each pipeline at Rattler. We will also continue to work to drive down cash operating costs through the year, with LOE expected to decline relative to 2019 numbers.We believe this capital and operating plan reflects the optimal capital efficiency for achieving a peer leading combination of grow and free cash flow in 2020, should commodity prices decline further from current levels, we will be prepared to act responsibly and cut capital further, just like we've done multiple times in the past. If commodity prices rally, we plan to use excess free cash flow to accelerate our capital return program and reduce debt.With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Hey, good morning all, and congrats on your decision to reinforce your return of capital message with a substantial dividend hike. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for you Travis, as we critically evaluate your inventory additions in the well performance trends by intervals, it\u2019s clear to us that the Middle Spraberry in the Delaware Second Bone Spring intervals are becoming more valuable intervals within your inventory set. Focusing on the Bone Spring shale in Pecos, to what degree have you guys delineated the trend across your footprint and are there specific or any specific reasons this interval can't account for a larger percentage of your Delaware allocation in future years. Travis Stice : Yeah, Derrick certainly we are very encouraged at what we're seeing in the Second Bone Springs across our Delaware position and look for continued results like we posted that we're going to continue to allocate more, more capital to the Bone Springs, but you know we are very encouraged about that inventory development and also our existing inventory as we continue to drive down costs and improve returns on all of our Delaware position. Derrick Whitfield : Sure. And as my follow-up, I\u2019ll stay on the Bone Spring shale. I imagine your operations team could drive meaningful cost improvements in a fulfilled development scenario. Could you speak to your current completed well costs in comparison to the Wolfcamp A and also comment on the potential savings you could see in a fulfilled development scenario. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah Derrick, I think from a drilling perspective it's about $40 to $50 a foot cheaper. You know so assuming the same completion design at the Wolfcamp A and Pecos that would be about $0.5 million cheaper on a 10,000 foot lateral. We\u2019ll say one of the benefits is, there's been so much infrastructure dollars, some many infrastructure dollars spent in Pecos that you don\u2019t have to load up the Bone Spring pads with the same level of infrastructure spend as we did for the Wolfcamp A over the last few years. So, you know really excited about the results we are seen there. It\u2019s certainly becoming a competitive zone to the Wolfcamp A and we\u2019ll start to take more of the capital dollars in that field. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks guys. That\u2019s very helpful. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Operator : Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Neal Dingmann : Good morning all. Travis, my first question is on investor metrics. Among the Permian players we have a fuel generated amongst the highest combination of oil drilled free cash flow yield and divided yield at about over 15% already. Could you speak to your confidence on sustainability to maintain this or potentially grow these metrics in todays \u2013 you know or even the lower oil environment. Travis Stice : Sure, Neal. I made a comment in my prepared remarks that our board is committed to continuing to grow our dividend. The free cash flow yield and volume growth, we feel confident that those numbers are multi-year in duration and obviously we've got an inventory that can support that. So we're really pretty excited about sustainable oil production growth, as well as increasing free cash flow, total free cash flow yield and dividend growth as well. Neal Dingmann : Very good and I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask a second question on M&A. Could you all just comment, Travis for you Ks, that your view on the need for M&A especially in such a continued volatile energy tape. Travis Stice : Yeah, you know look Neal, our shareholders expect us to know everything that's going on out here in the Permian and with Bruce on the ground out here, we certainly do, but they also expect us and I know that from our past performance that anything that we consider needs to be accretive, which means you know on several metrics free cash flow, cash flow per share, EPS inventory quality and operational efficiency.So, you know any deal that we're interested in, it\u2019s got to be extremely compelling from a price perspective given our current stock price and the abundance of cheap opportunities out there in the marketplace.As I just was talking to Derrick, you know we\u2019re very confident with our inventory and that inventory is going to drive growth for many years in the future, but we also have responsibility to our shareholders to continue to stay in the game and looking at opportunities that are really attractive. Neal Dingmann : Very good. Thanks for the details. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Thanks, and maybe it\u2019s just a good time to follow up on the last question. Just in general, do you look at your lateral length and you know as you go to these longer and lateral lengths, I mean look at your average lateral inventory. You know how do you see that progressing? I mean is there a lot of opportunities you had to block up? I know you talked about a Northern Delaware transaction, but as you look at your footprint, what should we expect that lateral length to look like, say in the next year or two on average. Travis Stice : Yeah, you know Scott our asset themes you know have their own little business development opportunities where they know that drilling longer laterals improved economics and increased our returns to shareholders through increased free cash generation, and that's part of our day-in and day-out business. We would like to always drill longer laterals. I think somewhere in that 10,000 foot length is probably where our inventory is typified by today, but certainly we\u2019ll look to always to push that. Scott Hanold : Okay, fair enough. And as you step back and talked about the proposition you give for investors in that mid-teens growth, strong free cash flow yield and good dividend yield, you know how do you see that you know growth rate, that production growth rate going forward and you got that low to mid-teens number kind of set right now in this year, but as you look into say 2021, 2022 would you like to maintain that rate? Does that maximize your free cash flow or do you think over time it could fall to sort of the 10% to 12%? Travis Stice : Well, certainly the law of big numbers catches up with you and you know if you're going to maintain flat CapEx on a year-in and year-out basis, that\u2019s going to have an impact on your overall production growth. So we believe that having that double digit growth rate combined with the yield that we have, provides our investors a clear differential investment thesis and we've got the inventory that we think we can support that for multiple years to come. But as we continue to try to grow production on a larger and larger production base, you're going to have to see the CapEx numbers, minus capital efficiencies continue to increase. Scott Hanold : Yeah, and I guess the bottom line, I should have been more succinct in saying, as you look forward to that free cash flow, you know how does it get allocated between dividend, buy backs and investing in the business to continue to grow. Like how does that allocation change over time? Travis Stice : That\u2019s an important point Scott. You know really, free cash flow should be defined as cash flow available above your sustaining CapEx and for us, you know right now the sustaining CapEx to keep production flat, exit-to-exit is about $1.6 billion.Now, above that in the mid-50s oil price environment, we have you know a couple of billion dollars of cash flow to allocate, and today in 2020 we\u2019re allocating two-thirds of that to growth and a third of that to shareholder returns. You know so I think for us, we shouldn't capitulate on growth. I think Diamondback is still a growth story and now it\u2019s a growth with free cash flow story. Scott Hanold : That's perfect. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning Scott. Scott Gruber : Well, just a quick question on the Midland Basin development by zone. You guys have been pretty forthright here with the 2020 mix. Is the mix largely optimized at this point? As we think about \u201821 and beyond, is there much additional shifting between zones and changing that percentage of total development beyond \u201920? Travis Stice : Yes, Scott. So I think you know the big mix, the shift to co-development happened in 2019 with a little carry on into 2020. The whole point of the core development strategy is to get the economic zones that are available today all at the same time.So I think, as you think about development strategy going forward, the Middle Spraberry and the Wolfcamp B will have a bigger piece of the total pie versus past years. I\u2019m hopeful that it stays about consistent to 2020, but as we move across various areas where in some areas the Middle Spraberry is better and in some areas Wolfcamp B is better, but overall this development pace is going to be standard across the company and we are co-developing everywhere in the Midland Basin. Scott Gruber : Got it! And maybe just turning back to the dividend growth to see the doubling today. As we think about you know the go forward, you mentioned continuing to grow the dividend, how do you think about where you want to place the dividend? Obviously the stock price will dictate the yield. The near term, is there a number that you're targeting, you know over the next, call it year or two to continue to grow that dividend? And then longer term, how do you think about a proper pay-out ratio for the business just given the volatility in the commodity price? Travis Stice : Yes Scott, so we\u2019ve heard a lot of feedback from investors over the last 18 months, particularly around the dividend and grow in exchange for that capital return. I think the only consistent message we've heard from our large shareholders is that they want the dividend larger sooner. So for us, you know we took a big jump this year as we are fully shifting to growth plus free cash flow in 2020 and that was an important step for us.Now I think in the future, the dividend is still going to be the primary return of capital and going to need to grow. We don't want to grow it to the point where our implied yield or the payments we need to make on that dividend are a restraint on our business plan, but today it's unfortunate that we got to a 2% yield near the stock price, but we were always focused on getting that dividend to a meaningful level, which is near a couple bucks a share. Scott Gruber : Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. LOE, can you talk about the progression for LOE throughout the year and then what specific projects you guys are working on that will drive improvement? Travis Stice : Hi Gail, yes. So we took it a nice step down in the fourth quarter. We guided to 440 to 480 for the year. I would say the first half of the year, it's probably going to be on the higher end versus the back half of the year we start to see some benefit from large projects, particularly on the electrification side of our fields.Right now we are renting a lot of power generation infield and while that\u2019s \u2013 with these turbans is better than small diesel generators, it's not as efficient as being hooked up to the grid. So as we progress through the year, we should see a nice trend down in LOE based on getting electrification in Howard County, Pecos County and Northwest Martin County. Gail Nicholson : Great, thank you. And then on the infrastructure spend in 2020, what percent of that is one time project versus normal course of business, and how should we think about that trending in \u201821 forward? Travis Stice : Yeah, I would say that's a one-third one-time project. With the integration of Energen, we have learned that some areas are better for gas lift in our field. So there are some gas lift projects that are one-time in nature, and then the electrification as I mentioned there will be some one-time projects.I think you know credit to our facilities team, we're going to complete 340 wells this year and about half of those need zero dollars from an infrastructure perspective. So I think that's a pretty impressive feat by the infrastructure team. Gail Nicholson : Great! Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on one of the earlier questions with regards to the trajectory between CapEx, free cash flow and growth. When you look at your inventory and your expectation for further efficiencies on the cost side, how long do you see your ability to source double digit growth at flat CapEx and where are you on the trajectory versus growing CapEx in future years relative to seeing your growth rate decelerate to the low end or below the 10% to 15% range. Travis Stice : Hey Brian, it's important what service costs are going to do, right. I mean if service costs stay flat, you know our midstream and infrastructure budgets will continue to decrease, and therefore we\u2019re able to get more in that wells within the same budget framework. So I think we\u2019ll address \u201921 and \u201822 as we get closer and see what service costs and oil price does, but we're not going to give up on sustainable growth, but also that growth in the free cash flow on a gross basis year-over-year. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : You know look, the organizational emphasis has always been to grow and as we mentioned earlier, also grow the dividend. You know one of the ways that our guys differentiate themselves in the way that we become more and more capital efficient as we go forward in time end-to-end. Well, we know that that becomes somewhat asymptotic as you go forward in time. You know that's still part of our core competencies, is to pick pennies and nickels up where we used to pick up you know the dimes and quarters. And so organizationally Brian, we are going to continue to drive efficiencies well into the future. Brian Singer : Great! Thanks and then can you add any color on how do you see the production trajectory and CapEx trajectory through the year and the set-up that that would provide going into 2021? Travis Stice : Yeah Brain, you know I think the way we have it setup is to be \u2013 you know operate fairly consistently throughout the year as exhibited by 2019. We did not slowdown in the second half of the year and we have no intention to this year. We're running 21 big rigs today, two salt water disposal rigs and you know 8.5 factors essentially and that pace should be pretty consistent.I think we do plan to grow off of what was a very good number in Q4 and then as you think about the rest of the year, we should have fairly consistent growth from Q2 through Q4. So we would really like to set up here and also the set up for \u201821 as we don't plan on slowing down in the back half of the year. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, you know Brain, just like I was talking about the organizational culture of efficiently, it didn\u2019t make sense to us to go to the operations organization in the back half of last year and say, \u2018okay guys, start laying equipment down and then we're going to ask you to pick it back up in the first quarter and immediately assume the same level of operational management and capital efficiency.\u2019 So that was the reason we decided to continue with the efficiency and that's what's led to what we feel like is a good growth in the first quarter as well. We are not having to catch up or make up ground that we lost from laying down activity in the fourth quarter. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone. Travis Stice : Hey Jeanine, how are you? Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Great! Thank you. My first question is on buybacks versus debt reduction, just following up on some of the prior questions. With the 2% dividend yield now at the current share price, how do you think about buying back stock versus specifically reducing debt? We know that your debt is trading at a higher yield. This could increase strategic flexibility in the future. You've got some nice IT tailwinds going on for you as well. Travis Stice : You know, I\u2019ll let Kaes answer that in detail. But I\u2019ll just say, in general you know, the higher the oil price probably the less you buy back stock in our business and likewise the converse of that's also true; the lower the oil price, the more you're going to buy back. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, I would agree with that. Today, where we are, we still have free cash to buy back stock. We are not concerned with our leverage ratio or overall leverage. Certainly it\u2019s important for an oil and gas company to decrease leverage over time, but unlike other companies, we also have a significant amount of equity in two subsidiaries that is monetizable, you know not at a moment's notice, but can be monetized.So I think for us on the balance sheet side, we're going to keep taking care of converting our old high yield notes into IG notes throughout the year and continue to drive down the overall interest expense at the company. Jeanine Wai : Hey great, that's very helpful. And my second question is on inventory. How do you think about the cost of adding Tier 1 inventory? For example, how did the cost compare from moving current Tier 1 \u2013 current inventory into Tier 1 via exploration, appraisal, whatever else you may think of verses inorganic additions either via M&A and acreage trades tend to be pretty high ROIs as well. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, acreage trades are certainly the highest rate of return possible and we got about 40 of them done last year with the two combined businesses of Energen and Diamondback. So that was a lot of low hanging fruit for us to improve. Now you know I'll let Travis comment on the other piece, but all I would say is that any inventory additions today in the Permian are significantly cheaper than they have been in any time in our short history. Travis Stice : Yeah, like I mentioned earlier, you know we have a set of metrics that we have to be accretive on and we'll continue to \u2013 we\u2019ve always done accretive deals and we\u2019ll always look at these accretive metrics.You mentioned like three different ways and one of them was exploration and while that's been a very small part of Diamondbacks history, we did release results on our 25,000 acre play that we entered in about three years ago with \u2013 had a really, really low cost on this energy well and while for a $20 billion company, one well test is not particularly that significant, but it sure was a good test for the first well that we drilled, the Xanadu well.I think it\u2019s IP 30 or something over 100 barrels a foot and now we're turning it over to the execution guys who would be moving to the appraisal stage and drive costs down and as we drive costs down it\u2019s going to push up the returns for that and you know probably attract a one to two rig program in our future capital allocation decisions.So it\u2019s really all three of those things. Acreage trades are certainly a day-in and day-out opportunity, looking you know at accretive acquisitions you know and extremely low valuations that we see today and then we sprinkled in a little bit of exploration success. So I think we're executing on all three of those strategies. Jeanine Wai : Thanks. Great! Very helpful. Thank you for the detailed response. Travis Stice : Thank you Jeanine. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital. Jeff Grampp : Good morning guys. Travis Stice : Hey Jeff. Jeff Grampp : Was curious, we\u2019ve talked a bit on kind of how you guys are thinking about growing the business going forward and I guess related to that I was wondering, if I'm looking at slide 10 I think, you guys referenced both the PDP oil decline and BOE decline rates. How should we think about those changing given that you guys will still be growing the base? Do those really moderate at all given that you are still growing or just kind of wondering high level, like if we had rolled out forward 12 months, how do you guys think that maybe changes if at all? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes Jeff, it won\u2019t moderate much. You know we will have a big tailwind from 2019 to 2020 on the decline. You know 2019\u2019s decline was north of 40% on the oil side. This year you know high 30\u2019s on the oil side, you know given that we're no longer maximizing growth within cash flow and accelerating or adding you know five or six rigs this year, so you know that should help. I can't guarantee that it'll keep going down from here, but certainly don't expect it to ramp up significantly given the steady state development we\u2019re heading towards. Jeff Grampp : Got it. Thanks guys. For my follow up, Travis may be for you, you know you guys in the prepared remarks obviously had a substantial checklist of accomplishments that you guys did in 2019. I was wondering, you know what's on the 2020 checklist in terms of kind of more strategic objectives or goals for the business in 2020 that you know maybe in 12 months you\u2019d come back on the 4Q \u201820 call and tell us about. Travis Stice : Well, certainly as we sit here today, the level of major corporate development objectives that we had in 2019 won\u2019t be repeated in 2020. That was an incredibly you know busy year for us. What we're really focused on this year is you know growing the business, increasing shareholder returns and really refining you know our differential story of growth and yield and we think we've got the framework exactly suited to be able to do that. Jeff Grampp : Got it! Alright, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Travis Stice : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Bank of America. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning. I have one for Kaes and a follow up for Travis. Kaes, I appreciate the update on sustaining CapEx, but historically you have talked about generating a $675 million of free cash flow at $55 oil. Could you talk about the sensitivity to this free cash flow to changes in oil price and how would you think about adapting the activity program to lower oil prices, say in a $45 scenario. Travis Stice : Yeah Asit, you know I'll take the second part first you know. If we saw $45 oil for a couple of months, you know we would do the right decision, make the right decision and cut back on capital spending. You know I will say you know this this addition of free cash flow to the story now allows us to not whipsaw around our activity levels based on you know a weekly or daily or a monthly move in commodity price.So this gives us an operations organization, you know an ability to continue to operate steadily and you know drive efficiencies through the year. You know on the free cash flow side certainly you know above 55 we start to get a lot of the benefit of you know, our three way colors or unhedged production. So I think at the mid-point of our guidance on oil, you know $1 in oil price above 55 gives you, you know $65 million or $70 million of free cash. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And I\u2019ll just add to that from a general perspective or might be a higher level perspective. You know Diamondback has always demonstrated that you know when returns you know to our investors go up, you know we lean into that. Now we\u2019ve moderated that comment a little bit now, because we're still focused on free cash flow generation, but what goes along with that is when returns go down to our shareholders, we slow activity down and I think you go back in early 2015 and again in 2016 and even again in late 2018. We've got a track record of doing just that when the commodity tells us we\u2019re not getting paid for it, you know we moderate all activity accordingly. Asit Sen : Thanks. Travis, a follow-up for you. You guys have been a leader in making changes to compensation structure and appreciate ESG component as part of management scorecard. Could you provide some early examples of some of the metrics that you're going to track? What's motivating this move and perhaps speak to the issue of flaring and how PRRC has positioned Texas and your conversations with them. Travis Stice : Sure. You know the one thing just I want to point out is that, the transparency that we try to communicate with our investors we believe is best-in-class and we spend a lot of time talking to our large shareholders and some of the things that we instituted in this release were as a result of direct communication with those shareholders. Things like holding ourselves accountable for ES&G measures. You know we've got \u2013 you know it might be up to 10% to 15% now.Every individual\u2019s compensation is going to be tied to ES&G metrics. Things like water recycle, spill control, total recordable incidence rate, flaring, those are not subject to discretion. Those are quantitative measures that we will incentivize you know a better performance on. That's one thing that we've proven at Diamondback is, what gets rewarded gets done and we intend to do that in our scorecard.You know we've also adjusted, and again we've laid it out in a very transparent way, but \u2013 and will be some more when we release our proxy here in a month or so. You know we've adjusted now our total shareholder return you know to where we have modifiers for anything below 0% or negative TSR. We've now got a modifier that takes down our long term incentives.Now the converse of that's also true. Anything above a 15% total shareholder return gets some adder, but again, that's in response to conversations that we've had with our shareholders. So we really have two objectives. We have the first which I think is the most important, is that we want to be best-in-class on all of our ES&G measures. And secondly, we want to be best-in-class on the disclosure associated with those things and we believe that what we released last night is a very important first step in achieving both of those objectives. Asit Sen : And on flaring Travis? Travis Stice : Yes, so flaring in the Permian basin is an issue that we as an industry have to address. There's flaring that's voluntary flaring that should be eliminated as quickly as we can. I mean companies have to put their balance sheets to work and you know make sure the gathering system is in place prior to bringing on wells. Certainly at Diamondback we follow that to the strictest letter.There's also you know a collaboration that we have to make with our gatherers. You know even if we're tied into systems, our gatherers have to make sure that they've got you know contracts in place that allow that gas to be you know custody transferred at the well head and that gas moved to market. And so it's really \u2013 it's not all in the upstream guys. It's really a holistic issue that needs to be addressed by everyone to try to eliminate you know a certainly routine flaring now here in the Permian as quickly as we can. Asit Sen : I appreciate the color Travis. Thank you. Travis Stice : And I'll just add to that. I\u2019ll see if that\u2019s you know \u2013 the scorecard that we've added you know in the ES&G has flaring in there and I can tell you from, you know from a \u2013 we talk about it on our executive meeting. We have you know pretty rigorous reports that we review every week and we talk about creative ways that Diamondback or Rattler could bring the balance sheet to their \u2013 to cause you know a flaring to be eliminated quicker than if we just relied on somebody else. So we're trying to be creative and willing to put our balance sheet to work if need be to eliminate the flaring. Asit Sen : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow ups on just the Pecos activity. I think the first half of the year you guys are running about six rigs there right now. Is the plan, does that slow in the back half of the year and then going into 2021 or should we think about that as kind of a steady state program? Travis Stice : Yeah David, I mean it\u2019s more about completion cadence right. So in the first half of the year you know we do have more completions in Pecos than the back half. You know I think overall you know 2019 we completed almost 100 wells in that field and you know I think the goal here as an organization is to get that down to 60 or 70 on a go forward basis.So when we are allocating capital in the second half of the year to better return areas, one rig going to ReWard and one rig going to the northern Midland basin, particularly as the held-by-production issues that we had in Pecos has subsided and you know we can have a more steady state plan there with you know five rigs or so running full time. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And David, I\u2019ll tell you, the execution teams, particularly in Pecos county have done a remarkable job of you know maintaining results or improving results, some of which we talked about in the Second Bone Springs, but they'd really driven a lot of costs out of the equation and so now the returns continue to improve with the same or better EUR\u2019s per foot, but much lower cost per foot. So you know it\u2019s again a good example of what Diamondback excels at as you work on the numerator and the denominator at the same time and we're driving the rate of return positively for our shareholders. David Deckelbaum : For sure. It\u2019s encouraging to hear that. It also sounds that as you get into the back half of \u201820 and going into \u201921, absent everything else, some of those HBP obligations obviously subside going into \u201921? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Correct. David Deckelbaum : And then I just wanted just to ask one more, just framing this conversation around M&A. You\u2019ve highlighted a lot of priorities around sustainable free cash dividends growth. When you screen now for M&A, you start with a priority of free cash accretion, because you did talk about obviously things have to be accretive. You also talked about acreage you know being at heavily discounted valuations right now. Do you still see room for you know what would otherwise be NAV-accretive M&A or does everything now have to become free cash accretive. Travis Stice : Well, certainly that has vaulted to the top of the category list of the things we look at, but we really focus on several key metrics. If you're asking probably what we screened on the first certainly free cash flow per share, it is way up there. Also cash flow per share, earnings per share and then you know the more traditional measures of inventory quality and what Diamondback can do with that property you know in the form of operational efficiency and then of course NAV is what we still fundamentally believe, that NAV is an important valuation metric for our business. But you know those are what we believe are the right ways to focus on anything you're looking at. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And right now the stock word is we\u2019re focused on buying back the stock, because it\u2019s trading at the deeper discount to NAV than anything we're seeing in the market. Travis Stice : Yeah, I agree with that. David Deckelbaum : Understood! And thanks for confirming we don't have to delete our NAV model just yet, but thanks guys. Travis Stice : Yeah, hold on to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall : Thanks. Good morning. Just answered my question as it relates to how the stock price looks relative to M&A opportunities, so thanks for that.I guess the second one I had just to follow-up a little bit on the evolution of co-development. You addressed it in the Midland basin, but most securities in the Delaware is just kind of looked on the slides, the proportion of the Wolfcamp A that\u2019s driving the 2020 program on slide 14 I guess, how does that evolve over time? Should we expect that to kind of grind lower as a percentage of the total in \u201821 and beyond or any color on that? Travis Stice : Yeah Michael, I think that's fair, right. I mean there\u2019s a secondary zone in each of our three fields that we think you know competes for capital today and Pecos, it\u2019s the Second Bone Spring, so that's going to get more attention. In ReWard it\u2019s the Third Bone Spring. You know we're doing a lot more co-development between the A and the Third Bone Spring in that acreage position in 2020 and beyond.And then up in the Vermejo area, the Third Bone Spring is good, but also the Wolfcamp B you know deserves some attention from a rate of returns perspective. So each of those fields has a different development strategy, but you know unlike the Midland basin, where in the Midland basin the zones that are being co-developed from a rate of return perspective are in a narrow band. You know the Wolfcamp A versus the others on the Delaware basin had always said, drill to Wolfcamp A and go to the other zones later, but with the Second Bone particularly in Pecos getting better, that's getting more attention. Michael Hall : Great! That's helpful color. I appreciate it. Thanks guys. Travis Stice : Thanks Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, to you and your whole team there. I want to go back to the \u2013 there\u2019s a little bit of tension in some your \u2013 or at least I see some tension in your prepared comments. You talked about how you know we've had a lot of volatility in late \u201819 and even in early \u201820 with the commodity price; that\u2019s on one hand, but on the other hand I get your message that the dividend, your commitment to the dividend is, you're committed to it and those are the first dollars out the door.But I'm wondering if in broad terms you can give us any insight your thinking or the boards thinking? Is there a limit, maybe a soft limit on the percentage of your cash flow from ops that you wouldn\u2019t want to exceed in terms of the dividend payout if commodity prices fell lower and conversely \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry. Travis Stice : No, finish, I\u2019m sorry. Charles Meade : No, I would say conversely is there some minimum level that you're targeting if oil prices hit higher. Travis Stice : Yeah you can go by and look at some of our previous prepared remarks where we talked about the board you know wanting to seek a dividend yield that approaches the S&P 500 and you know to get prescriptive, much beyond that, we don't think is the right way to communicate that message.Kaes outlines right now that how we look at \u2013 what to do with free cash flow above our maintenance CapEx, but I think at the end of the day Charles, just simply said, when we look at capital allocation, we look at ways to drive not only current shareholder value, but also long term shareholder value and some of the dividend, and the growth of that dividend is very important in that conversation.What we have seen is, some companies that get dividend, let the dividend get so high, it actually can become an impediment to doing what oil and gas companies are supposed to do, which is convert resource into cash flow. So we are ever mindful of that, but it's a discussion that we have at the board level on an annual basis and I can just tell you that we're laser focused on current shareholder value creation and long term shareholder value creation. Charles Meade : Yeah, that's helpful color, thank you for that Travis. And then going back to your limelight, your limelight well and I appreciate your earlier comments that you guys are a much bigger company now, certainly than when you guided this play three years ago, but that it's still encouraging to get that kind of first well result. What would you need to see \u2013 in the combination between well cost from here and productivity from this first well, what would you need to see from the play to make it really compete in the top tier of your overall portfolio for capital? Travis Stice : So we are pretty pleased with the oil profile that came out of it, that we are seeing so far in that first well and the decline profile looks actually pretty good. Of course we are ever mindful of this single well intersection, but you know I think its two things. One, you've always got to push you know greater recoveries and we have to push a lower development cost, which is something that\u2019s right in the wheelhouse of a Diamondback operations teams, both driving EUR and reducing well costs.So I think there is more to come on this story. We\u2019ll probably drill one or two more appraisal wells this year and then, you know we\u2019ll talk about it more in 2021 if we are successful in accomplishing those objectives and it starts attracting more capital in the allocation process. Charles Meade : Thank you for that, Travis. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Hey thanks, good morning. Travis, real quick on limelight, just to continue with that theme. You drove the Merrimack with the Xanadu well. The upcoming appraisals, do you anticipate going after any other targets there in limelight area? Travis Stice : Yeah, I\u2019m going to let Dave answer the question. Dave. Dave Cannon : Yeah, for the next two wells that we have upcoming for the appraisal project, as we move to the south within the limelight trend, we are actually going to be targeting the upper portion of the Woodford. I mean then we are going to be drilling the well close by to the Xanadu, further driving development efficiencies into the Merrimack itself. Richard Tullis : Okay, thank you. And lastly for me, looking at the Northern Delaware basin acreage swap referenced in the release, how did that transaction or group of transactions come together and how much net acreage remains in New Mexico? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah Richard, we\u2019ve worked on probably almost 40 trades throughout the year. This was certainly the largest for us. Entering New Mexico as an operator to operate six or seven sections just didn\u2019t make sense you know given that we get bolt on to other blocks of acreage that we operate in Texas. So that certainly \u2013 that trade is one of many that worked out really well. Today we have about 2,500 acres left in New Mexico, primarily non-op with you know one operated well. Richard Tullis : Alright Kaes, thanks so much. I appreciate it. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Good afternoon guys. I just wanted to follow-up on one of your earlier comments here just as a point of clarity. If I heard it correctly, did you guys kind of say that you know production growth on a quarterly basis in 20 would be maybe a little slower in the first quarter and then picked-up in second quarter of \u201820 and then kind of be steady for the rest of the year. I just wanted to make sure I understood that cadence. Travis Stice : Yes, that\u2019s fair Leo. You know we plan to grow off of what was a very, very good number in Q4. It exceeded our internal expectations, but we do expect to grow off that number in Q1 and then have steady growth throughout the year. Leo Mariani : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just with respect to well costs, I wanted to see if you could kind of give us anything, a little bit sort of leading edge here in terms of maybe what you've seen. You know in the last couple of months here just to kind of kick off the year in 2020 maybe versus you know fourth quarter averages. Were you guys able to continue to drive, efficiencies or maybe benefit from some lower service costs deals that you might have negotiated in 4Q to kind of start the year in \u201920. Any comments around that? Travis Stice : Yeah, so service cost reductions are not things that we count on as we forecast our capital budget. Those are not permanent. We know when commodity price turns back around, those go away. What we really are focused on is what type of cost improvements can we make that are more permanent in nature and that\u2019s again what I \u2013 the Diamondback operations organization just absolutely excels.You know we were talking just this week about a 15,000 foot lateral that we got drilling in 11 or 12 days and so we can continue to see faster and faster well results from our operations organization and we expect that to continue to happen throughout this year. Leo Mariani : Okay, thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks Leo. Operator : And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks again to everyone for participating in today\u2019s call. If you got any questions please contact us using the contract information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day!",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Kurt. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO.During this conference call the participants may make certain Forward-Looking Statements relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC.In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.I will now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback\u2019s first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I would like to take a minute to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the Coronavirus pandemic. The challenges presented so far in 2020 are unprecedented for the first perseverance is evident in the decisive action we have taken to preserve our strength in this cycle.Our organization has now been now been working from home for almost two months. And I can honestly say that business has performed extraordinarily well given the circumstances. Our teams have reacted quickly to the rapidly changing landscape and adjusted our operating and capital program in almost real time to prepare Diamondback for the commodity price weaknesses we are experiencing today.Crisis have a way of revealing characters and we have witnessed this across our organization. And I'm confident that you as our stockholders and owners of the Company will be proud of how our employees have responded in supporting the communities where we live and work. We have an organization of motivated and exceptionally talented people.Turning to the first quarter. Diamondback grew oil production 3% quarter-over-quarter and unhedged oil organization averaged 99% of WCI or highest oil realization in almost two years. We returned 80 operated wells to production in the quarter as our operations machine was executing efficiently before commodity prices weakened and we immediately ceased all completion activity in March.We expected to complete less than 10% of our 2020 well count in second quarter, with the only planned completions for the purpose of [indiscernible] slow operations in the fourth quarter of 2019, and maintained continuous operations with over 20 rigs and eight completion crews running through most of the first quarter. Capital spend was 709 million or a little over 27% of our original capital budget for the year.When commodity prices dropped, we took immediate action and dropped all of our completion crews per month, and are working down our rig count as quickly as possible without paying in early termination fees in existing rig contracts.While we are running 14 rigs today, we will exit May running 10 rigs and enter the third quarter running eight down over 60% from the beginning of the year. We also plan to enter the fourth quarter running seven rigs, with the ability to reduce further into 2021. This rig count reduction combined with our current completion schedule means we will exit 2020 with over 150 ducts.This is over 100 ducts above what will be required as a standard working duct inventory for three to five completion crew program, which is our base case program exiting 2020 as we see things today.While this may be a drag on overall capital efficiency in 2020, it will give us significant flexibility and be a benefit to capital efficiency over the next couple of years, particularly in 2021 as we navigate and uncertain forward outlook.Because CapEx is a cash flow statement number, we will start to see our reduction activity benefit our cash and at the end of the second quarter and through the back half of 2020. As a rule of thumb, activity reductions today are reflected two months later in cash flow statement. While commodity price fluctuations are realized in the month in which they occur.As a result, our CapEx spend will be weighted toward the front half of 2020 with the third quarter, beginning to truly reflect the significant activity reductions that began in March and continued into the second quarter.Diamondback is curtailing gross operating production, about 10% to 15% this month, due to the uncertainty in the forward oil price contracts and the risk of low unhedged realized oil prices for the mill.With differentials in role already set heading into the month at over $10 off the WTI. The risk of WTI prices declining further outweighs the benefit of producing as much as possible into extremely low unhedged realized prices.We have hedged production for nearly 100% of expected oil production before curtailments, including basis in both protection, and therefore can monetize in the money hedges without materially impacting the fact cash flow when production is curtailed.In assessing where to curtail production, we focused on fixed and variable operating costs and underline marketing contracts, choosing to slow production where we do not need to spend significant dollars to do so.We will continue to monitor future prices as we prepare to nominate production for June and the months ahead. And should meaningful curtailments persist or accelerate, we will plan to update our investors accordingly.Looking ahead due to the volatility in commodity prices, there is significant uncertainty in our full business plan. And we are trying to stay flexible on how many completion crews we bring back to work in the second half of the year, and which month both crews get back to work. We need to see some stability in the forward curve before making this decision.In the interim, we will continue to focus on what we can control, which is our cost structure and preserve as much liquidity as possible. We ended the first quarter with 1.9 billion of liquidity and only have one term debt maturity due in the next five years, a 400 million maturity due September 2021. With our reduction in spending, current hedge protection and suspension of our buyback program, we expect to maximize liquidity and retain cash to pay down debt.Our dividends remains our primary return of capitals for our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividends based on the current board outlook. Paying our interest expense, retaining our people and paying our dividend remain our priorities through these uncertain times.To finish, Diamondback is prepared to operate in a lower for longer oil price environment and our cost structure will prove to be a differentiator through this downturn. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry leading low cash G&A, a full hedge book, strong midstream contracts and the benefit of Viper and Rattler will allow them to operate effectively through these uncertain times.With these comments now complete. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the comment there towards the end with regard to the use of cash and free cash flow. You talked about the spending the buyback, you have got the $400 million debt coming due next year. In a scenario where cash builds beyond that or where your free cash flow gets you above a $400 million cushion to pay down that debt. Do you still hold cash for future debt coming due? Or do you think about either bringing back the buyback considering variable dividends or distributions? How are you thinking about free cash flow and use of cash? Travis Stice : Well, certainly that is multiple quarters out as we look into next year and all of those options are still available to us. In terms of - we announced the suspension of a share buyback program. But we also don't have a full - an intention at the board level to afford cash and so, we will continue to be judicious in the way that we allocate excess cash, as we highlighted primarily through the form of our dividend program. Brian Singer : Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is with regard to cyclical versus secular benefits from the downside goal, you talk to cost production that you see here this year. And I wondered if you could speak to what you are kind of seeing as potential cyclical versus secular impacts, either on the productivity side and learning there or on the on the cost side, what percent of the cost reductions you are achieving this year, do you think would extend if prices where to rebound? Travis Stice : Well, if we just look at the Delaware basin, and particularly I think over the last couple of quarters, we have taken a $100 a foot out of the DC and e-components. And those are permanent savings regardless of the cyclicality of our business. On the midland basin side, we have probably taken out 50 or 60. And again, a lot of those are also going to be made permanent.We understand that our business partners on the service side, are really in a bind, and we do know that in the future, when commodity prices begin to recover, that side of our business will have to repair their balance sheets and we will require more consideration from other operators and that is the cyclical nature of there.But we don't know when that is going to occur. We do think that the rate of change, going forward, just from a planning perspective, the rate of change is getting smaller relative to where it was the last time we went through this in 2015 and 2016.But it is still our organization's intent to find those elements that will survive past the cyclical nature and actually make them permanent in the way that we go about prosecuting our development plan.So what percent, is lot harder to predict? It is smaller today, then when you likely ask me that at 2015 and 2016. But we are still trying everyday to identify and make permanent those savings. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks. Good morning all. Travis Stice : Good morning. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, with regard to your 2020 outlook. I certainly appreciate the challenges of providing quarterly guidance in the current environment. Assuming the capital plan outline, is it reasonable to assume the previous exit rate guidance broadly remains in place, less relatively small timing effects associated with returning curtail production back online? Travis Stice : Yes. Derek, thank you. That is fair, I think we are sticking to that exit rate guidance, pending, getting back to work in the back half of the year. I think if first of all curtailed volumes seem to come back before we start completing new wells, and if curtailed volumes come back, and then we start completing wells, late in the summer or into the fall, then that number is certainly achievable.[Audio Gap] continue to be curtailed or delay our return back to work and lock update the market, as we have, four times in the last month and a half, and give you the latest data that we are seeing. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks very helpful and you guys have been quite responsive in the environment. So certainly appreciate that as well. With my second question, focusing on the voluntary curtailments that you discussed for May, are there any marketing limitations or technical considerations that would limit your ability to compare volumes beyond that 10% to 15% level? Travis Stice : No. We are still very far away from any marketing commitments being triggers. We produced a little over 250,000 gross barrels of oil a day in the first quarter. And our true take or pay commitments are about 125,000 barrels a day today. So we are still pretty far away from triggering anything of those. And, the secondary thought behind the cash operating costs was where we are curtailing in the marketing contracts associated with the barrels that we are curtailing. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks guys. Very well done in this challenging environment. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Your line is now open. Gail Nicholson : Good morning everybody. Just looking at work over. In a normal environments, do you know what percent of LOE workover comprise? And then how should we think about workover activity going forward? And do you have any thoughts if making an adjustment to workover to have an effect on future wells productivity? Travis Stice : Yes. So Gail, typically we are round 20, 25 workover hits on a daily basis, just doing routine maintenance and part of this curtailments effects that we are going through right now is that we reduced that number to less than 10, maybe on some days, even less than five. So as wells fail or have problems we are electing, at least in the month of May now to go out and repair them.As long as we don't have those types of failed wells shut-in for a very long period of time, you know months, I'm not worried about having to go back in and remediate those wells. Yet, there will be a cost, but that cost will be pushed out several months in that scenario, but the productivity shouldn't be impacted. And as we are talking about multiple, multiple months. But that is where we are thinking about it now. Gail Nicholson : Okay, great. And then I really appreciate Slide 9 the color regarding the Midland based contracts. But I'm just curious if you could talk about just how those pieces change regarding an MEH and a Brent contract on Slide 9? Travis Stice : Yes Gail, so, we wanted to show the slide to show investors how we are thinking about curtailing volumes. And while we are supposed to put flat price throughout the month, the role and the differentials had already been fixed going into May. I will say its contract dependent, so, all we speak for Diamondback contracts, but, majority of our Brent based contracts have a Brent role components, so it is a Brent role because it is been in less contained [indiscernible] WTI will be a significantly smaller number. Gail Nicholson : Okay. Great. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you Gail. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Neal Dingmann with SunTrust. Your line is now opened. Neal Dingman : Well hope you all been well. My first question centers on really you three stream production growth and specifically how your view in the timing and rate of growth for each of the three streams to ramp after your D&C is suspended, and the production is curtailed or maybe if I would ask another way, how do you view certain I know you got to guide out there but how do you view the near-term future oil versus natural gas growth? Travis Stice : Yes Neal. No question with the production stream declining overall, oil going to decline faster than your BOEs and I think we framed our oil production base decline in the mid-30s with our BOE base decline in the low-30s percentages.So, I'm hopeful that if we do get back to work, we are going to try to combat that decline, some high or oil percentage Midland basin activity. But given the uncertainty today, I think overall, those numbers that we have out there on base decline are still valid. Neal Dingman : Yes. That is great details. And then just my second question really focuses on cost. You know Travis for you in case you'll continue to be certainly the cost leaders in the group, when you speak to kind of 850 as cash cost, and I think what Midland well cost down, I think what is 700 or 600 per foot. I'm just wondering, you touched on this a little bit earlier. Is there room to squeeze even more out of that or how do you all view just sort of these margins going forward given like a how well you are cost already down to? Travis Stice : Yes. I think I answered it a little bit on the previous question about the rate of change and cost is certainly a lot smaller now than it was in 2015 and 2016 when we went through the cycle. Look, there is two ways to work on that. There is things like I emphasized that we can make permanent those things move on forever. And that is, loading completely as well as faster, it get the TD faster, those are all elements of making permanent cost savings.Whether our business partners on the service side, continue to offer concessions, beyond this point, there is probably going to be some, but we do feel like the majority of those have been offered up in the month of April and in May as the industry has recalibrated quicker than anything we have ever seen. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Again I think if you dig into the cash cost fees, we are going to try to keep LOE flattish, productions coming down so that is going to hurt LOE a little bit, G&A is still going to stay best-in-class and the other pieces of cash cost some on the tax piece given percent of revenue, continues to go down, that should come down a little bit. But we are fighting for pennies and nickels here. Travis Stice : And you know Neal, we have got a lot of information in our deck, what we are talking about cost, and improvements quarter-over-quarter and I think it is important to recognize that one of the reasons that we try to answer the questions with as much detail as we can and that why as Kaes pointed that we have updated the market four times in the last month and a half.It is because when times were uncertain and our investors that own the company, have questions, transparency is more important than ever. So, even though we might have had a free pass full of guidance, it is just not part of our culture of transparency.We are going to tell you everything we can within the rules of financial disclosure, so that you can make the best investment decisions that you can and the only way that we can do that is to be very, very transparent.And so whether it is in a background, or prepared remarks or in the Q&A that transparency is needed for tenants of dial back energy, and we tend to follow that through these uncertain times and into the future. Neal Dingman : Now I appreciate all the details Travis. That certainly helps. Thanks, guys. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks Neal. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Scott. Scott Gruber : So before the downturn, there was the expectation that your well productivity on average would improved over the course of 2020, as HBP drilling fell even further and you shifted rigs, probably focusing obviously on best well economics, which includes not only productivity but also obviously well costs and minerals position and infrastructure needs. So can you provide some color on the productivity trend, on a go forward basis from here should it improve, as previously expected and any color an order of magnitude? Travis Stice : Well, there is two ways in well productivity is, if you complete in the same well, one month versus next is that productivity improved in the current month versus the prior months. And there is also a way that productivity looks better on the macro sense, because you are shifting the mix of projects that you are doing.And so most of what we were focusing on in our earlier communication was highlighting the shift from the Delaware Basin more towards the Midland Basin where we had mineral ownerships within our sub Viper and then also not having to spend any, or limited infrastructure dollars.So, we are still going to see that effect through the course of this year as our program migrates more into the Midland Basin side. And as I've answered now a couple of times, I still think there is room to see changes that we are making due to doing things better than we have done in the past, and those are the things that that live on as the ones who make current. Scott Gruber : Got it. I appreciate the color. That is it for me. I will turn it back. Thank you. Travis Stice : And let me just add, when you think about where the service sector is, I certainly don't intend to be a spokesperson for the service sector. I don't understand their finances like they do. And so, really whether or not they continue to reduce costs, and it is to the benefit, at least near-term to down with that shareholders.Those are really questions that are best asked and answered on that side. What I'm leaning into our organization for is how can we do things better every day, regardless of the cyclical nature of what our business partners on the service side is. Scott Gruber : Appreciate the color Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Yes, thanks. Thanks for all the colors so far. On the duct, the pretty interesting comment that you guys would be carrying in, 100 ducts into 2021. Can you give a sense of, was that an intentional process through 2020 given the cost structure coming down enough? Was it somewhat where your rig contracts were and just didn\u2019t want to complete the wells or you just wanted some, dry powder of wells to reactivate when you could. So, can you give us a sense of, how you balance that activity and decisions through this year? Travis Stice : Yes, it is really Scott a combination of all three of those. I mean, we definitely had rig contracts and every dollar counts and while those rigs counts wind out this year, we didn't want to pay early termination fees. But also when you think about 2021, and carrying in a large number of ducts, we are really covered off on both the bull case and the bear case.In the bull case, we will have a bunch of really high quality ducts that we can bring on to production quickly in 2021 if we get paid for the commodity we produce. On the bear case, if it gets bad, then we probably won't drill many - if any wells at all in 2021 and whatever via maintenance that we feel like we can get paid for we can do that just by completing these extremely high rate of return on a cost forward basis. Scott Hanold : So my thoughts could be on the decisions, as you look into that bull case, like what are the really the triggers that made you think about that bull case and also just really quickly what do those ducts, how much of an impact on the 2021 maintenance capital did those ducts have? Travis Stice : Well, we have never tried to predict oil price and what a bull case looks like in 2021, I'm not even saying that that is necessarily going to occur, what we are trying to do is rather than predict, we are trying to cover off both extremes, what likely outcomes could be next year. In terms of the duct impact on maintenance CapEx? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Scott, we came out with a number. About a month ago, saying could to keep exit rate production flat year-over-year in 2021about 25% less capital than 2020. I think that number still stands. And that probably assumes, you are drawing down 40 or 50 ducts.I think our base case today, if you had to get access in somewhere in the range of three to five completion crews. And the rule of thumb that we have is, 10 working ducts for each completion crew, so we are going to have about 100 extra ducts at year-end 2021, to have options with. Scott Hanold : Yes. And just to be more specific, I wasn\u2019t asked I guess in particular, what you all think about the bull case of next year? Just what price signal like what price does it have to be to start thinking about getting a little bit more active and dipping into those ducts? Travis Stice : Well assuming where we are today, right, the first thing we would have to do is your brain deferred production back on and then to talk about increased activities, again, there is a lot of factors that went into that, but you have got to have prices in the high 20s, or low 30s. Before we kind of signal going back to working in an aggressive, or even in a non-aggressive way. But again, we are going to take all of these things into consideration before we come out in a market on what our activity plans are back half of this year or in the next year as well. Scott Hanold : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning guys, thanks for the time today. Travis Stice : You bet, David. David Deckelbaum : I was just hoping maybe you could shed a little bit more color on the theoretical 21 maintenance program. How many wells have that division you are being able to or needing to turn in line to hold the current exit guide flat in 2021? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Probably about 150, David. Plus or minus 10 or 15 wells on each side of that, just based on the wells we are drilling today and what just completed and the work we are going to be pretty heavy in Midland basin probably 70/30 Midland basin or 75/25 Midland basin in areas where we have high mineral interest and very little capital required on the infrastructure side. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And then I guess I just wanted to get back to the curtailments. One, could you update us this on I know you kind of hedged your comments and said, if we need to do something in June, then obviously guidance changes. What are your thoughts on June right now? How do you see the market shaping up and balancing? I know these curtailments are economically driven. Price signals have improved the bit for June. What are you seeing, we are just excited in the basin side? And how do you see the shaping up with granted, we are several weeks away, but how is it looking currently? Travis Stice : Well, you know looking a little better for June to be honest. If the dips in the well, being significantly, you want to well side significantly less negative on the dip side, being Midland trading at a premium recently for WTI and on top of that WTL trading at a premium to WTI.So I never thought $22 would be exciting, but here we are, looking at our cash cost for June and I think as we sit today, we have nominations due in two weeks. As we sit today it certainly looks better for the June month from a contract perspective than it did in May. David Deckelbaum : Yes, cheers for 2022. If I could just have one quick one, just thinking about the logistics of the curtail volumes that you have now, I guess about 2,500% wells in Midlands, another 500 plus in the Delaware, what percentage overall of those wells are being curtailed right now? Or I guess how many wells can you say are being curtailed? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, just about 500 total, and I would say over two-thirds of those are in the Delaware. And so what we really focused on, and we really focused on the term curtail, because we are not shutting these wells in and having spend dollars to shut well in. We are trying to limit the cash outflow and really, just curtail producing wealth to a lower level than where they were in April and March. David Deckelbaum : Thanks for the color guys. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Jeff Grampp with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Grampp : God morning. I was curious how you guys - maybe a kind of philosophical question, pricing environment both on the commodity and well cost have obviously changed quite a bit over the last several months. Are you guys internally discussing maybe reevaluating, wells spacing or completion techniques as far as what an optimal design could be and with today's service costs and oil price environment? Travis Stice : Yes, those are certainly things that we are examining, but one thing that, I have been pleased with is that our spacing assumptions when they have been validated now for almost five years, really haven't ever changed and we have never been part of that drill wells too closely or stack and to tightly together.So, the rule of thumb has always been, the higher the oil price, the closer spaces, you could put your wells because you can capitalize on acceleration and the lower price, or is the water you should spread out, but we have been, we follow that, but we have been pleased that our spacing assumptions seem to struck the right balance now for multiple years and a lot of technical review with our reserve auditors have validated that.So we have never really tightened them up and then some instances, maybe even in Delaware, in some of the new developed zones, we might have slightly increased the well spacing, but in a general sense, we have been very conservative on how we count locations and how we develop these reservoirs.When you look at the completion side, Jeff we are always trying to do everything we can to extract the most hydrocarbons from these rocks and it was stimulated rock volume near well bores is a key. And I can tell you the scientists and engineering and geology scientists that we have, they are always, tweaking with that.So while we can look at spacing, we have to get down and completing the well. That just a constant work in progress, and this is always evolving. And that will never change, I can promise you. Jeff Grampp : Understood. And then kind of more of a housekeeping one if I may. The decks that you guys are kind of building in real time here and we have talked about it couple of times in the call already. Are those weighted to maybe certain operating areas or Midland versus Delaware focused? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. It is really about 70/30 Midland, Delaware and multiple rigs are moving towards Midland basin, where we have a high mineral interest and you know setting ourselves up for the most capital efficient return to work possible. Jeff Grampp : Got it? Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Asit Sen : Thanks. Good morning, I have one for Kaes, one for Travis. Kaes, on counterparties and flow assurance, thanks for all the detail update in the slide deck. My question is there have been some reports on the sea borne market getting backed up. Can you talk directly about the condition of the export market perhaps into the next couple of months? And in terms of take or pay liabilities, could you update us in theory on what happens if there is a physical slow bottleneck in any of these pipes? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I don't know all the details about the sea borne market, but as you know, it is more liquid than what we have seen especially in the last few weeks. So you are certainly starting to see spreads, widening barrels get on the water now, tanker rates certainly spiked a little bit, which would impact our realizations. But they have come back down a little bit here.But overall, the whole point of our marketing arrangement is to provide insurance in times of uncertainty, which we are in right now. And being able to call only four marketers and know that our barrels are going to move is something that allows us to stick a little better at night.On the take or pay fees, 125,000 barrels a day is take or pay from a sales perspective, as well as from a pipeline perspective. Should the sales piece declare force measure, which would be the only instance where those barrels don't move? Our total pipeline commitments right now and [indiscernible] is about, $20 million per pipe per year, if we didn't send one barrel down the pipe. Asit Sen : Thanks, Kaes. Travis on a potential restart scenario, how quickly could you restart operations? What are the price signals? And what are some of the other broader considerations would you consider before adding on regular completion crew? Travis Stice : Well, it should only be driven by economics, right. And so, the first thing we would do is, obviously, get our curtailed volumes back into the production equation, and then following that we will get economics about, what is the service sector is going to charge to come back to work, and then we will balance that against with our expectations are for the forward curve and make an economic decision on that, I think I alluded to some form of start in the high 20s and low 30s.But really if you flash all the way out there to what our world used to look like in growth, that is back the prices that you saw last year. So I think as we evolve as an industry into this new order. I think it is going to look a lot different than what historically we have accustomed to. Asit Sen : I appreciate it. Thanks Travis. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from a lot of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, you and your whole team. Travis Stice : Thank you, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, you have anticipated? I guess my question in your response to your earlier one, I get the point that you guys are prepared for longer scenario, but also it seems from the outside looking in that you guys are more prepared, more on your front foot for a V-shaped recovery. In other words, you are better positioned than other in the industry to go back to work hard in the back half of the year. Is that inaccurate do you think and how would you elaborate on that? Travis Stice : Yes, well first, we are certainly not in the prediction of what recovery is going to look like V-shape or U-shape or whatever. But what we are trying to do is demonstrate flexibility to our investors that whether it is lower, longer, we are prepared for that with our financial strength, or whether the market signals that it is time to go back to work, we are also prepared for that.But again, back to my transparency comment, in these uncertain times, whichever scenario plays out, you can count on us, stepping forward and letting our investors know exactly what we are thinking about the business and the strategic rationale behind the decisions that we make. Charles Meade : Got it. And then may be following up a little bit on that, actually I guess if you are not completing wells right now, but you guys are still going to run a concision crew for part of the quarter and I know you said that is for lease retention or lease obligations consideration.I'm curious I imagine there have been other options you evaluated about going back to the mineral owners and maybe offering up a rental or some other thing. Are there other considerations that are going on that are leading up to compete in 15 or 20 wells or so in 2Q rather than do some of those other lease obligation options? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Charles you know a lot of those wells probably already in progress, heading into the quarter so you can\u2019t have that discussion in a mid completion. We are working with our mineral owners and we happen pretty easy to work with through this given where we are flat price is.So if we can push out whatever we can, whenever we can. We are trying to do that, it is hard to 1,280 acre units, get in touch with 40 mineral owners in a month. But, we have been working diligently to extend leases and extend completion dates. Travis Stice : Yes. Charles, just to add to that the complexity is, unless you are actually inside, it is hard to communicate but I will say it, our land organizations and our land professionals, they are engaged, almost, they engaged every day and feels like a nice light to work on lease terms to avoid, having a drill or completed well and when we are not getting paid for the commodity.So, as Kaes indicated, a lot of our mineral owners understand the business and are trying to make, concessions. But also it is very difficult at times to get everyone on the same page and all it takes is one person to say no, and then your hand is forced. So, really proud of our land organization and the work they are doing says to get us to the point where we are only running one completion through honor minimum obligations this quarter. Charles Meade : Thank you for the detail. Travis Stice : Thanks Charles Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open. Richard Tullis : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Travis, generally how much runway do you have as far as well inventory to continue on the current path where you are drilling the areas with higher NRI and lower infrastructure needs? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Richard, I think we try to be as open as possible and show what our gross from that inventory is on Slide 13 and Slide 14 in deck and we update that every year. And I think one of the benefits of slowing down is you are not burning through as much inventory that quickly.So I think without needing to complete 150, 160 wells keep our production flat 75% of in the Midland basin, you got a pretty long runway of high quality employee, to survive a lower for longer environment. Travis Stice : We have got over 12,000 gross locations still in front of us, Richard and which is slowdown in activity or stoppage in activity, exactly as Kaes said, we are actually extending our inventory runway as a result of completing those wells and adding the license. Richard Tullis : Okay. Thank you. And secondly, you know any plans to resume testing of the limelight acreage in the second half of the year or does that just need to wait for substantially higher oil prices? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, probably the way we are having discussions with the mineral owners right now on extending our delaying our next payer. Richard Tullis : Okay. That is all from me. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you Tullis. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Wangler with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open. Jason Wangler : Hey, good morning. Just had one, and obviously something we have talked a lot about in the past, but it is probably weird now. But as far as you have got plenty of inventory, certainly, but you are in a much better position than so many others around you, as you think about this playing out, and maybe some point getting more impressive. Are you seeing anything that is maybe interesting from the M&A side or maybe how do you just kind of see that playing out as we kind of go forward in this environment? Travis Stice : Yes. Jason, this is all about demonstrating our financial strength and getting to the other side of the recovery. When we are there, when the market signal is there, I think a question has more validity, but right now you know it is doing, what we are doing, which is maximizing cash flow and preserving liquidity. Jason Wangler : Fair enough. I appreciate it. Thank you. Travis Stice : You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy. You line is now open. Michael Hall : Thanks, good morning. I appreciate the time, a lot have been addressed. But, one that is kind of been touched on a little bit but wanted to follow-up on is just in the context of signaling or what sort of price signals are required to get back to kind of quarter-on-quarter gross or move beyond that maintenance capital program in 2021? Number one, what might those prices theoretically look like, it sounds like maybe last year's type of level, but just wanted to confirm that? And then number two, maybe more philosophically like, how are you thinking about the combination of frozen payout from on a longer term basis, is the growth side of that combination, structurally lower than it was a year ago, let's say after what we have just been through, or is it really not affected and it will really just be a function of what prices and returns look like whenever that time comes? Travis Stice : I think our industry is evolving perhaps as a more rapid pace than it ever had. And if we were making changes at the end of last year, as an industry, with a slower growth and a greater return model. And then I've got take in the hyper-speed in March to this year.So, this new oil order as we looked ahead, as we are going to have what feels like, at least today, it is going to feel like a lot lower growth in a more prescriptive way of returning, investments or returning, returns to our investors.And I think it is still going to evolve in the course of this year, but certainly under what is a strip looks like it is going to definitely be a lot lower growth profile. But we want to make sure we maintain a dividend and resume - when you maximize our cash flow, when appropriate the market signals, you have purely growth there - all those t the same at time. Michael Hall : Okay. I mean is it fair to say in a 40 to 50 range all else equal today knowing that all else equal a hard assumption to make but that that is just maybe round about the level that would signal getting back to a quarter-on-quarter growth profile? Travis Stice : Yes. It is more than just the just an oil price. I think I said earlier that if you look at some of the prices that we got in 2019, that certainly signal that you can get more aggressive on the growth, but I think we have got to be pretty careful and being super scripted on what exact price signals may look like before you get back to growth. Again, just want to make sure we maintain our dividends, maximize our cash flow and when it is time to grow, now back we will have few leading growth along with the dividend and maximize cash flow. Michael Hall : Understood, appreciate the color. Travis Stice : Just to finish that part, I kind of went on a little earlier about transparency and I think it is important, again to emphasize here, we are trying to communicate as transparent as we can the way that we see the future, and you can count on us as the future gets clear, we are going to update the market.Like you said, we have done it four times in the last five weeks. And we are going to continue to be communicative and we are going to continue to demonstrate one of the hallmarks of our corporate culture which is transparency, and we will let you know as these things evolve. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Sure, thank you. Listen to before I close this morning, I wanted to share with you guys a final thought. We have all had what feels like an unreasonable amount of time to reflect over the last couple of months as we have worked remotely or sheltered in place. And when I'm not doing that, and looking back into over 35 years I've had in the industry, there is been several significant events that have stood out. The challenger spaceship disaster in 1986, the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, of course, 9/11, and now we are involve in a worldwide pandemic caused by the Coronavirus.But when I look back at those historical events that that I participated in, during those times, there were really two defining attributes that I felt were demonstrated. The first is, is really the resiliency of the American people. Even in the face of human tragedy and financial tragedy, we found a way to move forward.And the second attribute and I think it is important in today's environment is hope, hope that we will get through this and hope that our situation will get better. And so as we get this country back to work, let's count on that resiliency once again. Let's also remind each other the importance of hope. Hope for ourselves, for our kids and our grandkids that tomorrow will be better.Thank you for participating in today's call. Please reach out if you have any questions.

All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Adam Lawlis, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's second quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on our website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found on our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to continue to extend our thoughts and prayers to all of those both directly and indirectly affected by the coronavirus pandemic. This year has brought unprecedented challenges and I'm proud of how our organization responded given the obstacles presented. Our teams reacted quickly to the commodity price volatility and adjusted our operating and capital plans in real time. We are seeing the benefits of this work today with all-time low cash operating costs and capital costs per lateral foot at or below all-time lows in both basins. This is also accompanied by high-graded forward development plan weighted towards the mid-LAN basin where we have high mineral ownership, low midstream and infrastructure capital requirements, and high returns due to the quality of our acreage accompanied by industry low drilling and completion costs. Turning to the second quarter, we dramatically reduced our operated rig count in the second quarter, from 20 rigs on March 31st to six rigs today. In response to historically low commodity prices experienced in the quarter, we made the decision to complete as few wells as possible in the second quarter, with zero wells turned to production in the month of June. We also curtailed 5% of our oil production during the second quarter. This curtailed production has been restored, and is now receiving significantly higher realized prices than it would have received when the decision was made to curtail. We have three completion crews working today to stem production declines and to meet our fourth quarter production target of between 170 and 175,000 barrels of oil per day. Importantly, Diamondback decreased activity levels throughout the second quarter while not spending excessive dollars on early termination fees or other one-time expenses that are headwinds to cash generation. Looking ahead, production is expected to continue to decline in the third quarter, but rise to meet our fourth quarter guidance as we began completion operations in June with two crews and added a third completion crew in July. We expect to run between three and four completion crews for the rest of the year and are currently running six operated drilling rigs which is our base case for the rest of the year. In 2021, should a maintenance capital scenario become the base case, Diamondback can hold fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat, while spending 25% to 35% less than 2020's capital budget, which is also expected to include lower midstream and infrastructure budgets. The second half of 2020 and 2021's capital programs will benefit from the drawdown of some of the DUC build from the first half of 2020 as we worked down our operated rig counts as contracts rolled off. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion of standalone liquidity and have only $191 million of our September 2021 notes outstanding after tendering for 55% of the original $400 million issuance during the second quarter. This was our only major term debt maturity before 2024. With our reduction in forward capital spending, and expectation for true free cash flow generation at current commodity prices in the second half of 2020 and 2021, we will look to reduce both gross and net debt while continuing to return capital to our shareholders through our base dividend. This dividend remains our primary return of capital to our equity holders and the Board of Directors has decided to maintain the dividend based on the current forward outlook. To finish, Diamondback has further adjusted downward our already low cost structure and is prepared to operate successfully in a lower-for-longer oil price environment. A lot of the efficiency and cost gains made during this downturn will become permanent and will benefit Diamondback shareholders in a recovery. Low interest expense, low leverage, industry-leading, low cash operating cost, downside hedge protection, strong midstream contracts, and the benefits of Viper and Rattler will allow Diamondback to operate effectively through an uncertain forward outlook. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Neal Dingmann from [indiscernible]. Your line is now live. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : First question. Travis, for your case, I guess, we've heard a lot this year about how activity and pricing has impacted everybody's free cash flow. But, again, what we've noticed for you all, and you mentioned this in the press release several times that your costs have come down notably again in 2Q. So, my question is how your cost control sets you up for free cash flow generation better as it appears to me your outspend is now behind you all. Travis Stice : Certainly, I agree the outspend is behind us. As I articulated the third quarter, fourth quarter, and throughout next year, we'll be generating significant free cash flow. The cost structure remains one of Diamondback's significant advantages. You've heard me say before that our main focus is to convert resource into cash flow at the most efficient margin while we drill and complete really good wells. The cost savings and the cost reductions that we're seeing right now through this downturn, we believe that a high percentage of those will continue throughout the forward development plan. Historically, when you go through a cycle, you'll see service cost concessions of 10% to 15%. We're now down over 25% over the last 12 months. As long as rig count stays below 200 rigs out here in the Permian and commodity price stays sort of range bound where it is right now, we feel pretty confident that the execution and cost metrics that we're seeing today will be part of our future operating plan. Neal Dingmann : Leads me to the second one just on that plan, I was wondering, on the future activity cadence and leverage, specifically you guys have now mentioned a couple times that you can keep '21 activity flattish with, I think you've said now, 25% less cost. So, the question would be, if prices stay about at today\u2019s level into next year or maybe even go a little bit higher, would you still potentially keep activity levels flattish and cut debt or how would you think about it? Certainly, it sounds like you have the ability with these costs to come in a little bit better. So, I'm just wondering if prices do rally a little bit, as all others seem to be cutting productions out there. What's the thought of tackling debt or looking a little bit more at activity? Travis Stice : Certainly, we're not seeing any signals that growth is needed from Diamondback or from our industry in general. So, growth in today's world is pretty much off the table. The comments I made in my prepared remarks echoing the board's viewpoint that we're going to - our primary form of return to our shareholders is in the form of our dividend, and our board's committed to maintaining that dividend, and hopefully growing that into the future as well. Beyond that, excess free cash flow, as I said, we\u2019ll be using to reduce debt. So, I think it's a combination of both continue to lean into the dividend and also reduce total debt and net debt at the same time. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neal, I think we're really focused on this Q4 exit rate number on an oil of 170,000 to 175,000 barrels a day and maintaining that number in 2021 with the lowest capital required, whether that\u2019s on the midstream side, the infrastructure side, as well as the DC&E side. So, we're continuing to refine that and put some guideposts around 2021. But as Travis said, growth isn't top of mind today; instead, it's how capital efficient can we be to keep that production flat in 2021. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Derrick Whitfield : I wanted to follow-up on Neal's first question. Perhaps for yourself, Travis, or Danny. Could you speak to the repeatability of your recent operational records with the completion of the Spanish Trail four-wall pad 10.5 days and the horizontal well you drilled in 8,000-foot in 24 hours? And if possible, help us kind of quantify the savings associated with that degree of efficiency versus your average well. And, Travis, we understand that every well can't be a pacesetter well, but we're just trying to get a feel for the degree of cost savings and how repeatable that could be for you guys in the future. Travis Stice : Yes, Derrick, Danny is in the room this morning and I\u2019m going to let Danny answer those specifics. Daniel Wesson : Yes. First, on the kind of repeatability point on the completion side, I mean, really, that's a kind of an operational procedural change from one of our service providers and a new kind of way of attacking zipper completion. So, that's repeatable on each pad we go to that we have those simultrack crews rigged up on. It's certainly something we anticipate going forward. And then as far as on the drilling side, the 8,000-foot in 24 hours, while that's a leading-edge kind of metric and it's a basin record and a Diamondback record, I don't expect us to be beating records on every well that we drill, but certainly, we'll keep edging closer to those types of results. And while that's the leading edge marker, maybe the midpoint moves closer to that and as we continue to utilize the technology that our partners are bringing us and start pushing the bounds of what we can do. Travis Stice : And then I think, Derrick, on the cost side, the completion crew that completes two wells at once and can - did that Spanish trail pad, you\u2019re paying more for the horsepower, but you're also saving a lot of money on the variable costs. So, you're probably saving somewhere in the range of $20 or $25 a foot. And I think tangentially, that benefits areas where you have high water out or high production. You're watering out your production for a lot shorter period of time and getting that production back online. So, that's a crew that we're going to use in areas where we have a lot of existing production throughout the basin. Derrick Whitfield : As my second question, I'd like to shift to the evolving regulatory environment. Perhaps for you, Travis. You've correctly outlined your minimal exposures to federal land as a potential competitive advantage in the event there is non-supportive legislation with permits and/or fracking. With the understanding that you guys are one of the more progressive E&P companies on ESG matters and are not exposed to federal lands, could you speak to your greatest regulatory concerns in the current environment? Travis Stice : Yes, sure, Derrick. It's a lot of - we don't have a lot of clarity on what this - what the regulatory environment is going to look like if we fast forward to an administration change. But what we do know is that it won't speed up. Things won't become more efficient. And so, what we're trying to do is be as much on our front foot on things that require regulatory approval. Now, you've just echoed, and we have articulated, that our - we have essentially no exposure to federal acreage, but we're going to see what the new rules of engagement are, should they get rolled out. And you can expect Diamondback like you said to be progressive in the way that we navigate through those new rules of engagement. Listen, we support sound science that drives regulation. And you've heard me say that before in our sustainability report. And we'll continue to support regulation that's backed by sound science. When those two things deviate is where Diamondback and our industry are likely going to have a problem with the regulation. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead please. Scott Hanold : Thanks. You all in your presentation, on pages I guess 10 and 11, provide your current inventory. And you do have that economic sensitivity. And it looks like the Midland Basin is pretty resilient in this assessment, down to at least $40 to $45 a barrel. Could you give us some sense of what causes that resiliency? Is it the current well costs and maybe if you can give a little bit of color around that inventory, where you think that relative, I guess I'll call quality is, versus what you've drilled to date and maybe versus what you see with - compared to other peers? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Scott. I think it's misunderstood how good our Midland Basin inventory is. I'd kind of put our Midland Basin inventory particularly with our cost structure, up against anybody. And that's just proven based on the numbers. So, with current well costs below $600 a foot on the Midland Basin side, we have a significant runway of quality inventory ahead of us. I think we wanted to get ahead of that discussion topic, which seems to poke its head out once in a while. So really, on the Midland Basin side, putting zero dollars of value on the gas side at $35 a barrel, you have over 3,000 locations economic today. And I think that that speaks to the quality of inventory and the cost structure behind that inventory. Scott Hanold : Yes. And I guess my specific question would be - and you talked about well costs and you obviously have a royalty rate advantage, but can you talk maybe about the like EUR and productivity, say relative to say some of your peers? Or is it really the cost and the royalty advantage? Kaes Van' t Hof : It's really a combination. Some of our peers, mostly the peers that are larger than us that have a significant amount of inventory, they're spacing their wells wider and doing bigger frac jobs, so they're getting a little more EUR per foot, but the costs are higher. We've tended to space our wells relatively tighter at eight wells across, 660-foot spacing in the Midland Basin, and that's partially due to the completion design being a little bit smaller frac job, but also the costs being lower, and therefore getting a little lower EUR per foot, but from a returns perspective, you\u2019re drilling and completing those wells for multiple hundred dollars per foot cheaper. Scott Hanold : And then my follow-up question is on the conversation of maintenance spending into next year. How many wells does it take to maintain your production? And to maintain that 170 to 175 on the oil side, would your oil cuts stay flat? I mean, what does your oil cut do through like 2021 on a maintenance plan? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think oil cut comes up a little bit from where it was in the second quarter because of the curtailments, but we're probably still somewhere in the low-60s now. Our maintenance plan in 2021 is moving more and more towards the Midland Basin. So, that probably means a few more wells than if you were 50/50 Midland Delaware. But I think something similar to our gross operated well count this year with two-thirds or more focused on the Midland Basin is kind of where our head is at. And I think, as we're doing our work right now to refine that analysis and refine that 25% to 35% less capital number, we'll update the market when we have that data. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Your line is now live. Go ahead please. Gail Nicholson : You guys have had a nice improvement in LOE. Can you just talk about how you think LOE trends physically in the back half of 2020, and then more importantly in 2021 and what drivers you have done to gain that further improvement? Travis Stice : Yes, Gail, really, credit to the team and the field organization who went from ramping up in April to curtailing in May and bringing back that curtailed production in June to keep LOE as low as it did in the second quarter, below $4. I think that, naturally, that number is going to come up a little bit in Q3 and Q4. But still probably be somewhere in the lower half of the force. Then, as we think about the next year, our large capital spend on the infrastructure side in terms of electrification of some fields as well as going to gas foot projects will help LOE stay in that kind of low 4's range as we head into 2021. And every cent at current production is about $1 million a year of cash flow. So, we're picking up pennies and going to stay focused on being as close to that $4 bogie as we can. Gail Nicholson : And then, in \u201821, your take-or-pay obligations or firm sales increased with the start-up of Wink to Webster. I was just kind of curious how you guys are thinking about price realization expectations in '21 per percent of WTI and the importance of having that exposure to Brent as we move forward in time? Travis Stice : I think the exposure to Brent stays about the same 2020 to 2021, about 60%. But once Wink to Webster comes on, that contract moves from a Midland-based price to MEH-based price. I think our mentality there, the thought process is these types of commitments and the long-term sales agreements are essentially large insurance policies for when things go bad. And right now, with Brent WTI as narrow as it is, we're probably losing a few cents versus selling those barrels in Midland. But if Brent WTI blows out to $4 or $5 a barrel, then we're probably receiving somewhere close to 100% of WTI. Operator : Your next question will come from the line Asit Sen from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Asit Sen : The DUC count of 110 to 140 at year end \u201820 and you talked about drawing those, what's a good way to think about a normal DUC level in this scenario? And if you could - I know it's a little early, if I'm thinking about maintenance capital in 2022 at current strip, how should we conceptually think about Midland, Delaware split and capital needs for infrastructure? Travis Stice : I'll take the second part first, Asit. I think, overall, infrastructure is - the line that we define as infrastructure will be cut almost in half going into 2021 and I think that number, we've had a large infrastructure build across our position over the last three or four years and there's a lot of scrutiny on that number to not come back up. As we have executed on our one-time projects on electrification and gas lift, and we have very few new batteries to build, instead we expand our existing batteries, that infrastructure budget is going to keep being driven down. Even in 2022, that's a long way from today. But I think our goal is to try to be at least two thirds Midland Basin-weighted for the foreseeable future. And whether that's in a growth or a stay-flat scenario, I think we have the inventory to do that. Asit Sen : And then my follow-up question is on the ESU front. Travis, you emphasized the ESG, and on slide 20 flaring as a percent of net production has come down pretty nicely year-over-year. Could you talk about strategies enabling this? Again, remind us on the compensation metrics as it relates to ESG? Travis Stice : Yes, specifically, our field organization and operations organization jumped ahead and took advantage of some of the slowdown in our drilling activity to kind of get caught up on some of the Diamondback-required drilling and completion operations, particularly in the Delaware Basin. In some instances, we brought our balance sheet to bear, where we spent dollars to eliminate flaring, but it's essentially across the board a high emphasis to not flare at all. And we do need, at times, help from our gathering partners to make sure that once we're hooked up that that can move the gas. But in general, we've adopted a policy of every well is connected to a gas sales point before it's brought on. And that, plus working closely with our gathering and processing partners, has allowed us to really substantially reduce our flaring. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, and, also, we haven't taken the matter into our own hands by converting some of these legacy contracts that we had from POP, percent of proceeds, over the 100% fixed fee. And that's what's driving our gathering and transportation costs going up by a little bit this quarter. Now, we catch the benefit of that on the realized price side on the gas front, so it's really a neutral trade. And the higher gas goes up, the more we're exposed to that on the Diamondback side. So, using the legal and the contract route to incentivize our gatherers and processors on a fixed fee basis to take our gas. Travis Stice : And we've got - in fact, you can read it on Slide 21, some of the changes we made to our short-term incentive compensation program. And as a reminder, this scorecard, this corporate scorecard that we present in our proxy, that makes up half of every employees' short-term incentive compensation on an annual basis. So, we've got a 15% weighting on our ES&G measures. And you can see what those are on Slide 21. Listed there, safety metrics, our flaring, greenhouse gas emissions, the percent of recycled water, oil spill control and TRIR or total recordable incident rate. There's five measures that make up that ES&G score now. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Grampp of Northland Securities. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Jeff Grampp : You guys have communicated pretty clearly, an aspiration to reduce debt here on an absolute relative basis over the next few quarters. So, I was wondering if you guys had targeted either an absolute or relative level on the debt side that you guys would want to get to before assessing and increasing returns to shareholders. Travis Stice : Jeff, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. We've raised our dividend every year since putting it in place three years ago and I think that being the primary return of capital, we're going to look at that very closely at the end of the year and see what 2021 holds on that front. The one consistent theme we received from our largest shareholders over the past few months is to protect the dividend and in exchange for protecting that dividend, cut capital. And that's what I think we're going do. I think overall, we would like our debt to be lower than higher. And I don't want to put out a two year or five-year target on that front because a lot can change in this business, as you've seen in the last three months. But I do want to also emphasize that at the parent company, we still have three companies right? And each of those companies has debt that's manageable. All three companies will be generating free cash flow starting in the third quarter going forward. And on top of that, Diamondback has a lot of ownership in those two subsidiaries which while you can't sell all that in a day, at some point that is a safety valve for how much debt you think you have at the parent company. Jeff Grampp : My follow-up, Travis, wanted to pick your brain on the M&A front, maybe from a couple angles. First, just generally, your comfort level at taking a serious look at any deals in this environment? And second is just any level of interest in terms of diversifying the asset base outside of the Permian? Do you see benefits to that from Diamondback's perspective? Or do you think it's more of a competitive advantage to have the concentration and the knowledge space that you have in the Permian? Travis Stice : Look, in terms of the first part of your question, M&A, we are so internally focused right now on doing the things that we need to do. Look, our industry's been rightly criticized for all kinds of noise that have distracted from returns and our focus right now is singularly trying to deliver the highest returns and cash flow for every single dollar we invest. And look, from the public guys, the debt's trading so poorly for the public guys that could potentially be targets, it just doesn't make any sense for us right now. So, that's kind of my view on M&A. And then, I just don't think that it makes sense for Diamondback to be looking at other basins. One of the core philosophies we talk about here is know what you're good at. And Diamondback is really, really good at Permian Basin extraction of hydrocarbons. And that's borne out by our cost structure and our execution metrics. And that's our - that\u2019s our emphasis. That's what we're good at; that's what we know we're good at and that's what we're going to maintain. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of [indiscernible] from JPMorgan. Your line is now live; go ahead, please. Unidentified Analyst : Travis, your guidance implies a - call it a 60/40 split in footage between the Midland Delaware Basins this year. I was wondering if you could give us maybe some more thoughts on how that mix could look as we head into the back half of the year and perhaps any preliminary thoughts on 2021. Travis Stice : Sure. I'm going to let Kaes answer that. He's got a spreadsheet in front of him. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. The 60/40 really is driven by a lot of the first half of the year being in the Delaware Basin. And looking to back half of the year, Q3, Q4 and into 2021, we\u2019ve really moved the rig schedule on the frac schedule to about 70/30 Midland Delaware. While I don't have my spreadsheet in front of me, that's kind of the path forward is let's get more focused on the Midland Basin where we have less infrastructure needs, less midstream needs, lower LOE, and probably better returns in our overall cost structure. So, I think for us, six rigs operating, four of them are in the Midland and two in the Delaware. Unidentified Analyst : And, Kaes, if you were going to characterize what the spread and call it and oil breakeven is today, kind of using some of your leading-edge well cost, what would you say the spread is? Kaes Van' t Hof : I'd say it's less than $5, but somewhere around $5 a barrel. Your breakeven in the Midland a little bit lower than the Delaware. I just think if you're running $5.75 or $5.80 as your cost per lateral foot, that's a pretty good return in project with some of these Midland Basin wells in the 80, 90, 100 barrels a foot EUR range. Unidentified Analyst : And just my follow-up, quite a few of incoming questions just on next year's CapEx thoughts. Obviously, you released this a couple - two, three weeks ago, but just the 25% to 35% of decline per year to keep 4Q oil flat, you did highlight some lower infrastructure costs, but what type of well cost is kind of embedded within that range? Are you using basically the 2020 updated outlook for well costs? But maybe just a little bit of color on that would be helpful. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I don't think we would use the 2020 updated outlook, the real-time cost to drive that number. We're really kind of using the lower end of our full-year 2020 guidance range. We - I think Travis mentioned earlier in the call, well costs are down 25% year-over-year, probably 50% of that is service-cost related. I think for us to guide to all-time low well costs in 2021 would not be a prudent idea. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Jeanine Wai : My first question is following up on some of the prior ones on productivity and activity allocation. Can you tell us how you anticipate the corporate-wide productivity per foot to trend in 2021 relative to 2020? And I guess we're asking because I know that there's been some change recently and there's some preference between high-grading zones in a more modest price environment versus more co-development versus kind of needs retention. Travis Stice : Well, I think, Jeanine, overall, with more Midland Basin as a higher percentage of your total capital, your Midland Basin EUR per foot is lower than the Delaware, but your well costs are significantly lower. So, while I can't give you an exact productivity on well EUR per foot, I do think, in general, the couple hundred wells we\u2019re going to complete in 2021 will be a higher productivity on returns basis than 2020 because in 2020 we were heading into the year to complete 350 wells and we've - we've slowed that machine down to complete 185 this year and something close to that next year. And I think just, in general, our next if 80, 85 wells I see on the schedule for the second half of 2020 are significantly better than the first half of 2020, and we expect that level of detail on drilling our best stuff first to carry into 2021. Jeanine Wai : My second question is just back on CapEx. I know you pre-released the updated production and CapEx guide. Last night, you provided the helpful breakout between the different components, which were kind of reset to the higher end. Not to rehash old news or anything like that, but I still think that there's a lot of questions on some of the moving pieces on that 2020 update. Especially on the D&C side, given you're completing the same amount of net wells you previously planned and exiting with some less DUCs. Maybe color there for some clarification would be helpful. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Sure Jeanine. I think what's unique about how Diamondback reports CapEx is that it's a number that actually matches the cash flow statement. And sometimes that's been to our detriment, particularly in the first half of the year. So, in general, we came into the year running 23 rigs and eight completion crews and we're going to exit the year running five or six rigs and three or four completion crews. And that results in a net cash outflow and a cash drag of $250 or $300 million on the budget. I think for others who report a crude CapEx that doesn't match their cash flow statement, we, on an activity-based basis, are going to do 155 to 16 of capital this year with a large cash outflow drag heading into next year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBank. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Leo Mariani : Want to follow-up a little bit on the cost side. Certainly, looking at your leading edge well costs that you guys are talking about in your slide deck in both the Midland and Delaware, certainly those appear to be below your 2020 guidance in terms of costs per foot. Just trying to get a sense there, do you think kind of the full year \u201820 Midland and Delaware DC&E well cost per foot guide might end up being a little bit conservative, or are you kind of maybe being a little reluctant to change things sort of mid-year here? Travis Stice : I think we're reluctant to change it just because half the year's gone, and the way we report CapEx, probably three quarters of the year is essentially gone on well-cost perspective. But these lower well costs that we're seeing today in real time will benefit the company in the fourth quarter and into 2021. So, I think it's prudent for us not to change that guidance. But certainly, we expect the trend to continue. Leo Mariani : And I guess, clearly, you guys are very focused, it seems to be, on maintenance mode in a $40 oil world and rightfully so. Travis, you certainly talked about not having the right signals in this current environment to really indicate for anyone in the industry to pursue production growth. I guess, what do you think the right signals might be for the FANG and U.S. industry in general to start thinking about production growth? Travis Stice : You've got to have a lot higher commodity price. I don't know what higher means, but certainly materially higher than what you see today. You also have to have access to capital, which right now's been - there's been capital starvation for a number of quarters for our industry. And rightfully so, as I mentioned earlier, because of our industry's inability to generate through returns but the last part of that would be - certainly, investor sentiment would have to change dramatically from where it sits today. There's quite a bet of headwinds, I think, for our industry as you look ahead to try to think about any kind of meaningful production growth. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, Kaes, and the whole team there. I wanted to ask, Travis, this goes back to a comment you made earlier in response to one of your earlier questions about the rig count staying under 200 in service costs. If we go back to the end of last week, a couple of the bigger operators out there, two majors, I think everyone expected them to be dropping rigs, but they really indicated that they're going to be dropping quickly or dropping a lot of rigs into your end. And I'm curious, as you look toward the back half of \u201820 and into \u201821, as that rig count continues to go down, how do you see things changing for you as an operator? Or maybe just in your environment in the greater ecosystem out there? Travis Stice : Well, certainly if we continue to have this environment, as I mentioned earlier, well costs are usually going to stay the same or they're going to go lower. And I think it's reasonable, if commodity prices increase, you'll start to see the service sector - the service sector responds. But look, the Permian Basin is going through a seismic shift in a capital allocation from all the operators, and you can see it in the production responses. We're now below 4 million barrels of oil a day of production. And so, it's just hard to see, in this environment, any meaningful change in the current operating situation that all the companies are faced with here in the Permian. Charles Meade : Got it, that's it from me. Thank you. Travis Stice : Yes and Charles, just to add to that though, with this continued reduction in activity, and even in this environment. I can't emphasize enough that Diamondback's clear advantage is not only the number of locations we have that we laid out in our slides in terms of inventory, but it's our cost structure. And so, and - the lower the price of the commodity goes and the more the margins get squeezed, the more really efficient, high-margin companies get highlighted. And certainly Diamondback, as evidenced by numbers in this release, falls into that category. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live sir. Go ahead, please. Brian Singer : Can you talk to how this year and the run-up to this year have changed your views, if at all, longer term on the oil price on the right amount of production to hedge? And then, if we are in a lower Diamondback plus industry growth environment in the Permian, the strategic value of your interests in Viper and Rattler? Travis Stice : Brian, the - Kaes mentioned earlier about how Diamondback has a large ownership position in both our subs, and that continues to literally and figuratively pay dividends to Diamondback shareholders. And it's something the Diamondback board is aware of, but it's - we're comfortable in our position in our ownership of those subs today. You want to add anything to that, Kaes? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, I think on the hedging side, most of our hedges we structured as two-way callers. And so, we had a slide in our deck where we are exposed to the upside here and we have a good amount of 2021 production hedged. We haven't added - much on that front. We've actually restructured and lowered the total exposure in 2021. But overall, I think we\u2019re moving towards a true free cash flow model that distributes a lot of cash to shareholders. Diamondback should emulate what Viper and Rattler have done over the past couple of years, which is distribute a lot of cash back - back to their shareholders, one being Diamondback. But more hedging, I think, is probably in our future and making sure your dividend is protected on the bottom end and you print a bunch of free cash on the top end of those two-way callers. Brian Singer : And then my follow-up is what are you seeing from outside operators in the Permian? And if oil prices do rise, do you have a sense if the level of discipline from the onsite operators will be lower or greater than your own? Travis Stice : Well, certainly our industry doesn't have a good track record of that discipline. But I believe that there has been a change in sea level in terms of discipline. And I'm confident that all operators, that at least have any awareness of our industry, are going to be very judicious in trying to resume activities that generate production growth. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please. Michael Hall : Appreciate the time. I just wanted to do, I guess follow-up on one thing and then also ask I guess, on base declines maybe first on the declines. I'm just curious, as you guys have slowed down a bit here this year. How do you think about the impact of that on the base decline profile as you look at 2021 exiting 2020, entering 2021, relative to how things look exiting 2019 heading into 2020? What's the change in base decline rate there? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes Michael, on the oil side, we released - high 30s was our base decline exiting 2019 going into 2020. I think that probably goes somewhere into the mid-30s. I can't guarantee the low-30s yet, but probably the mid-30s on at least on oil. So, probably 300 bps or 400 bps of benefit, on the BOE side, we were at low 30s, kind of 32, 33 this year, 2019 going into 2020 and that probably goes down in a couple of hundred bps lower into the - near the 30% range. Michael Hall : And I guess the follow-up was on the M&A commentary. It seemed like maybe Travis, you were referring to the public space in that commentary. I just wanted to follow-up, is your view that M&A doesn't really make sense? Is that applicable in both public and the private space or is it worth differentiating between the two at this point? Travis Stice : Well, it's all about the rock, right. So I mean, if you find good rock, you shouldn't care whether it's public or private. But the problem that we're seeing on the public side is how poorly the debt's trading for public companies. And that adds a significant detriment on acreage valuation. On the private side, there's just not that many opportunities out there truthfully of Tier 1 acreage. We're not going to - there's just not a lot of Tier 1 rock that's out there and that's kind of how we differentiate it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Richard Tullis from Capital One Securities. Your line is now live, sir. Go ahead, please. Richard Tullis : Kaes, it was mentioned a couple times that the dividend is the primary vehicle for returning cash to shareholders. Just wanted to get your thoughts on potentially Diamondback implementing say, a variable dividend that paid out a certain percentage of excess cash flow yearly? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes I mean, Richard my opinion is, I've heard a lot of talk about the variable dividend. And the only variable dividend I've ever seen is at Viper in our space. But for us, the fixed dividend is the priority. And I think in the conversations with our larger shareholders, they want to be running, kind of, a dividend growth model as how they're getting cash back from their investment in Diamondback. And I think overall, it's a good concept, but it's just not a concept that we're focused on right now. We're focused on the base dividend, which in our peer group has the highest yield today. And I think investors\u2019 knowing that's safe is important and knowing that that's going to grow in the future is also important. Richard Tullis : Sure. And then just as a follow-up, looking at the base case 2021 budget of around six rigs, maybe for Travis or Danny, do you envision allocation of some level of capital in that scenario to continue testing your acreage, such as going back to the limelight area or other intervals? Travis Stice : There might be a little bit in there, Richard but it's going to be as muted as possible. I think given the shocks that the industry's gone through over the last four months just exemplifies how precious capital is. And I think a lot of our landowners have been pretty accommodating through this. And we're going to do what we can to hold acreage, but also to only drill our best stuff with the majority of the capital. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes Richard, we remain singularly focused on delivering the highest returns and cash flow per share for each dollar that's invested. And every capital allocation decision that we make runs through that aperture and we'll be consistent with that on a go forward basis. Operator : Thank you, sir. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Mr. Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Stay well. Operator : Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",

I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Victor. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Third Quarter 2020 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice . Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. Diamondback continued with our trend of cost reductions in the third quarter, with LOE and G&A remaining near all-time lows and capital cost per lateral foot continuing to decline to new records. Our drilling and completion operations continued to gain efficiencies and current well costs are now 30% lower than 2019 levels in both the Midland and Delaware Basin. We're also beginning to see the benefits from high grading our development programs since the downturn started in our latest well results and have all of the impact of curtailments from the second quarter in the rearview mirror.  As a result of this high grading and improved capital efficiency, we're on track to meet our fourth quarter average oil production target of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels per day and expect to carry this momentum into 2021 as the baseline for our maintenance capital development plan in 2021. We expect to execute on this capital plan with 25% to 35% less capital than 2020. And this plan implies a reinvestment ratio of about 70% at $40 oil. To be clear, this maintenance capital scenario is currently the base case for our operations through the end of 2021. But if commodity prices weaken further and sustain that weakness for an extended period, we will exhibit capital discipline and industry leadership by cutting capital and activity levels further.  The conversation on industry has moved towards touting reinvestment ratios and corporate breakevens, but has shifted away from answering the question of whether or not an operator's development plan is generating sufficient returns and creating net present value for that company's shareholders. While our 2021 corporate maintenance capital breakeven of low 30s WTI before paying our dividend should be considered best-in-class, that scenario will not happen. If we're operating at or near breakeven we will be spending less than maintenance capital to preserve upside for our shareholders and will instead need to conserve cash flow to pay our dividend and to pay down debt.  Put very simply, our forward capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We will protect our dividend, spend maintenance capital at most and use excess free cash flow to pay down debt. If our expected free cash flow will not cover our dividend, then we will cut capital to ensure our dividend is protected.  The third quarter of 2020 provided a preview of this new operating model as we generated $153 million of consolidated free cash flow in the quarter, most of which was used to reduce consolidated net debt by $137 million. Looking ahead, we have only one material term debt maturity due in the next 4 years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note by early 2021 to further reduce absolute debt. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until the end of 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due in 2025 that's currently callable providing optionality for future gross debt reduction.  Turning briefly to ESG. Diamondback is committed to environmental stewardship and delivering best-in-class performance and reducing our carbon footprint. While owning and operating assets that are positioned on the low end of the global oil cost of supply curve is most important to our stockholders, we recognize it's also important to own and operate assets that are also positioned on the low end of the greenhouse gas emissions cost of supply curve. Diamondback supports public policies that eliminate routine flaring as long as those policies protect the safety of our operations and consider flaring contributions from all segments of the oil and gas industry.  Upstream and midstream operators must continue to work together to address the flaring issue for our industry. Diamondback has been proactive in reducing our flaring by using our balance sheet to build infrastructure to ensure every development well completed is ready to be connected to each respective midstream gatherer. And we will not flow back a well, if that's not the case.  We've also restructured gathering and processing contracts at our expense by converting contracts from a persona proceeds contract to a fixed fee contract so the gatherer does not have an economic excuse not to take our gas. This puts all of the commodity exposure on us as the operator, but ensures that our gas is not flared. Flaring was responsible for over 50% of Diamondback's Scope 1 emissions in 2019.  With flaring per net BOE produced down 54% year-to-date, our Scope 1 emissions have materially declined this year, demonstrating our commitment to environmental responsibility. Next, on the topic of industry consolidation and M&A, we believe that consolidation in our sector is necessary as our sector is too fragmented, but that's changed rapidly. Industry consolidation has long been anticipated in U.S. shale and has been touted as an avenue to create scale and improve cost efficiencies. Today, Diamondback is a leader in cost and efficiency. The success of the acquisitions we've executed to date were largely driven by realizing hundreds of millions of dollars of savings through lower costs and higher returns than from the previous operators. A well drilled in the Permian Basin by Diamondback today will be quicker, less expensive and operated with the lowest cost structure in the business. So we do not need to increase our scale to further reduce our cost structure. We produced 300,000 barrels per day at the lowest cash and capital costs in the industry. We also have an investment-grade balance sheet with a proven access to capital even through this pandemic. There's not a piece of the supply chain that would be better for Diamondback if we were bigger than we are today for midstream contracts to service availability to access to capital. These facts should prove to investors that we have the scale necessary to compete in this industry. Touting and arbitrary numbers such as a level of production our market cap deemed to be relevant in our space is both specious and self-serving. This commentary is only coming from companies with those arbitrary characteristics and is not based in fact or proven through operational metrics.  Diamondback is not getting left behind if we don't do anything today, and we prefer not to make rash decisions at the bottom of the cycle. Patience will be rewarded at the end of the day, and we have the balance sheet, cost structure and asset-based -- asset base to be patient and ride out this downturn as brutal as it may be. Getting bigger does not always translate to getting better. Better is what should matter to shareholders. and better does not mean that financial metrics are improved in that first year. Better means the acquirer adds inventory that competes for capital right away at a relative value that's accretive to the acquirer shareholders, not the targets. Whether the transaction is an MOE or selling the company or buying something, the transaction must translate to being better for our shareholders who own the company. If that is the case, then that's what we'll do.  To finish, we operate in a cyclical business. And while this downturn has been as severe as any in industry history, Diamondback has the size, scale, balance sheet, asset quality and cost structure to weather a prolonged downturn and thrive in the inevitable upcycle. We are generating and expect to continue to generate free cash flow, and we will allocate that free cash flow to our dividend and debt reduction until commodity prices meaningfully recover from current levels.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : . Our first question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Arun Jayaram : Travis, it's clear from your commentary that you believe you have sufficient scale to effectively compete in the Permian without M&A. That being said, I was wondering if you could give us your views on the A&D market? Because it does appear to be what several of your peers have characterized as a buyer's market. We saw a natural gas deal, obviously, not in the Permian, which was recently transacted at a PV17 valuation. So maybe just start with your thoughts on what you're seeing in the A&D market? Travis Stice : Well, let me just circle back to -- you reemphasized my point on scale. There's not a single service company that's calling us up and saying, hey, you're not big enough. We're not going to be able to do business with you. I think we've laid out a pretty good case for how you should think about Diamondback in terms of size and scale and balance sheet and execution metrics. But as it pertains to M&A, it's hard for me to forecast M&A. I think you got to go back and just focus on the words that I said, we're going to grow our asset base just like we've always done, only when it -- we can show that we can drive shareholder value. And that has been the same since the -- in October of 2012 when we took the company public, that's what we come in to work for thinking about every day, is how can we drive shareholder value. And if it comes through execution or it comes through M&A, that's what we'll do. Arun Jayaram : And just my follow-up is one of the drivers of the reduction in your cash cost guidance was lower LOE. And I think that some of that, Travis, has been a shift towards gas lift from ESPs. I was just wondering maybe if you could articulate how your artificial lift strategy has evolved and any implications for go-forward LOE and decline rates? Travis Stice : Sure. I'm really proud of our operations organization. And particularly, this skill set on gas lift really came through the legacy Energen folks, and it's a tribute to those guys. They showed us how we could accomplish our lift mechanism using gas lift as opposed to what Diamondback's legacy operation practice was with ESPs. Now we still have a lot of ESPs in the ground. But we've been making a fundamental shift in going from ESPs to gas lift, and we're seeing a significant reduction in cost savings.  And at the same time, we're not seeing any detrimental impact on performance, so something we're really excited about. And I mean, if you just step all the way back from it, these ESPs, while it's pretty easy just to crank the wrist up or down in response to volume needs. At the end of the day, you're hanging an electric motor in water, 1.5 mile on the ground with an extension cord, and there's nothing but bad things can happen in that scenario.  So there's still going to be a part of our operating plan, ESPs will be. But we're really excited about some of the leading-edge technologies we're deploying with gas lift. And listen, just on the expense side, our focus has always been to be the lowest cost operating in Permian basin. But we've got an organization that understands that for every $0.01 that we save in costs, whether it's LOE or G&A, that translates to $1 million of cash flow that we can return to shareholders or whatever.  So when you have a mindset that's focused on pennies, from the Boardroom, out to our field organization, that's how you ultimately end up driving best-in-class cost structures, which is what Diamondback consistently delivers on. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Curious, you referenced the high grading benefits that you're seeing right now on execution of this 2020 plan. Can you talk about how you see high grading influencing '21 plan? You sort of pegged this free cash flow at $525 million at $40. Are you seeing further benefits going into '21 from high grading? And how long, I guess, as you think about -- you emphasize the scale that Diamondback has, how long do you think you could sustain at a maintenance level this high graded program for? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, David, I think we made some very tough decisions at the end of Q1 and into Q2 as we ramped down from 23 rigs to 5 today. While we did that, we did move the drill schedule to higher Midland basin percentage of total capital. We've kind of put the worst of our lease obligations behind us in the Delaware Basin and now can focus on drilling and completing our best stuff first. And while you're in a world where we're completing 350 wells a year and running 23 rigs, that might be a little more difficult than today, when we're running 6 rigs and completing less than 200 wells a year. So finally seeing the well results and the productivity improvements from moving to a higher Midland basin percentage of capital combined with high Viper interest, as you saw in the Viper results for this quarter and lower midstream and infrastructure spend.  So all that results in a little more capital efficiency, and I think a nice setup from a well result rate of change story heading into next year. And then on your second comment, how long can we sustain that? I think we've been as transparent as anybody in this industry on what our location count looks like. We've had it in our decks for the last 3 years and with well costs coming down to where they are today, our Midland Basin productivity can stay at or above 2021 levels for a multiple -- multiyear period. I don't know what the exact number of years is. It depends on what happens with oil price and activity, but we're confident we can stay flat with less capital going forward as decline rates come down and productivity goes up. Travis Stice : David, I can tell you from my chair and looking at this kind of 2/3 Midland Basin, 1/3 Delaware or 3/4, 25%, that capital allocation looking out for the next, I don't know, four to six quarters, I'm as confident in our forward plan as I've ever been. I mean we're really fired on all cylinders, on execution, on cost reductions and very confident in this forward plan to be able to deliver what our shareholders expect. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that. And just my follow-up is on the '21 plan. I think you mentioned midstream and infrastructure spending coming down next year. Can you clarify those comments a little bit more and maybe talk about some of the benefits or value creation you see evolving out of Viper and Rattler back to FANG holders? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, David. So you know what, I think we've kind of said that midstream and infrastructure will be down another 50% or so next year from this year's levels. And that -- if you look back to two years ago, that's about 25% or 30% of the levels that we had in 2019. So all of that's coming down. It allows us to spend more capital on the drill bit versus the easy ancillary stuff that does have a benefit and does reduce our cost structure.  But with the slowdown, we're not having to add a lot of disposal capacity or oil gathering capacity or a lot of new batteries because we're utilizing our existing infrastructure efficiently. So looking forward to that continuing to decrease. And then as you mentioned, on the Viper and Rattler side, those 2 businesses are still very strategic to us. They provide a lot of free cash flow up to the parent in the form of distributions. Both of them are fine from a leverage perspective. And therefore, you're going to get more cash up to the parent in 2021 from those 2 companies than even 2020. Travis Stice : David, I just want to circle back on your question of inventory. Kaes articulated that we're only going to burn maybe 150 wells per year on the Midland Basin side of things. That translates to years of future inventory. When I talked about confidence in the next several quarters, that doesn't mean that I'm not confident in the next several years. I'm -- we've got 350,000 acres here in the Permian. And the slower we go, the more towards maintenance capital we and the industry goes. It just extends whatever the perception of inventory life is, that just extends it out because we're just not playing through it at the same pace we were last year when we were running 20-plus rigs. So I hope that clarifies that a little bit. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Gail Nicholson from Stephens. Gail Nicholson : You guys are entering a phase of very attractive free cash generation on a myriad of oil prices, when you look at debt paydown, what is the appropriate amount of immediate debt paydown versus making sure you have cash on the balance sheet if the commodity price continues to be volatile? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Gail. I think, first and foremost, we need to have $191 million on our balance sheet to pay off our September 2021 note. And as Travis mentioned in his opening remarks, we plan to have that cash by early Q1 of next year. On top of that, we do have the fortune of having a former high-yield bond in our 2025 bond that's callable. So unlike the IG bonds that we have outstanding that are bullet maturities, we do have some flexibility in paying down that bond by calling it. I don't know when that's going to happen, but that's the logical next step.  And overall, I think while we're not big hoarders of cash, we should keep more of a cash balance than we have in the past given the volatility as well as the issues that come up with bullet maturities. You've got to have cash on the balance sheet to be able to handle those. And I think our plan is to make sure we have a little more cushion and rely less on bank financing overall. Gail Nicholson : And then looking at your free cash flow scenario on Page 7 of the presentation, you guys are using a 95% WTI realization there. I believe by the fourth quarter, 60% of your volumes should be getting Brent pricing. So I was just curious what Brent-WTI differential you're using for that 95% WTI realization? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. So we're using $3 there. That ratio is a little tighter right now. And because we're more exposed to Brent, the narrower Brent-WTI or Brent Midland spread has hurt us a little bit. I'm ignoring the fact that we do pay ourselves via our ownership in the pipeline to get to the Gulf Coast. But should that Brent-WTI spread widen, we'll naturally benefit. So I think on our Brent realized pricing, we're kind of realizing a Brent less $5 or $6. And for the rest, you're realizing an MEH price or a Midland direct price for now. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Neil Deman from Tourist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Travis, for you and Kaes, you were talking about the productivity and your confidence, I'm just wondering, is that -- would you all say the largest driver of this productivity? I mean, is it more driven by the asset location or just operational efficiencies? Or is it just kind of all of the above? And kind of what gives you that confidence? It sounds like you have now for the next few quarters. Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, I think it's all of the above, Neal. I mean, I don't think anyone's ever questioned Diamondback's cost structure, our ability to execute on the capital side. But overall, I do think the Street does look at these curves intently. And I think we're -- particularly on the Midland Basin side, focused on putting out some better curves over the next few quarters, if not years. And we've seen that drive positive rate of change stories on the Street, and we hope the Street picks that up as well. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just to follow-up, Travis, what you were saying on scale. Do -- you believe we continue to hear a lot of chatter. You have to have more scale. Is that more -- I don't know, I guess I've heard folks say that about having a more -- turning out more optimal pads, having more optimal areas in plays. Maybe you could comment around that? I mean, again, it seems like there's still a lot of chatter around that. I just wanted to hear maybe more of your color around how you view you all versus sort of the peers when it comes to -- again, maybe some others might have a bit more scale, but when it comes to optimal design and those sort of things? Travis Stice : Yes, Neal, listen, that commentary that's out there is just -- it's not based in fact. I mean at the end of the day, Diamondback is -- we're completing these wells as fast as anybody in the basin with 2 pads at the same time with these simul-frac operations. All of our supply chain is tight. We're not at any disadvantage based on size and scale.  And I think some of the commentary is because people are struggling with wider cost structures disconnected from Diamondback's cost structure. And so the commentary navigates towards size and scale because it's difficult to point to why down if I can do it so much cheaper and so much faster. I don't know, I mean, you need to ask the people that are making those comments why they're making those comments because it's certainly, from my shareholders' perspective -- our shareholders' perspective, that's not what we're seeing nor hearing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar from Wells Fargo. Nitin Kumar : I would like to revisit the whole concept of industry consolidation. A lot of your peers in their commentary, not only mentioned scale, but talked about just maybe a little bit of a tough environment to operate in. Your comments suggest a bit of optimism knowing that you don't have a crystal ball, just kind of maybe talk about your macro view from here and what you're seeing that gives you the confidence to go it alone? Travis Stice : Well, there's certainly some significant headwinds on the commodity space right now. I mean we've got the election uncertainty and looming policy changes, if there's an administration change. We've got COVID that's still -- we're still struggling to -- how to contain that. And is there going to be a vaccine anytime soon, and what does that mean to the supply demand recovery? We've got OPEC+ meeting in December to talk about whether they maintain cuts or start easing those cuts, and then we've got a global inventory overhang that's still there. All of those are macro issues that I can't control, and we can't influence. But what we can do is continue to focus on the cost structure and how we execute on our development plan, how we demonstrate confidence in our base dividend and how in improving commodity price world, we take advantage of an increasing our shareholder-friendly returns program. We've already addressed -- we're addressing our debt issue right now. So look, this 2020 -- let's be clear, this has been a global apocalyptic event, not only for citizens at large, but certainly for our industry. And we're at a point now where we feel very confident in the business plan that we have in place. We feel very confident in our ability to execute and consistently deliver on that business plan.  And we also feel like we're enough of an adult in the way that we look at things, if they get worse from here, we'll change our behaviors, and we'll slow down and preserve capital. So there's nothing for me not to confident be in. And there is uncertainty ahead of us in the commodity price world. But I'm confident in the people we have at Diamondback, and I'm confident in the communication we have with our shareholders about what it is we're trying to accomplish. Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. And Nitin, this business is not easy right now. There's no denying that, but that doesn't mean we're going to capitulate at the bottom of the cycle. I think Travis said it in his prepared remarks that we're not going to make a rash decision at the bottom of the cycle. And anything that happens, means you have to get better, not necessarily bigger, to ride out of storm. This is not an easy business. We have plenty of our production hedged on the downside in 2021 and as Travis said, if things get worse, we'll have to make the tough decisions like we have already in 2020. Travis Stice : Look, Nitin, just one other point. At the bottom of the cycle, which I don't know if we're completely at the bottom of the cycle now. But even as bad as things have been in 2020, Diamondback is still a profitable company. We generated $153 million worth of free cash flow in the third quarter. We're paying our base dividend, which is yielding above the S&P 500, and we're reducing debt at the bottom of this cycle. And so if we can accomplish all of those things at the bottom of the cycle, think about what the world is going to look like for our shareholders as we start coming out of the other side of the cycle, which we know is inevitable, and we know that oil price will increase in the future. We just don't know when. But if we're profitable like this at the very bottom of the cycle. And that -- we're on the other side. We're good. Nitin Kumar : I appreciate those comments. And certainly, it's a tough market, but you've done a great job. Maybe turning to that great job for a second here. Every quarter, you report slightly better D&C costs. I mean, you're down 30% from just a year ago. In 2021, you have about 110 to 140 DUCs to help those cap efficiencies. But at what point in '21, do you think you need to add costs? And more importantly, what do you think that might do to your D&C costs at that point? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I mean there's no real sign that there's upward pressure on D&C costs today. Certainly, Nitin, if we got to 2021, we're not going to guide to all-time low well costs, and we do have about a 50 DUC tailwind helping us out in 2021. That'll be a nice benefit to us. But I think, overall, what we focus on is how many of these cost savings are permanent versus temporary. And while a good amount of these cost savings have been temporary, we have learned a lot in terms of drilling design in the Delaware Basin as well as completion design in the Midland Basin with the simul-frac crews that we're going to keep those savings for the long term.  So while we're not counting on service prices increasing anytime soon, we recognize those guys are dealing with a very tough down cycle just as we are. And at some point, service costs will go up, but that would probably coincide with higher commodity prices. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Derek Whitfield from Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Kaes, perhaps staying with you on your cost comments. Could you comment on how much of the D&C improvement between '19 and current structural versus market? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I mean, I'd say in the Delaware Basin, probably 50% is structural and 50% market. And then on the Midland Basin side, I'd say probably 1/3 is structural and 2/3 is market. We've already been pretty low on the cost curve, if not the lowest in the Midland Basin going into this downturn, and we have made some improvements with simul-frac and some cementing technology that we're implementing. But the Delaware has been where we've made significant progress. I mean, we drilled a second bone spring well in under 10 days, 10,000-foot well in under 10 days in Pecos County. I think our first wells in that area were 30-plus consistently. So those are the savings that are going to accrue to our shareholders long term. And those are the things we focus on rather than the -- picking up the phone and reducing the service costs. Derrick Whitfield : Understood. And then shifting to your 2021 outlook, would it be fair to assume there could be a downward bias in your maintenance capital projections for 2021 as we walk this equation forward in time with the significant reductions in capital costs you've achieved to date and the macro backdrop that likely will not change for at least through the first half of next year? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. But I think, Derek, the conversation needs to be is maintenance capital the right scenario? I think if we stay in the mid-30s and we get closer to our corporate breakeven I think the discussion needs to turn to, are you generating positive NPV for your shareholders at those prices? So certainly, there's a lot of headwinds on the commodity side, and we're going to keep that 25% to 35% range out there, and we've kept it out there just due to the uncertainty rather than lowering it or changing it through this year. Travis Stice : Derrick, I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments Kaes made about those permanent cost savings, 50% of Delaware and 1/3 in the Midland Basin. You shouldn't lose sight of the point that those are structural cost improvements on -- and operated. It's already the lowest or the best-in-class in those execution measures. So it's not a casual exercise from our operations organization to continue when they're already leading to drive costs out, but I'm just really proud of what they've been able to accomplish. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Asit Sen from Bank of America. Asit Sen : Scope 1 emission reduction of over 50% year-over-year was pretty significant and impressive. Just wondering what your plans are on emissions going forward? Are -- the lower hanging fruits already been addressed. And how are you thinking about handling the policy change with the potential new administration and how you plan to navigate the regulatory framework that looks like it's changing? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : I'll let Travis handle regulatory after I talk -- clarify one thing. Flaring is down 50% -- or sorry, a little over 50% year-to-date. And flaring makes up about 50% or 60% of our Scope 1 emission. So I think overall, Scope 1, probably down 25% to 35% in 2020 versus 2019 is more of a realistic number. We have made progress in our sustainability report to put out targets. I think we'll probably next come out with long-term targets, 4 or 5 year targets on all of the metrics that matter to our environmental scorecard, which we implemented this year. But overall, that's just a concerted effort between us and our midstream operator to reduce flaring overall. And I think we'll have a little bit of a tailwind as well with lower activity levels versus years prior, which makes up a smaller portion of those Scope 1 emissions. Travis Stice : Yes. I think as a general statement, Asit, American energy producers, we've got an important role in meeting the challenge of global climate change. We believe that climate policy has got to facilitate meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but it's also, at the same time, got to balance economic, environmental and energy security needs. And we've got to promote innovation solutions to this climate challenge. As Kaes highlighted, this year, we adopted emissions targets. And as part of our executive compensation plan. And we also -- uniquely, all of our employees, 737 employees of Diamondback, they share in that same bonus plan. So those environmental measures are part of their cash bonus. So -- and I'd also tell you, while we've not finalized incentive comp for 2021, emissions targets are going to continue to be included in our comp plans, and we're likely to set multiyear emissions reduction targets. And listen, I hope all the industry -- I hope all of the energy producers can kind of take this as a challenge to step forth and take a stand on what it is that we're trying to accomplish.  We have an environmental and the social license to operate in the areas we live and work, and Diamondback's trying to -- we're trying to stand up and take a leadership position in that. And again, just back to that scale comment, we're doing this -- don't have to be big to do this. We're doing it. We're doing it at our current scale. So getting big to accomplish to accomplish environmental goals, again, we've proven that that's not the case. I think if you look at our flaring from this time a year ago, even year-to-date, we're down 50-some-odd percent. From this time a year ago, we're down almost 75%. So we've done what we needed to do, and we'll continue to lean into that until we've eliminated all routine flaring. And we expect that to be sooner rather than later as long as we can work collaboratively with our midstream providers. Asit Sen : Appreciate that, Travis. And Travis on the cycle, you talked about a tough down cycle that we are facing right now. And yet, you talked about an inevitable upcycle. What gives you the confidence in an upcycle? Just want to get your medium-term thoughts on the industry. Travis Stice : Sure. There's a couple of things. I mean, pick your energy expert forecaster. I mean the world is going to continue to need energy from liquid hydrocarbons for many, many years to come. And our population is continuing to grow. We understand that there's going to be the world that's striving for energy transition. But in the near term, supply and demand is going to rebalance. And when it does, that's going to lead to the inevitable rise in commodity price. I don't know when that's going to occur. But I think it's probably going to occur sooner rather than later. But we're positioned to -- like I said, weather this storm, as brutal as it's been. We'll continue to do what's the best thing for our shareholders. But I am constructive on commodity price long-term because of the supply demand fundamentals. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi Group. Scott Gruber : So you guys have completed a few simul-frac wells now. What level of savings are you realizing on the simul-fracs wells? And is there any incremental benefit still come from simul-frac in your D&C figures? Or is that fully incorporated as we sit now? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Scott, I mean, it's fully baked into our leading-edge Midland well cost, which we put D&C at $4.50 a foot. I mean I think we are push -- continuing to push the envelope on simul-frac. And I think even recently in the third quarter, we completed two pads, separate well pads at the same time with the simul-frac crew and those pads are about 1,000 feet apart. So that's -- pretty engineering feat from the team. Overall, certainly, it can get more efficient. We're completing about 3,300 lateral feet a day. Some days, we're getting up to upwards of 4,000 lateral feet a day. So as those crews get more efficient, we'll continue to push the envelope there. But I also think the ancillary benefit is how quickly you can get into an area with existing production, complete a large pad and get out of that particular area so that your watered out production -- is watered out for a shorter period of time. So that's an unseen efficiency, but something that has been a positive rate of change for us since implementing the simul-frac crews. And on the cost side, we estimate it's about $25 or $30 a foot of savings per well on the completion side. Scott Gruber : Got it. So obviously, a lot of operational savings. Do you see any benefit on well performance in aggregate from the two wells given the creation of two side-by-side fracture networks at the same time? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : It's certainly fair to assume that you're completing a larger tank at the same time and, therefore, not having as large of a parent-child effect. I mean, I can't put a number on it, but we do agree that more wells completed at the same time is better for the reservoir. And if you have the infrastructure and facilities in place, you're not spending large dollars there. Then it's a logical path forward. Travis Stice : I'll tell you, Scott, the other kind of knock-on effect of that is that the modeling that we have to do, which is -- has gotten more and more complex over the years is what we call the water out effect. But because we're completing these wells so much faster, almost twice as fast, that water out effect has really been positively impacted in terms of its length and duration and its overall impact because we're getting on and off these wells so much faster. Not something we really contemplated when we started simul-frac, but we've seen the benefits of that now. Operator : Our next question will come from the line Jeff Grampp from Northland Capital. Jeffrey Grampp : Curious on the dividend front, it seems like given the free cash flow that you guys are projecting next year, certainly fundable at low prices and seems safe. So how are you guys assessing the right time to maybe look at growing that? It seems like, Travis, as you pointed out, the yield on it is obviously very competitive. So perhaps that's something that needs to get kind of rectified organically before looking at dividend growth? Or just kind of you thoughts there would be great. Travis Stice : Yes, that's a good -- that was the reason I made that point earlier was the fact that our yield is already, what, at over 5%. So I'll just tell you that our Board is committed to that dividend is the primary form of our shareholder return program. And we talk about it at least every quarter, if not more frequently than that. But I've been -- I've tried to be very clear what our strategy is right now, it's to pay that base dividend at -- right now, it's above an S&P 500 yield and reduce debt. And as commodity price rises, well then we have options to do things with excess free cash flow above the dividend and debt reduction. Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. And Jeff, I think it's important to look back at earlier this year and the conviction it took to maintain that dividend through the down cycle or the worst of the down cycle. That was not an easy decision, particularly after we doubled the dividend in February. So I keep hearing about forward return of capital and what people are going to do. I think looking at our history and what we've leaned into in order to maintain that dividend, while others have either suspended theirs, cut it or even sold their companies should be reviewed by our shareholders. Jeffrey Grampp : Yes. That's a Good point, Kaes. Appreciate that. And my follow-up, looking at the -- Slide 5 here on the new deck, you guys are suggesting I think 34 to 64 completions in 4Q. I know that's just kind of implied based on the guide. So just wondering if you guys can give us an indication of where you expect 4Q completions to fall in that range? And maybe it's kind of a related point, in the maintenance world for '21, how many fewer wells do you guys think get completed in '21 versus '20? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I think overall, Q4 is probably at the midpoint, if not a bit above for completions now. It is dependent upon when those wells are turned to production. You do have 8 days of holidays at the end of the year. So there could be some noise in the amount of wells, but certainly, the midpoint-ish is a good guide. And then in 2021, I do think we are moving to more Midland Basin. So you do need more wells to keep production flat in the Midland Basin than you do in the Delaware. Those wells cost significantly less, but they produced less in that particular year. So I think a range around the upper half of what we put this year is likely, but we're still doing all the engineering and high grading the development plan to get those numbers out. Operator : . Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Just a couple of follow-ups that are more specific to some of the Q&A that already occurred. But you talked a few times about seeing some better well performance recently. Can you quantify some of that and tell us how you feel confident that, that's what you expect going forward? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Scott, I mean, listen, we look at production every day, and we look at individual well results every day. And what we're seeing is some really good pads that are coming on in the Midland Basin and outperforming our expectations as well as a few pads in the Delaware, particularly in the Vermejo area, that are also exceeding our expectations. So while I'm not going to give a number out, I think the message is increased confidence. And 2020 has been a tough year, where we were running 20 rigs in Q1 and completed a lot of wells in the Southern Delaware and then had to curtail a lot of wells in Q2. So I think we're starting to finally see the benefits of that reallocated capital plan in Q3 and Q4 and expect that to continue into 2021. Scott Hanold : Okay. Fair enough. And then going back, obviously, to the plan in 2020 and maybe beyond, but you talk about obviously prioritizing the dividend and debt pay down. Can you give us -- can you walk us through what oil price or what amount of free cash flow gets you guys to look at things like a shareholder return or like growth? Or how does that conversation happen? I know it feels like we're a long way from there, but certainly, it's a relevant kind of topic to think about like where is that point that it comes to do one or both of those? And how does that work? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Well, I think we need to clarify that it's an increased shareholder return, right? Because we already are returning capital to shareholders in the form of our base dividend, which has the highest yield in the space. So I think that gets lost in the shuffle of some of this analyst commentary today.  But I think, Scott, we got to see a demand recovery and some stability in the forward outlook. And right now, there's about as many things working against us as an industry as they ever have been. And once those get clarity, and let's say we're safely into the high $40s WTI with a strip that is comfortably in that range, then I think we can have that conversation. But I don't want to have that conversation at $37 going to $38 today. Scott Hanold : Yes. Is there a leverage level that you need to see first? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : No. Because leverage is a function of both EBITDA and gross debt. So I think as long as we're comfortable that we are reducing gross debt consistently, the additional return of capital is not mutually exclusive to our ability to reduce gross debt. I think the one thing that is off the table is significant growth. And those days are probably behind us. We've been as a bigger grower as anybody in this industry. But I think shareholders want cash, they want it now. And therefore, we're going to do that through our growing base dividend and also reducing the leverage issue to reduce our equity cost of capital and therefore, improve the stock price. Operator : And our next question comes from Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Scott kind of front ran my question a little bit there, but I will try to push it a little bit further by looking at your Slide 6 in your presentation, and I just want to see if I'm interpreting this the right way. When I look at that graph you guys have for your investment framework on the left-hand part of the slide, to me, the message I get is that you guys wouldn't add any growth-directed CapEx until we were over $55, but then it's on the table over $55 WTI. Is that the right interpretation? Or is there something else there? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Charles, I mean that would be a really good day versus where we've been over the last 9 months. So I'd be happy to have that conversation if we start to see a 5 handle on crude. But I think you've seen a lot of companies make a pledge that they're not going to grow over a certain amount. And I think it's hard to put this industry in a box, given how volatile it is. But I can say today that growth is off the table for us until we see significantly higher oil prices. And then that growth will be muted and somewhere in that single-digit range rather than the high double digits that we -- sorry, the low double digits or even teens that we've had in the past. Travis Stice : And I think the more germane question should be asked if those operators that are touting this future 2022 and beyond return to shareholders. I think the more important question should be, how does that look at a $36 world as opposed to what we're going to do when oil is $55 a barrel. Charles Meade : Right, Travis. I've appreciated the themes you've tried to amplify in your comments on that front. I think maybe -- this is -- I think this is kind of a big picture question more familiar territory. But when I talk to people who aren't involved in this space, one of the pushbacks we get is they say, well, these maintenance CapEx plans don't really seem to make sense. If it's not attractive to invest and grow your volumes, why do you want to invest to keep your volumes flat? And what are the other pieces of the picture that you'd put out there to try to answer that question about why it's important to keep production flat, if you can? Travis Stice : Yes. Just generally, I think you're raising the right question. The right question should be, what kind of returns are you generating on your capital program? If it's maintenance capital, what kind of returns do you generate in a $35, $36 a barrel. And if the answer is little to no returns to our investors, then why would you even keep volumes flat? That's what I tried to raise -- I tried to read that point in my prepared remarks. Look, the conversation should not be about growth, it should be that if we remain range bound around $35 a barrel, how much and how fast do you cut capital and volume decline. Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : And on top of that, what's been lost is, what is the rate of return of that program? I think Travis said that, and are you breaking even? Or are you actually returning cash? And I look forward to other companies answering that question in this commodity price environment. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : I wanted to follow-up on the topic of decline rates. It's come up a couple of times on the call, but I wanted to see, especially given that it was brought up as a reason for consolidation by another company. How you see your decline rates this year and in the maintenance capital plan next year on an oil and BOE basis, and your confidence in ability to execute a free cash capital returns model from the perspective of a Permian pure play? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Brian, it's a very good question. It's very topical, right? And I think companies have reasons for why they do things. I'm only going to speak about Diamondback. And I know that slowing down as much as we have is reducing our base decline. Our base decline is going to go down from high $30s oil to mid-30s oil in 2021. BOE is slightly below that. But a really smart investor told me, as long as you're running the treadmill at the right pace and generating free cash above that capital, this business model can work. And as long as we're setting that target and making sure that we're not moving activity levels up, down all around consistently and consistently generating free cash. I think people are going to pay attention to that and prove that you can return capital and generate sufficient returns to be successful in U.S. shale. Travis Stice : It's just really difficult to look at an acquisition or a merger and try to justify it on decline rate. And I get the math behind that. But I think Kaes articulated the way we think about decline rates, but it's unlikely with -- I'll stop there. Brian Singer : And then my follow-up is also a little bit on the M&A discussion, but more from a diamondback look back perspective, you've done M&A before, Energen. I think about 2 years ago, it closed or so, maybe a little bit less than that. And I wondered, as you look back and you highlighted a little bit some of the benefits from ESPs and some learnings. But how you look within the framework that you set for what makes good M&A to the buyer at the -- and how Energen or the other deals you've done impacted Diamondback today? And then what do you see as the pitfalls that you've learned that maybe you may or may not be applicable for others? Travis Stice : Brian, we spent a lot of time post-Energen acquisition to articulate what the synergies were and what our progress was on delivering . And we created the industry's first synergy scorecard so that our investors could hold us accountable on a quarterly basis on how we delivered on those things. And look, we delivered on every one of those things, including becoming investment grade a full year ahead of time, dollar amount. So from the things that we could control, all of these acquisitions have worked out well for us. Now the oil price assumptions that we made at the time of the acquisitions have those, have those played out? Well certainly not in 2020. Have the development plans been adjusted in some cases because of learnings? Yes, and that means accelerated and decelerated in some cases. But look, at the end of the day, we've got to deliver on what we can control. And I think we've been able to do that, and we're still demonstrating that today.  I think as we've done our look backs and we realized that commodity price moved away from us on some of those things, we have talked about our hedging strategy relative to acquisitions. Should we take a portion of commodity price risk off the table at acquisition time by doing hedges. But other than that, the operational measures, the cost-saving measures, the G&A and LOE reductions, those things have all -- we've delivered on all of those, and you can go back just a couple of quarters and look at our, what we call our synergy scorecard and our accountability towards -- to our shareholders for delivering on those.  And I think, listen, bottom line, Brian, if you can do it, we deliver on it. And if you can't, you come up with all these different kind of excuses. And so we hold ourselves accountable for what we promised to our shareholders, and we'll always do that on a go-forward basis as well. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the high grading comment. I think if I wind the clock back a little bit to 2019, you guys have basically said that we will be working in some lower IRR zones into our development plan to make sure those resources were properly captured over time and not left behind. Just wanted to get a sense of your kind of recent comments about high grading indicated that maybe you're moving away from doing some of that in the near term, just given the lower oil price environment that we're in here? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : So, I mean, I think you have to look at that at the margin. I certainly don't think we're a abandoning co-development at all. We do think developing more zones together at the same time, should those zones be economic at today, $40 a barrel, they're going to get developed. Spacing assumptions between zones can change and should widen as commodity prices weaken. But I think the high grading is really more about the consistency and deliverability of Midland Basin rock at low cost. And we were shifting to the Midland Basin before this downturn, but the downturn certainly accelerated it and moved us more to a 2/3, 1/3 or 70-30, Midland Basin, Delaware Basin, than a 55-45 or 60-40. Leo Mariani : And I guess just a follow-up on your maintenance CapEx range for next year. You guys are certainly -- seem confident you can execute this at a 25% to 35% lower budget. Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity on what gets you the 25% lower versus the 35% lower? Is it really just about well costs? And obviously, you guys articulated that leading edge well costs have come down quite a bit here recently? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I think it's well costs and the number of wells completed. We also are -- while we're not thinking about it today, you do need to plan for 2022 in 2021, particularly from a rig count perspective. So looking to keep that guidance live today and narrow it as we finalize our development plan over the next few months. Operator : Our next question will come from line Jeffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Jeffrey Lambujon : Just one from me on the corporate structure specific to Rattler. Just looking at relative valuation between Diamondback and Rattler? Just curious if there's an opportunity there or any consideration internally to potentially pull that structure in? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. Jeff, we're certainly looking at it. Rattler is a new company in its infancy. And I think this kind of ties to our commentary on M&A. We're not looking to do anything rash at the bottom of the cycle. Certainly, Rattler has gone through a large phase of growth through all of the equity method investments. Those are behind us. The business is generating free cash. It's not getting a lot of credit from the market. But I think we've studied GP LP relationships throughout E&P land very, very closely. And I think for us, we see our LPs as partners and therefore, aren't going to make a rash decision, even though the 2 multiples are trading on top of each other today. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of David Heikkinen from Heikkinen Energy. David Amoss : The question I had was, we're thinking about Permian being overpiped and just the gross volumes that you all are producing, clearly, will be 240,000 or somewhere would be our estimate versus your 175,000 commitment. But as a whole, can you just give us what your gross volumes are for the third quarter so we can start thinking through the whole industry as we get into '21? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, David, that's a good question. We're probably in the 220,000 to 230,000 gross range from a production perspective. So not having to take-or-pay commitments, which I think we set up those contracts in a way that half of our pipeline space is take-or-pay and the other half is from the acreage dedication. So trying to avoid cash outflows for take-or-pay commitments and marketing arrangements.  Certainly the Permian is over piped today. I think we see these commitments and our space on the pipelines as long-term insurance policies, and while Brent Midland has gone against us for the last couple of quarters, the volatility in this industry has been dramatic. And there is some phone calls that we could make in March and April to know that our barrels are going to move and exit the water or hit floating storage because of our commitments to those pipelines. So certainly over piped, but I think the legacy pipelines need to reduce their tariffs before ours that we're on, which are the lower tariff pipes in the basin get hit more. David Amoss : Thinking about sub dollar tariffs, is that reasonable for some of the new recontracting? until we... Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I think that could be fair. While I'm not -- while we're not involved in that process, certainly, the market will dictate and the market spreads will dictate what new tariffs look like. Operator : Last call will come from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Jeanine Wai : My first question is on the maintenance Capex. My second question is on spacing. For the maintenance Capex, in terms of just trying to understand all the moving pieces here, you've done a really great job at meaningfully reducing well costs year-over-year. And I think I heard you say earlier in the call that maintenance -- or sorry, that midstream on infrastructure CapEx would be down about 50% as well next year. So in terms of the workovers, I think before you mentioned that you reduced the number of workover rigs by as much as 80% at 1 point to respond to prices, and so can you just comment on how workover costs may trend next year at different oil prices? And how are these costs split between CapEx and operating expense? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes, Jeanine, I mean there's a very distinct difference between workover rigs that are used for Opex, which is our traditional ROE and then what we call capital workovers, which is basically converting your ESPs to their final form of lift, which is usually a rod pump. So we do spend a little bit of capital, $0.25 million or so per well that goes to its final form of lift, and that will be part of the 2021 budget. It's never been a big issue for us or a big piece of our budget because we've always completed more wells than 10 years prior and the capital budget continue to expand. But heading into 2021, if you think back 3 years ago, we completed about 300 wells pro forma, and those wells in 2021 are going to move to their final form of lift. Jeanine Wai : That's very helpful. And my second question is on spacing. In terms of the inventory and development strategy, is there any change to how you're thinking about interlateral or vertical spacing between zones and either the basins going forward? i think I heard you mentioned earlier that spacing should probably widen at lower oil prices, and then we noticed like a slight change in the slide. So we just wanted to check-in? Kaes Van\u00e2\u0080\u0099 t Hof : Yes. I mean, I think in the Midland Basin, where you have more economic zones that are getting co developed, we're getting smarter about both vertical and horizontal spacing and those spacing assumptions vary versus Howard County versus Northern Martin County versus Midland County. So continuing to refine our development program, I think secondary zones will be spaced wider than primary zones that are the highest rate of return. In the Delaware Basin, it's less of an issue because you have less zones that are economic or comparable that compete for capital today. But in the Delaware -- or in the Midland, we are refining spacing, and while it's not widening significantly, I'd say, secondary zones should get wider as oil prices go lower. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for any closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you. It's another milestone made today's election day. And I can't help but be reminded that one of the enduring legacies our founding fathers left us was a system for a peaceful transfer of power. And as pray for our country that we can remain calm in these upcoming days and weeks as we move through this process of electing our next leader. Thank you, everyone, for listening in today and for the good questions. If you've got any additional questions or follow-ups, just reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thank you, and stay well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Adam Lawlis. Sir, please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Lateef. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. During our call today, we'll reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. And welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. Diamondback continue to execute well in the fourth quarter of 2020, setting the company up for continued solid operational performance in 2021. The benefits of the company's strategy to move activity to our most productive areas in the second quarter of 2020 is now starting to pay dividends in terms of capital efficiency and early time well performance. Well costs and cash operating costs remain near all-time lows, and our average completed lateral length in the fourth quarter was over 13,000 lateral feet, a company record. These operational achievements will translate directly into increased returns to our stockholders as commodity prices have risen in recent months. We are still operating in a market supported by supply that's being purposefully withheld to allow global inventories to decline as demand recovers from the depths of the global pandemic. Diamondback continues to see no need to grow oil production into this artificially undersupplied market and instead, plans to hold fourth quarter 2020 production flat, while generating free cash flow used to pay our dividend and pay down debt. The Board's decision to increase our dividend by 7% exhibits its confidence in the forward development plan released today, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Our capital allocation philosophy remains unchanged, hold production flat in the most capital-efficient manner, with free cash flow used for our dividend and to pay down debt. Growing our dividend and paying down debt are not mutually exclusive, and the majority of our free cash flow will be used for debt pay down in 2021. The fourth quarter of 2020 built on the momentum started in the third quarter with free cash flow increasing to over $242 million, up 58% from the $153 million of free cash flow generated in the third quarter last year. We expect this trend to continue in 2021, where we currently expect to generate nearly $1 billion of free cash flow at $50 oil pro forma for the closing of our acquisition of Guidon this Friday. This free cash flow implies a reinvestment ratio below 60% at $50 oil and the mid-point of our $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion capital budget for this year. Note that our CapEx guidance includes the addition of approximately $100 million of capital for the Guidon acquisition, which encompasses one net operated rig added, as well as associated infrastructure and environmental spend. Our production guidance that ties to this capital budget for 2021 assumes that we hold Diamondback's expected fourth quarter oil production of 170 to 175,000 barrels of oil per day flat, plus 10-months of the 12,000 barrels of oil per day that Guidon was producing at time of acquisition announcement. This production guidance also accounts for the estimated impact of the severe winter storms in the Permian Basin last week, which we estimate to have knocked out the equivalent of 100% of our production for four to five days. Production has nearly returned to pre-storm levels as of today, and we expect to make up a majority of the lost production throughout the year, but will not be able to make it all up in the first quarter. The stockholder meeting to vote on our pending merger with QEP Resources is scheduled for March 16th. The merger is expected to close shortly thereafter, subject to QEP stockholder approval. Should the deal approve, we will update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable after closing. While this creates a noisy first quarter in terms of production additions, it will also create a clean look at the pro forma business in the second quarter and beyond. We have only one material term debt maturity due in the next four years, $191 million that remains outstanding on our 2021 maturity. We expect to have cash on hand to retire this note when it is callable at par later this year. After this maturity, we do not have any material outstanding obligations until 2024. We also have a legacy high-yield bond due 2025 that's currently callable, providing optionality for further gross debt reduction as free cash flow materializes. Turning to ESG. Diamondback today announced a major initiative relating to ESG performance and disclosure, including Scope 1 and methane emissions intensity reduction targets, as well as a commitment to point forward Scope 1 carbon neutrality or Net Zero Now. We are committing to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024, and we are committing to reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% from 2019 levels, also by 2024. A detailed breakdown of our Scope 1 and methane emissions from 2019 can be seen on pages 13 and 14 of our latest investor presentation. Diamondback expects to continue to reduce flaring, which is now down almost 90% from 2019 levels, directly impacting over 50% of our 2019 Scope 1 emissions. We also expect to spend approximately $15 million a year over the next four years to retrofit about 600 of our tank batteries with air-powered pneumatic control systems, replacing methane-emitting gas-operated pneumatic control systems. These two changes will be significant drivers in reducing our carbon footprint, but other initiatives like methane leak detection and full field electrification will also have a direct impact on our emissions reduction strategy. Diamondback today also announced the Net Zero Now initiative, which means that as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to be produced with zero net Scope 1 emissions. The GHG and methane intensity reduction targets mentioned earlier are the primary focus, as it relates to our environmental responsibility. But we recognize we will still have a carbon footprint. Therefore, carbon offset credits will be purchased to offset our remaining emissions. Eventually, we expect Diamondback or one of our subsidiaries to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset our remaining Scope 1 emissions, but the credits are a bridge to that time and place. With these major announcements, Diamondback has chosen to adopt a strategy to operate with the highest level of environmental responsibility. Our social and environmental license to operate as a public oil and gas company based in the United States is going to be influenced by our capital providers, and we do not expect our investor pressure for oil and gas companies to improve their environmental performance to subside anytime soon. It is incumbent on us to improve our environmental performance and compete for capital in an industry with ever increasing external pressures. Carbon emissions are a cost, and Diamondback is working to become the low-carbon operator, in addition to our leadership position, as the operator with the lowest capital and operating cost. I am very excited about Diamondback's current position and the strength of our forward outlook, as evidenced by our 7% dividend increase announced yesterday. We are forecasting significant consistent free cash flow generation, translating into returns to shareholders. We look forward to successfully closing and integrating the Guidon acquisition and the QEP merger, and we'll update the market on our pro forma plans as soon as practicable. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, Travis and team. Travis, I wanted to pick your brain a little a bit about the long-term kind of profile at Diamondback. On a pro forma basis, in our model, which includes QEP, we calculate about $1.4 billion of after dividend free cash flow over the next five years. And I think your dividend is about $300 million, so call it $1.4 million after the dividend or $7 billion. You guys talked about today paying off a little less than $200 million of debt due later this year, plus funding the $375 million of cash from the Guidon acquisition. And then also it sounds like leaning into the dividend on a go-forward basis is something you plan on. But I guess, our broader question is, what are your plans on a longer-term basis in terms of deploying this excess cash? Travis Stice : Well, certainly, Arun. That's a good problem to have, right? And I think our cost structure really magnifies our ability to generate that free cash flow. First, the operating metrics of the company continue to just look outstanding. So I'm really excited about that, and we've evidenced it now, for a couple of quarters. But at the board level, we consistently talk about leaning into the base dividend and continuing to enhance our shareholder as a form - as a way of enhancing our shareholder return program. And it's really, like I said, a problem of blessings to have that kind of free cash flow. We want to continue to work the debt quantum down, which we intend to do so. And we'll do like we've always done, and be creative in returning that money back to our shareholders. I've been very demonstrative in our stance of not trying to grow production. So any fears that we're going to take money and start drilling more wells with it this year is just off the table. So it's a good problem to have. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Arun, on the debt side, I think, in general, anything that has a maturity prior to 2029 is on the table for debt pay down. And I think, we're looking to set the business up to have kind of one turn of permanent leverage with a long-term maturity over 10 years at $50 oil. So in the front end of the curve, all that debt is eligible for paydown, but also not mutually exclusive from the base dividend continuing to increase here. Arun Jayaram : Got it, got it. Kaes, maybe my follow-up is for you. One of the questions we got last night was just looking at the Midland Basin, D, C&E got on a lot of foot basis I think you averaged about $520 a foot in the second half. The '21 guide is a little bit above that. So I just wanted to understand, what you're dialing in, in terms of perhaps some inflation. And does the mix - is there a mix effect with the Guidon assets being added there? I assume that this is excluding QEP? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. There's nothing on the mix side, Arun. I think we've said in the past, we're not going to guide to all-time low well costs. I think right now, we're in the $500 to $520 a foot range, and we're trying to hold on to that as long as we can. We know that the service industry has suffered through this downturn as much as anybody if not more. And there are some - some pricing pressures at the margin. I wouldn't say, it's on the big ticket items, but you are starting to see some pressure on casing prices and smaller field service items. So like we talked about, the mid-point of our guide is 8% to 10% above where well costs are today. I would hope, the good guys can keep some of that on our side and outperform as we go through the year. But just being conservative on today is February 23rd and we've got 10 more months left of hopefully, $55 plus oil, and that will result in some service cost pressures. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neil Dingmann : Kaes and Travis, my question is, I know - I'm trying to think how long - it hasn't been too terribly long ago that you all restructured, I know, your gathering and processing. You took, I think, at your expense on that. Could you talk a bit about now, the benefits of that from a - just not only from a pricing, but from - I know some folks earlier around the storm and all were having trouble how people take their gas. Could you just talk about both those aspects? And now sort of after converting those contracts from a percent of proceeds to a fixed fee, kind of what - if there's anything more that's needed to be done and the benefits there? Travis Stice : Yeah. Neal, I mean, we had a pretty high flaring number in 2019, and it was pretty frustrating to us that, that number was as high as it was. Unfortunately, it was that high because we had a gas processor who had a percent of proceeds contract that was losing money on that contract, and therefore, it wasn't very fair on how much they sent us to flare versus some of their other contracts. So, we took that price risk and decided to restructure that contract into a fixed fee deal. And you can see in the flaring numbers, our numbers have come down dramatically, mostly because of that particular contract moving to fixed fee. Now, with NGLs and gas rallying, that fixed fee stays the same, and we get the benefit as the operator. So that's helping a lot. I don't think it had a lot of impact on - from a storm perspective. I think our field organization during the storm actually stepped up to get power - or get natural gas flowing back to local power plants in the Permian, which eased the problem and stopped the rolling blackouts in the Permian almost immediately. So two separate items, but certainly proud of the field organization for what they did for the cities of Midland and Odessa. Neil Dingmann : Yeah. Nice changes there. And then, Travis, just my follow-up, just on the efficiencies you've seen, could you talk - maybe give us an idea, I think, let's call it, post-QEP. I know you've talked about maybe going to eight, nine rigs. I'm just trying to get an idea of both on the D&C side, how many - like kind of what you're up to now as wells per year? For a while, what was it, six to seven rigs, and you were talking about completing, I don't know, nearly 200 - up to 200? Could you give us idea of kind of where your optimal efficiencies are? And is there - I mean, it really is just at sort of what I call crazy levels versus where we were a couple of years ago. I'm just wondering can that get any better? Travis Stice : Yeah. I mean, I think, Neil, the rigs, the efficiencies continue to creep up, but we're going to run, I think, nine rigs essentially average for the year to drill 190 wells with 75% of that in the Midland Basin, all over 10,000 feet. But really, the efficiency that's improved is on the frac side. I mean, I think our completion cadence, we're expecting to complete 220 or 225 wells, all over 10,000 feet with three Simul-Frac crews and one spot crew. So, really, the efficiency on both sides is pretty dramatic. And you can see that also in the lateral length, right? I mean we completed over 13,000 average lateral feet in Q4. And we're looking for opportunities throughout our entire asset base to push lateral length to that 12,500 or 15,000 foot range. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Neil, I'll just add to that, that this time last year, just prior to this time, we were running over 20 drilling rigs. And today, we're running seven or eight, and when you go from that many rigs to that few of rigs, you have the opportunity to high grade your rigs. And then secondarily, when activity really troughed in the second quarter of last year, rather than just sitting on our hands and bemoaning the outlook, our organization really leaned in to try to improve efficiencies. It was a great opportunity with less field activity going on to really examine all of the processes, both on the drilling and completion side and on the production side as well. And so we took advantage of that trough in activity. And as the industry picked back up and as our activity picked back up, we were able to kind of make permanent some of those efficiencies that we revealed through the second quarter and early third quarter. So really proud of that, and I think we're going to see the direct benefits of that in 2021, and that's going to translate to more cash flow for our shareholders. Neil Dingmann : Thanks for the details, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson of Stephens. Your question please? Gail Nicholson : Good morning. The Net Zero Now strategy is great. Can you talk about the expectations on the cost of purchasing carbon offsets? And is that something that will be done at year end? And is that cost in the infrastructure and environmental CapEx line item? Kaes Van' t Hof : Gail, I'll start with the added CapEx. The big piece and the big goals here on the GHG sides are the emissions reductions, right? I think the Net Zero Now initiative is a great addition to the story, but it's not the primary focus. And the primary focus happens to be working down all the numbers you see on slide 13 and 14. And so the big dollars we're going to spend, we're going to spend about $15 million a year converting legacy gas pneumatic, tank batteries to air, and those batteries run off methane essentially and converting that to air, dramatically reduces your methane intensity automatically. So, I'd expect to see $15 million a year in the budget for that, and we've also built that in on the Guidon in QEP acreage as we get a hold of that and look to convert that. The carbon credits, we've already - are in process on a contract for some carbon credits. I won't give all the details, but I'll say it's a mid seven figure number, not an eight figure number. And the projects that we're investing in are tied directly to carbon capture or carbon sequestration rather than the tree planting side of the business. Travis Stice : Gail, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the purchasing of these carbon credits are really just a bridge until we get our operations enhanced and maybe look at some other future investments down the road. But we're really trying to invest in the future. And you know how tight Diamondback runs our CapEx. And spending money on tax credits actually provides us a great incentive to not use those by doing the right things out in the field, like Kaes was mentioning, and articulating to effectuate these changes. And it's a nice bridge in the interim, but that's not the focus of what this initiative is about. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then there is been some discussion lately regarding the benefits of hedges. Can you talk about the hedging strategy on a go-forward basis? And Kaes, specifically, in your view, how important is hedging to be able to deliver a consistent free cash generation profile? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I think it's really important, Gail. And I think in the depth of April and May of last year, I told Travis that do not get mad at me if we lost money on some hedges in 2021. And now we're at that point and the commodities rallied, and I think we're sleeping a lot better at night, knowing that the commodities rallied. So I think, overall, if you look at our hedge book, we've tried to keep very wide two-way collars. We're at the bottom end of our collars we're protecting our dividend and protecting - paying down some near-term maturities, but also trying not to limit all the upside to our shareholders. So I think you'll see us keep building that hedge book with wide collars. I think the percent hedge that we have is inverted just like the forward curve, and I think we're going to be patient adding hedges. But overall, I still think hedging is an important philosophy for an oil and gas company to guarantee returns and guarantee returns to shareholders in the form of true cash distributions. Travis Stice : Gail, I just want to return to your question that you asked earlier and reemphasize the point that we feel like we have a social and environmental license to operate. And I'll tell you, for the last multiple quarters, we've been really digging into this. But one of the things that surprised me was relatively, it's still a lot of money, but relatively how little cost is required to do the right thing here with regards particularly to methane emission and converting these tank batteries. And I think as other companies' kind of dig into that, I hope they find the same outcome that it is real dollars and it is real shareholder funds that we're diverting away from the drill bit, but it's not as bad as maybe what we were originally thinking. And again, I just go back to our environmental and social license and trying to do the right thing here. Gail Nicholson : No, I agree. It's basically a two to three well diversion every year to get this pneumatic gas on your batteries installed, which makes a huge difference. So I congratulate you guys are making that effort and more companies should do that. Travis Stice : Thank you, Gail. And yeah, it does sting a little bit, but I think it's the right thing to do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Your line is open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, Travis, Kaes and everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis Stice : Good morning, David. David Deckelbaum : Good morning. Just wanted to ask around lateral lengths, as you integrate Gideon and hopefully QEP here, you saw a tick-up on this larger pad in the fourth quarter where you were averaging 13,000 feet per well. You budgeted next year at 10,000, I guess, for FANG and Guidon. Should we expect that number to tick up in '21 and '22? I would imagine as you're integrating two assets, the availability of swaps kind of opens itself up there? Can you talk about where that lateral length progression is moving? And is this something that we should be thinking about the over for - on that 10,000 per well over the next couple of years? Travis Stice : Yeah. David, good question. I mean, I think the beauty of the Guidon and QEP assets as they sit relative to our position is that you have - they all fit hand and glove. And so that gives us an opportunity to push lateral lengths for one of our - what will be our biggest operating area for the next few years. So I'd put 10,000 as the floor. We still have rigs running outside of that main block. But if we're having - and we're going to have half of our rigs running in the big block in Martin County, I'd expect those five rigs probably average a little higher than 10,000, whereas the rest of the position might be a little below it. So could we get it up to - up 10%? I think that's possible. But again, the teams are doing their work. And the contiguous nature of that block is going to promote a lot of capital efficiency. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that. And my second question is just, you talked, Travis, about the macro environment and kind of eschewing [ph] growth in favor of returning on - capital to shareholders over time. It seems like with this fixed dividend increase, you guys are signaling that this is sort of a sustainable level at a $40 price and below, maybe mid 30s to 40. Considering now that we're in almost a $55 to $60 environment, does anything change operationally? You guys responded to a low price environment by coring up your activity. I know that you're not interested in growth at this point. But do you change the design at all at the field level and perhaps not core as much as you have been? Travis Stice : No, David, it's - we can't pay attention to weekly changes in commodity price. We have to try to do the best thing, the right thing from a reservoir performance all the time. And we're not getting enamored or stars in our eyes with higher commodity price. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. No one ever blamed you for drilling wells that are too good, David. David Deckelbaum : That's true. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Hanold of RBC. Your question, please. Scott Hanold : Yeah. Thanks. And maybe another follow-up on that, the last line of questioning. Obviously, it's - commend you guys for sticking to the plan, with maintenance this year. But there's a lot of potential for an oil super-cycle and if that does occur, like, how do you see Diamondback in a - like a 2022 plus outlook. And is there going to be a limit to the amount of growth you could push. I would assume that there's going to be some moderate growth that you'd see acceptable, given the amount of free cash flow that's out there. If you could just give us some color on. Is it a reinvestment rate you'd target? Is it a growth rate or free cash flow yield? How do you look at a much stronger for longer oil price cycle? Kaes Van' t Hof : Well, Scott, that will be a good problem to have. So, hopefully, we're on our way, but I think we've been pretty clear that we don't want to put a very complicated business into a box, in terms of reinvestment rate, growth rate. I mean, I think what we can say is that, if there was ever growth, called ponge [ph] by US shale, it would not be double digits, it wouldn't be zero. But, yeah, there is oil price where your free cash flow increases more if you grow slightly. And we've done that work. I still think we're a ways away from it, but we've proven that we can grow in the past and I think, a low cost structure benefits you when prices are weak, but it also is a kick-starter to potential growth if prices are strong. So I don't think it's time to talk about growth, but if there was growth ever mentioned for us its sub double digits or mid-single digits. Travis Stice : Yeah, just, just to re-emphasize the point I made earlier about, we're still in an undersupplied world and, yeah, we can see the tea leaves talking about a supercycle, but that's not where we are today. I think just that - just in the final analysis Scott, growth down and back, we'll have to see a fundamental shift in the macro supply, demand. But future growth is not something we're scared of. Now, as Kaes pointed out, hyper-growth is probably still not a role, but, growth when it drives incremental shareholder returns, it is part of our long-term decision matrix. But, right now, we simply don't need to grow, right, with this much excess storage and steel production capacity out there in the world. But I think trying to put ourselves into a decision, straight-jacket is anticipating an old supercycle is not is not good business for us right now. Scott Hanold : I appreciate that response. My follow-up is a little bit on current production rates. And if you can help me out a couple things, I guess, first off, you talked about, holding the line on the Diamondback legacy assets are on 172 to 175. Obviously and you kind of said that, fourth quarter levels, obviously you guys outperform that. You'll perform that in January as well. Just giving a little bit of color on, what do you mean by holding 171, 175 slab when you're, prone to the purposes above that rate? And then, if you can give also, some color on, what we should expect with QEP when it starts with you guys? And understanding that the last sort of like data point update was back in the third quarter of 2020? Travis Stice : Yeah, Scott. I'm going let Kaes to answer that, but I just, you provided me an opportunity to talk about how pleased we are with our operation performance, operational performance. We saw it in the fourth quarter. We saw it in January. And had not been historic 100-year storm out in the Permian. February we'd be looking good as well. So, really, really pleased at the way that we're executing right now in our operation performance. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Scott. We're looking to key production guidance and CapEx guidance is very simple. I mean, I think, we said we're going to work our way up to 170 to 175, oil by Q4. Luckily, we outperformed that. But that was going to be the baseline for our plan in 2021 all along. And if we outperform that plan then that's, some for the good guys. So, overall, nothing has changed in terms of our anticipation of keeping guide on plus QEP, plus Diamondback flat through 2021. And in this guidance, we put out, we're basically giving you FANG at 170 to 175, plus 10 months of Guidon out of 12,000 barrels a day. And a little storm impact which we expect to make up throughout the year. Scott Hanold : Okay. And what should we expect with QEP obviously the last update was I think at the third quarter average. What is the expected - like you have a sense of what that looks like when it starts up in March, with you guys? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, yeah, I can't, give you that today. I mean QEP is going to report there tomorrow and we'll see what that report says. And we will surely update the market as quickly as we can. But I can't give guidance on a deal that shareholders need to vote on. Scott Hanold : Understood. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your question please? Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Travis Stice : Hey, Scott. Scott Gruber : Saw the dividend increase here. One of your peers is dimensioning their comfort level with the base dividend as about 10% of operating cash flow at their normal crude price. Can you provide some color on how you think about, the appropriateness of the base dividend for Diamondback? Kaes Van' t Hof : I mean, I think that will be a good goal to work to. I mean, ours is a little lower than that in a $50 world and certainly lower than that at strip today. I kind of see it as more what's our consistent dividend growth rate over a longer period of time. And what are we doing to decrease the size of the enterprise value with free cash flow. I think right now, this dividend increase came a little early, but we also leaned into the dividend in 2020 during some pretty dark times. So I think investors have universally asked us to hold the dividend and continue to grow it consistently. And while 7% is our lowest growth rate of the past couple of years, I don't think it's off the table that we can revisit this - the dividend multiple times a year now at this point where we are. Scott Gruber : Got you. And then, just thinking about the budget split across the Midland and Delaware, 75% to the Midland this year. Can you just speak to the medium-term split, thinking over the next kind of two to four years, are you going to stay in that ballpark of around 75% to the Midland, post the acquisitions? And how should we think about, if we are back in an environment where you're starting to grow some, call it, mid single digit, how does that split start to shift, if at all? And does the Delaware provide more of the flex in the budget? Travis Stice : I kind of see it more as we're going to have a really large block in Martin County that we can put a lot of rigs to work pretty consistently, so long as we have the infrastructure in place, and we expect to do so. So I think with QEP, pending that deal closing, that 75% Midland number is going to go up, and hopefully, it stays kind of in that 75% to 85% of lateral footage consistently for the next three to five years. I think that's a little lower percentage of total capital, but it's going to be a pretty high percent of our net lateral footage for a long time here. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead. Derrick Whitfield : Hey. Good morning, all. And as many have said before me, thanks for taking a leadership position for the sector with your ESG initiatives. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : With regard to your potential investment in CCS to offset your Scope 1 emissions, would you likely do that in concert with EOR? And if so, have your teams evaluated the application of EOR in any of your interventional project areas? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Derrick, I mean, that's one of the pillars that we're looking at. I can't commit to anything today. But I think what we've tried to say is that the credits that we purchased here give us a little bit of time to study the market or even partner on projects at either Diamondback or Rattler to build out a more direct offset to our Scope 1 emissions. So that's in the fold. The hot topic of wind and solar, power in Texas is also in the fold. And I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities with companies with large balance sheets that are leading this energy transition that are also oil and gas companies. So I think we're going to play a small part in it and hopefully, find a good partner to develop carbon capture or one of these other renewable sources to offset our Scope 1. Travis Stice : But Derrick, I'll also add that while we don't - there's not specific EOR projects underway with 85% or 90% of the oil still left in the ground, even with the most advanced completions technologies, we know that enhanced oil recovery is a part of our industry's future. And there are some guys out there kind of on the leading edge that Diamondback, as our style, we're following very closely to see if they're having success. But it would be nice if those two things were - had the same mutual objectives, carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery and tight horizontally developed shale resources. But as Kaes pointed out, we're just barely getting started on that. Derrick Whitfield : That makes sense. And with my follow-up, shifting over to the capital side of your outlook, could you offer any color on a clean maintenance capital estimate, assuming the inclusion of QEP and based on your current cost expectations? Travis Stice : I mean it's kind of what we gave. I mean QEP has put out some high-level numbers on their full year 2021. So I think it's fair to look at those numbers. Now, if you think about us closing the deal in March, we'll only have cash CapEx for three quarters of that. But at current cost estimates, like I said, I think the mid-point of our guidance is 8% to 10% above where current well costs are. So, if we stay the same, you could chop 8% to 10% off of that and get a solid maintenance number. Derrick Whitfield : That's great. Thanks for your time guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Derrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is just on the M&A and A&D landscape. I know it may be a little too soon to talk about what opportunities both transactions could bring since the QEP deal is more expected to close next month. But are there any comments or thoughts you can share on how the landscape looks to you all in areas where you may be active once everything is rolled in? And then any comments on industry consolidation more broadly from here, especially following an active 2020 would be great as well. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I'll let Travis talk about the macro. But just in general in A&D, we've been following it pretty closely. I think there's a lot of capital that's been allocated towards PDP type transactions, which bodes well for any potential deal we look to pursue in the Williston - for QEP's Williston assets. It seems like that's the hot A&D market of the year so far. So we're excited about that. Commodity price certainly helps. We have some small stuff that we would look to sell in the Permian that's fully developed that doesn't compete for capital and that market looks pretty good. So we're excited about A&D. I think from a consolidation perspective, a lot of big consolidation happened in 2020, obviously, and you can just see now how much production is in the hands of 10 to 12 companies in the US, and I think that bodes well for capital discipline and industry consolidation, although I think it still needs to continue. Travis? Travis Stice : Yeah. What we've seen in the past, Jeff, when we go through one of these cycles of rapid commodity price increases, names that you would have thought would have come off the board - public names that would have come off the board, probably now have a lot greater runway with the higher commodity price. So usually, when you see these kinds of cycles accelerate, it makes, from a macro perspective, A&D harder to do. But just like Kaes was saying, though, we've got Guidon and soon to be QEP to roll in the mix and we're very comfortable with where our inventory sits right now in terms of runway in front of us. So I just want to add that in as well. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Appreciate it. And then my second one was just on hydrocarbon mix as the newly acquired assets are rolled in. Just wanted to get a sense for how you'd expect the higher weighting for Midland activity, which I guess should increase further once QEP is more fully rolled into effect oil and gas mix over the near term? Travis Stice : Yeah. It should help a little bit, 100 to 200 bps of oil mix. I think that's why we started guiding to oil separately from BOEs. The BOEs continue to outperform, primarily because flaring is down 5%, which has resulted in a lot higher BOE numbers and BOE reserves. So Midland certainly is oilier and moving to Midland, Northern Midland is going to help. But the production base is pretty large right now, so I think it's in the range of 100 to 200 bps, not more than that. Jeoffrey Lambujon : All right. Appreciate it. Travis Stice : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Travis, you've been very forceful on the capital discipline side, not using incremental cash flow back to the drill bit, focusing on paying debt and incremental return of capital to shareholders. You do have exposure and - through your partnerships to what others are doing. And I wondered, given some of the rig increases we've seen from private producers, if you have any perspective on what you see others doing and if you expect other operators in the Midland and Delaware basins to reflect the discipline that you're expressing here? Travis Stice : Yeah. Brian, I think - I know you're asking those questions to those individual operators. But from a macro perspective, what I'm seeing is that we still are undersupplied on rigs to keep the Permian Basin flat. So you may see some rig adds coming, but right now, it's probably not enough to offset the production declines that we've seen through the lack of investment over the last 12 months. So I believe, and maybe I'm the internal optimist, but I believe if moving through the depths of a global apocalypse that was created by this pandemic, if oil and gas companies haven't got discipline now, they probably never will. So I'm optimistic that the industry is going to tow the line on capital discipline, irrespective of commodity prices. Now there will be some time in the future, a signal when supply has worked off and Iranian barrels are absorbed and surplus OPEC capacities has consumed that the world will be signaling for growth. But as we tried to articulate earlier, the days of hyper growth in the shale industry should be part of our history, not part of our future. But I'll tell you, just adding to that, and I know you guys get tired of hearing me talk about our operations and our low cost. But as the low-cost producer, almost irrespective of commodity price, we're going to drive the highest returns to our shareholders. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. And then I wanted to further follow-up on the carbon net zero objective, and particularly on the sequestration and clean energy comments that you made. When you think about expanding the Diamondback footprint into sequestration or clean energy, do you see these as core competencies the Diamondback team already has, core competencies the team can easily bring in-house? Or should invest along with others to fund existing companies that have that core competency? Travis Stice : Yeah. No, Brian, I don't see those core competencies inside Diamondback, and it's unlikely that we would branch out into trying to say that we can become a better solar company or a better wind farm company than pre-existing. I think that's actually a trap that some companies get into as they try to diversify into areas where they're not experts. We at Diamondback know what the main thing is and the main thing is, is for us to produce barrels at the highest cash margin with the lowest cost and now the lowest carbon footprint. So I think the most likely scenario would be that we participate alongside a subject matter expert in whatever that carbon capture technology is. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis of Capital One Securities. Your question please? Richard Tullis : Thanks. Good morning. Travis and Kaes, so just continuing with the net zero initiative discussion. So just listening to everything this morning, so is it fair to say you may be initially more interested in the carbon capture side of CCUS rather than the CO2 transportation and sequestration side? Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Richard, it's just too early, right? I think we're getting away from the fact that the goal is get Scope 1 down by 50% as soon as possible and get methane down by 70% as soon as possible on the intensity side. And those remain the focus, right? I think getting into other businesses is a three, five, seven-year discussion. But the discussion today is, what are we going to do to get our carbon footprint down and not just offset it, right? I think eventually, offsetting it with something smart in terms of an investment, a small investment, but it's not going to end up taking 10%, 15%, 20% of our budget. I think, like Travis said, the main thing is the main thing, and that's we're an oil and gas producer that's going to be producing here for a long time. But as a public operator today, the 1pressures to operate in an environmentally responsible manner are only going one way, and we're taking the bull by the horns by getting those intensity numbers down as soon as possible. Travis Stice : Yeah. Richard, we're not trying to buy our way into carbon neutrality. We're trying to be very specific. You can see on slides 12, 13 and 14 in our investor deck how much transparency we're using to try to describe exactly what we're going to do. We've been very prescriptive in talking about 600 tank batteries that need to be retrofitted and spending $10 million to $15 million a year over the next three to four years in order to make that happen. So our focus is not to try to buy our way into carbon neutrality. Our focus is how can we invest to eliminate our Scope 1 emissions. And the carbon credits now provide us a bridge, and quite honestly, provides us an incentive because I don't like spending that money, but it provides us an incentive to get the operations in the shape that they need to be. And that's what we need for our shareholders, and that's what our industry needs as well, too. And I hope other companies can take a similar examination of what efforts they're doing to reduce methane emissions, particularly. Richard Tullis : Appreciate that. Good discussion. That's actually all I have. I appreciate it. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks, Richard. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Richard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. I have to apologize first. I may have joined a little bit late, you may have discussed it already. You raised the regular dividend, and you also mentioned that in the future, once your debt has come down further or that the position is better, you will look for other alternatives ways that to increase the shareholder distribution. So I wanted to see them, what is the precondition for that? Or what kind of debt level or that any kind of criteria you could indicate? And also, can you discuss your preference between the variable dividend and the buyback? Or that the regular dividend increase will be the primary source of the distribution? Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. I think a variable or buyback are things that are worth discussing when debt levels are at a level that we're very comfortable with, which is probably close to one times leverage at $45 to $50 WTI. So I think once we're closer to that range, we can talk about additional return to capital, which is kind of why, earlier in the call, I mentioned that anything with a maturity prior to 2029 in our debt stack is probably up for grabs to pay down in conjunction with continuing to increase the dividend. But, as soon as we get there, I think it's a worthy topic to say what is the best return to shareholders post or after the base dividend and when debt is very comfortably in that one times range. But first and foremost, we need to get our debt back down to $5.5 billion gross debt pro forma for all the deals that we've just done, and we'll be getting there as quickly as we can and continue to work that down. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made earlier. Kaes, I think it was you said in terms of purchasing the carbon offsetting credits, it's going to be some type of mid seven figure number. Just wanted to clarify, is that an annual number, roughly speaking, for you folks? And it sounded like you also talked about this transition time line kind of being three to seven years. So, should we expect that kind of for the next three to seven years? And is that something that would just kind of run through as an operating expense in your financials eventually? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Well, it's highly dependent upon how many tons of CO2 equivalent we emit, right? I mean in 2019, we emitted 1.4 million tons. I think we'll be well below that in 2020 and on to 2021. So the cost goes down. Now, if I was a betting man, I'd bet that carbon offset credits are going to continue to increase in price. We've secured a few years' worth right now. But I think it will be dependent upon how that market evolves over the coming years. But again, it's not a material expense, and it's not the priority. The priority is getting the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions that we have down so that you pay less of a penalty. Leo Mariani : Okay. Great. And obviously, you guys are clearly in the midst of closing the QEP and Guidon deals in the near term here. Travis, you briefly addressed M&A earlier. But as you get to your target debt number here in the near future, do you still have a desire at Diamondback to continue to be a consolidator of choice in the Permian? Travis Stice : Yeah. Look, Leo, we're very comfortable with where we are right now, particularly with these two deals closing, one Friday and then one in a couple of weeks after that. So, we're very comfortable where we are. And we'll just - like we always do, we monitor the landscapes, and if we think we can deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders, then we'll take a look at it. But in terms of inventory life and all of that, we're very comfortable with where we are. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your question please? Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis and Kaes. And to the rest of the team there. Travis Stice : Hey, Charles. Charles Meade : Kaes, so I think maybe this question might be for you, I appreciate you gave us a really pretty thorough rundown of your debt pay down options and you gave us a good framework. I'm wondering if you could refresh us a bit with your thinking or your options on the QEP debt, in particular, the '22 s and '23s, and how that might play into your - your debt paydown plans? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. It's certainly a chess piece, Charles. I think QEP has three notes outstanding, '22s, '23s and '26s. Those notes probably end up getting tendered for and refinance in some form or fashion, lower interest rate with longer average maturity, but also putting something on the front end of our debt stack to guarantee further debt pay down. So it's really dependent upon how many people tender the bonds, if and when that begins. I think the FANG 2025 notes is also a chess piece that goes into that. And I think we're pretty close to starting that process with the shareholder vote coming up in March 16. So we wanted to take advantage of these rates with three goals. We want to pay down gross debt overall over time at our discretion, we want to lower average interest rate, and we want a longer average term to maturity. And I think we're setting ourselves up to accomplish that. Charles Meade : Got it, Kaes. So if I understand you correctly, it's not committing to one path or another, but really just kind of continuing to pushing optimization and finding - picking your spot? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. With the caveat that, we do need to work on some restricted covenants and some reporting requirements on the QEP notes because we don't anticipate reporting as two separate companies for a long time. So I think Pioneer, Conoco, Chevron have all followed different or similar paths in handling the notes of the company they acquired, and we're going to copy one of those. Charles Meade : Got it. That makes sense. Thanks a lot for that. And then, Travis, this is perhaps for you. I wondered if you could characterize, the assets that you're picking up in Southeast Martin County or towards the - in the Southeast quadrant, that's - could you characterize how prominently do those factor into your 2021 plans? And to the extent you are going to put some rigs there, when would we expect to see some results from those assets? Travis Stice : Yeah. I mean, we're going to add one rig net for the Guidon deal, and that rig is going to drill a 10or 12 well pad here throughout the year. And that pad is going to come on early next year. And then, I think, I can't speak to the QEP development plan. But I think as soon as we can move rigs to that big block in Southeast Martin County, we're going to move two or three rigs there and be active there for the next five, even, eight years. Charles Meade : All right. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Your question please? Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis Stice : Hey, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : You're probably going to kill me. My questions are on the ESG and Net Zero Now initiative, but maybe just two quick ones. We know you've made it clear that you're not looking to buy your way out of emissions or anything like that. And the credits are really just a supplement to your good internal efforts. You mentioned you have some contracts in place at CCS. But in terms of the other options, what are the different markets that you're looking at in order to potentially buy offsets? I mean, we're thinking it's not California. We know Texas has an exchange market. And are you currently eligible to participate in all of the credit markets? Travis Stice : Yeah, we are Jeanine. And we're pretty focused on US carbon credits versus international. International, you can get a little cheaper, but I don't think that ties directly to our license to operate in the US. So the couple of projects that we've invested in, two of them are based in Texas, one of them is based in Wyoming, and that's our start. I think we're going to build a good relationship with our partners on this and eventually work to invest directly. But I think overall, with us executing on this initiative, there's going to be a lot of inbound phone calls on opportunities. And I just think our goal is to make sure what we do invest in ties more directly to what we produce rather than other environmental aspects. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Very interesting. And then, maybe just following up on Brian's question earlier. I know you're not looking to be a merchant power player or anything like that. But you're looking at both in-house and third-party opportunities; it sounds like, for the income-generating projects. So not to get ahead of ourselves, but we are. Longer term, could this be maybe carved out as a separate business, if you develop a portfolio? Because it seems like for a lot of these ESG projects, companies' kind of really only get credit or a lot of interest when it turns into like a real business that investors can quantify. And longer term, there's been lots of spin-offs and opportunities for that. So is that something that maybe you would consider? Kaes Van' t Hof : I mean, I think, we're getting way ahead of ourselves, Jeanine, on that. But I think we've proven to be pretty smart when it comes to spin-offs, but I think my head might explode if we thought about another spin-off right now. So we're going to just, first, get our numbers down. Second, invest smartly or wisely with bigger partners, and then third, figure out how to monetize down the line. But certainly, we're very cognizant of the multiples that, that side of the business gets versus an oil and gas company right now, but that's not the reason why we're doing this. Travis Stice : Yeah. Janine, we want to make sure we emphasize - keeping the main thing, I said that earlier. And we know what we're really good at, and we know what we're still learning at. And we're going to focus on what we're really good at, and we'll participate alongside someone that's really good at something else. And as Kaes said, for another fourth company or fourth entity, that's not - that doesn't sound very good to me right now. So I think our focus is going to be doing the right thing at Diamondback operations to drive down our emissions intensity. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. Travis Stice : Thanks, Jeanine. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to CEO, Travis Stice, for closing remarks. Sir? Travis Stice : Thank you. Occasionally, I'll use my closing remarks to add a message that's kind of directed towards our organization and a message I think sometimes important for our investors to hear that separates from sort of the standard quarter. This past week, as we're all acutely aware of, the Permian Basin experienced unprecedented weather event. We had over 220 hours of below freezing weather. And really across the Permian Basin, we had extended periods of no electricity and water supplies frozen and really, against all of that, we had a frozen and a dark oilfield. And our field organization, and in some cases, these individuals working over 20 hours a day, they were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants. They weren't working to get Diamondback's volumes flowing and back online earlier because of our quarterly objectives. They were working to get gas delivered to power generation plants that were - honestly, that were sitting idle, particularly on the West side of Odessa. And they were sitting idle because they didn't have any fuel. And through our efforts and other operators' efforts, gas was delivered and Texas had power. This occurred Wednesday evening, early Thursday morning. And by Thursday, most of Texas, again, had power. And it's - I just want to - the efforts that were displayed by many individuals in the Permian Basin transcends normal procedures for returning production in the Permian Basin is grateful for - we're really grateful for everything that you guys did. You answered the call and you put forth a heroic effort that will not be forgotten. Just want to tell you publicly, thank you for everything that you guys did. So with that, thanks for everyone participating in today's call. And if you've got any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided. Thanks, Lateef. Operator : Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. Diamondback had a successful first quarter, continuing to build off the momentum generated in the back half of 2020. Operationally, we are hitting on all cylinders. We were able to effectively navigate a once-in-a-generation winter storm while keeping well costs and cash operating costs near all-time lows. We closed both the Guidon and QEP acquisitions in the first quarter and are very pleased with how the integration efforts are progressing. We are achieving our synergy targets ahead of schedule and in excess of the $60 million to $80 million of annual cost savings we highlighted when the deals were announced. Yesterday, we also announced 3 noncore asset divestitures for gross expected proceeds of $832 million. By selling these noncore acreage positions in such a timely and opportunistic manner, we were able to take advantage of a strong A&D market and generate attractive cash returns for Diamondback shareholders. We anticipate using the combined proceeds from these noncore asset sales to accelerate debt reduction. As we discussed last quarter, even though oil demand has shown signs of recovery from the depths of the global pandemic, oil supply is still purposely being withheld from the market, primarily through the actions of OPEC+. As a result, we continue to believe we do not need production growth and will hold our pro forma fourth quarter 2020 oil production flat through 2021. Due to the complexity resulting from the timing of the QEP and Guidon acquisitions as well as the announced divestitures, we have instituted quarterly production and capital guidance for the first time. For the second quarter, we anticipate spending $350 million to $400 million in capital and producing 232,000 to 236,000 barrels of oil a day. This production range accounts for a full quarter of contribution from QEP's Williston asset and approximately 2 months of production from the announced noncore Permian asset sales. Looking at the full year of 2021, our free cash flow profile continues to improve. In the first quarter, we generated approximately $330 million of free cash flow, marking the third consecutive quarter of significant free cash generation. At current strip pricing and accounting for the Williston divestiture, we expect to generate approximately $1.4 billion in pre-dividend free cash flow this year at a reinvestment ratio of below 55%.  In March, we executed a successful tender offer and refinancing of all of QEP bonds and one of Diamondback's existing bonds. This refinancing equates to $40 million of annual interest expense savings and extended our average debt maturity by 3 years. Today, we have 3 debt maturities that are callable before the end of this year : $191 million due later this year, $650 million due in 2023 and $432 million due in 2025. We expect to use cash on hand from internally generated cash flow as well as proceeds from our asset sales to retire these 3 tranches of bonds, reducing our absolute debt load and further strengthening our balance sheet. Now turning to ESG. We recognize the importance of operating with the highest level of environmental responsibility and continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. We flared 0.75% of our gross gas production in the first quarter, a decrease of over 85% from 2019. Flaring is the biggest driver of our CO2 emissions. And while we are happy with our progress on our legacy acreage, we still have significant work to do on our recently acquired positions as we move to reduce our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% from 2019 levels by 2024. We've also committed to reducing our methane intensity by 70% over the same time frame. In the first quarter, we continued spending capital to retrofit our older tank batteries with air pneumatic devices as gas pneumatics account for 50% of our methane emissions. We also signed a contract to conduct quarterly flyovers of all of our tank batteries to more frequently check for equipment leaks, improving our maintenance practices. Our Net Zero Now initiative is also underway, which means every hydrocarbon molecule produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have 0 net Scope 1 carbon emissions from January 1, 2021 forward. While we recognize we still had a carbon footprint, we have already purchased carbon credits to offset remaining emissions and ultimately plan to be a fast follower in investing in income-generating projects here in the United States that will more directly offset these remaining Scope 1 emissions. To finish, the first quarter was busy and productive. We generated substantial free cash flow, kept our capital and operating costs down, extended debt maturities, added Tier 1 inventory and divested noncore assets. All the while, our strategy remains the same : operate in a prudent and sustainable manner, spend maintenance capital to hold production flat and use future free cash flow to return cash to shareholders and reduce debt. With these comments complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Quite, you and the team, a bit emphatic about what I would call macro speaking that the world really does not need any more oil growth anytime soon. So my question is really pertaining to this. Do you all believe your operational program is as optimal at this lesser pace than if you had a more multi-rig larger frac plan in several of your areas and whether business have much impact on your cash cost? Travis Stice : Sure. I think if you look, Neal, just at our cash cost that we printed this quarter, you would say that there's not been any leakage or any cost pressure that were -- that has translated into execution slippage associated with the lower activity rate. I mean, Neal, if you look at rolling into 2020 before the global pandemic hit, we were running 23 drilling rigs and, I don't know, 8 or 9 frac spreads. That was a pretty quick pace. And I've actually been really pleased with -- as that pace was reduced, in some cases, dramatically last year. Even as we've entered into this year, we really seem to be at a pretty efficient frontier in both rig activity and frac spreads with 11 rigs and 3 to 4 frac spreads. So I think if you just keep watching our numbers that we print, I think that will be a good indicator of whether or not we're being efficient. And certainly, for the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter also, the numbers really look strong. Neal Dingmann : No, I agree. I agree. Okay. And then now that Guidon and QEP are in the books, I'm just wondering, could you or Kaes comment anything you all see that's different or surprised you from the assets? Maybe specifically, if you all still believe there's as many quality locations? And how do you sort of rank that inventory versus existing? Travis Stice : Yes. Certainly, that narrative hasn't changed at all. In fact, it's probably gotten a little bit better. And I'll tell you, I was very complementary of the QEP team at acquisition announcement time and again, during our February call and our April update. Operationally, they were doing some really efficient things. And just looking at the drilling report this morning, QEP's always use water-based mud. And Diamondback now, we've adopted it and we're on our first or second well with water-based drilling fluids that quite honestly, QEP is helping us with. And so far, really, really impressed with the improved efficiency using water-based mud. So that's been a nice add to what I thought was already a really efficient Diamondback legacy operations team. This looks to be a little bit of a stairstep in the right direction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Travis, I guess the shoe is on the other foot this time with Diamondback on the other side of marketing assets. I wanted to get your thoughts. Obviously, you guys have the data room for the Bakken sale. You sold some noncore Permian assets as well. What is your sense of the A&D market today? We've seen a couple of very large Permian trades, DoublePoint and Vitol. And I guess I wanted to get your sense of, do you see more of these private-to-public trades occurring this year? And what criteria that Diamondback will use to evaluate A&D activity? Travis Stice : Certainly, we were really pleased with the interest in the Bakken divestiture process. Now granted, we were the beneficiaries of commodity price run-up and some previously announced deals in the Bakken that I think put some wind at our backs. So that -- I think that piece of the A&D still seems to be pretty frothy, particularly on the PDP-focused type of divestitures, a lot of interest in that. But specific to what Diamondback is looking for on a go-forward basis, we still remain very resolute in our strategy that it's got to meet internal objectives like free cash flow, and it's got to be return accretive on a per share basis. And when you look at the combination, we've got to accelerate return of free cash flow. The larger trades that -- particularly the ones that you referenced, it's -- the quality of assets that fit for capital in Diamondback's top quartile are probably fewer than greater. And the prices that were recently announced on some of those trades might have coiled some of the activity for a little while anyway. But I think as long as we can demonstrate that were being accretive on a per share basis and that we're accelerating return of free cash flow, we're going to continue to look in the Permian Basin. But the opportunity set is pretty narrow right now. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : But most importantly, there has to be inventory that competes for capital right away, right? We -- while this industry has moved towards financial metrics, that can't be the only numbers that we look at when we think about what makes sense in terms of an acquisition and sticking inventory in the bottom quartile or bottom half of our existing inventory just doesn't make sense to us from a returns perspective. Arun Jayaram : Makes sense. Kaes, I'd love to get your thoughts on the updated inventory disclosure, quite a few changes here. It looks like in terms of -- focusing on the Midland Basin, you increased your inventory count by just over 150 net locations. I know that the lateral lengths increased a little bit and perhaps, the Delaware declines just reflect some of the A&D activity. But give us some thoughts on the updated inventory kind of snapshots, kind of the key takeaways. And I do sense that you perhaps are using a little bit wider spacing for some of the acquired assets from QEP and Guidon? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. That's right. We hadn't posted a full inventory update since the beginning of 2020. So this was the first update post the 2 deals. I'd say, generally, we spend a lot of time looking at our development as well as offset development, particularly in the Midland Basin. And I mean, I think our focus is the best zones can still handle kind of 660-foot spacing, which is as tight as we've kind of ever gotten. But we kind of realized that maybe the secondary zone should be spaced a bit wider. And so that's reflected in that inventory numbers we've put out. So secondary zones that are getting codeveloped with the primary zone, which we still think is the right thing to do, are getting spaced at 5 to 7 wells a section rather than kind of 7 to 8, which is the best zones. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Taking a look at the slides here, you show at a $60 WTI price in reference to this driver in your script of north of $1.4 billion of free cash flow before the dividend this year. But this year, you are burdened by hedges. I was curious if you could provide some perspective around what open EBITDA would look like in that type of environment. And then also your perspective on use of proceeds of all this free cash flow and the asset sales, your framework around returning some of this excess capital to shareholders. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. That's a good question, Neil. We're probably sitting on about $450 million or $500 million of hedge losses for the rest of the year at strip today for the balance sheet. So that's the drag on free cash this year. I think it's fortunate that we are losing money on hedges compared to where we were a year ago, but unfortunate that we do have to write the checks. But overall, I think if you add that number back to the free cash number, you can get a pretty clean look at what the future might hold on an unhedged basis. Neil Mehta : That's great. And that ties into the follow-up around capital returns. Talk about how quickly you can get to the leverage levels that you're targeting. And then there are a lot of different options at that point, right? You could think about a buyback, you can think about a variable dividend. Recognizing it's too early to commit to that until you hit your debt target, just walk us through your framework about the different options that are at your disposal. Travis Stice : Yes. Sure, Neil. I think it's good for our industry that we continue to talk about investors recouping a return for the money that they've asked us to deploy. I think that's good for our industry. And you're right about reaching certain debt targets and these announcements that we laid out yesterday to simply accelerate the time frame at which we can hit those debt targets. I think the callable debt reduction of $1.2 billion or more by the end of this year is going to put us in a favorable position to start talking about what the next step is. I also think that our industry has seen a lot of interest in laying out a formula for how capital allocation is going to go or capital allocation and returns to shareholders is going to go. And I wish that our industry was as simple that you could put a formula in place, and formulas work as long as the world doesn't change. But in our business and a commodity-based business, we know that our world does change. So I'm always a little leery of trying to promise delivery on a formula when we know the world is going to change. But the options are very clear. The strategy around the variable dividend is part of the future discussions at the Board level, as is share buybacks, and most importantly, like we've always committed to, continue to lean into our base dividend. So we're very pleased that we're able to accelerate our debt reduction targets with kind of a very positive divestiture number. And we're going to continue to deliver on -- through our performance and try to avoid making promises multiple quarters in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Travis, after the QEP deal, you suggested that your breakeven to sustain your production would potentially move lower. Just wonder if you could give an update in light of your comments around synergies last night as to where you see that settling out. Travis Stice : Well, certainly, the synergies that were in excess of what we promised stem from the refinancing of the locked QEP's debt. I think we talked $40 million. We didn't even describe that as a synergy at acquisition announcement time. The specifics around lowering the breakeven cost has to do with our capital allocation of moving rigs into this newly acquired acreage, both Guidon and QEP. And while I can't formulaically give you dollars and cents how much our breakeven cost has come down, we do know that doing higher cash flow-generating projects at higher rate of return is going to translate to a lower breakeven cost. Doug Leggate : Okay. It seems to us you've won by about $1 or $2, but we'll take that off-line. My follow-up is also related to I guess some of the comments at the time of the QEP deal related to infrastructure and maybe the opportunity to drop or look at dropping down some assets to Rattler and maybe some royalty opportunities for Viper. I'm just wondering if you got any update you can share as to how you're thinking about that. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Doug, there's not a lot on the Viper side to drop down at the Diamondback today. QEP and Guidon, they, in different ways -- QEP is on a lot of large landowners in the Permian that have been around for a long time and not looking to sell their minerals, and Guidon had a sister company like a Viper that was buying minerals. So on the Viper side, we're certainly sourcing minerals at the Viper level under QEP and Guidon acreage, but there won't be a drop down. And then on the Rattler side, QEP, we've been pretty vocal that QEP did a really good job on infrastructure. I think we've learned a lot on the recycling side from them, who's going to boost our Midland Basin recycling program significantly. And eventually, those assets should probably be long in Rattler, but I think it's going to take a few more quarters for us to get that -- all that worked on and then eventually, drop it down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Every quarter, efficiency gains are achieved. Where do you think you are in that learning curve? And are you trying any new technologies that could prove to be beneficial for future improvements? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Gail, I mean, I think Travis kind of said it earlier in the call, but bringing the QEP team in the fold, just like when we brought Energen in the fold, we don't need to be the best, we just want to learn from the people that we add to the team. And we learned a lot from Energen, and then we recently just learned a lot from QEP. So as Travis was mentioning, water-based mud on the drilling side, some drill-out techniques on larger pads that are saving us some time. On the cementing side, I think we've learned that we can batch drill and batch cement, which saves us time, and this all reduces time on location and increases the efficiencies, which is why Danny's team on the drilling side is getting kind of ahead of the 2021 program early in the year, which I think is positive. Travis Stice : Gail, back at the Energen announcement time, I think I used the phrase that we checked our egos at the door when we brought the Energen team on board. And this is just really -- as Kaes highlighted, this is another example of checking your egos at the door, and let's just try to figure out what's the best way to do this for our shareholders. And really proud of the operations organization. Once again, they've done so. And we've not really had the QEP team inside the fold for very long, but that they're already making a very positive influence. Gail Nicholson : And then circling back to the inventory. With the improvement in oil prices, Do the secondary zone see a potential uptick in capital allocation in '22 forward? Or should we still be assuming that the primary zones are the target for the foreseeable future? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think just generally, we're very focused on co-development between zones, particularly in the Midland Basin, and the secondary zones get spaced a little wider. I think, Gail, we did a lot of work at various oil prices on inventory and spacing and EUR per foot. And we kind of found that the benefit to IRR outweighs any benefit to NPV from going tighter. So no one got mad at you for drilling wells that were too good. And so I think we're going to stick with that strategy, particularly with how much undeveloped acreage we got with the QEP and Guidon deals. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Just curious, the deal with QEP only closed, I guess, about 7 weeks ago now. As we think about your development plans on those assets, when would be like a decision point where we might see a shift of activity either more towards county line or some other areas that you're learning from that might have surprised you with what you're seeing today versus pre-deal so we could start thinking about how '22 looks? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. David, I think you start to see that in terms of the wells that we're going to be drilling now, but you won't see it in terms of production until kind of Q4 '21, early '22. I think we're trying to get as many rigs as we can in the Robertson Ranch/Sale Ranch area in South Central, Martin County, some big pads and efficient development going to be headed that direction. Rigs are there right now. I think when it comes to kind of county line in the northern part of Martin County, we've done a lot of technical review with the QEP team and our team, and they've done some things in the shallower zones that we like, some targets that we like in the county line area. So I think you'll see more of the Wolfcamp A, Middle Spraberry, Dean, LS work in the county line area and then more of the deeper Wolfcamp and Lower Spraberry in the Robertson Ranch area. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And if I could just ask one on just the capital program this year. Just curious, like relative to your guidance on footage cost of $520 to $580 in the Midland and $720 to $800 in the Del, where you guys are today? Because as I look at the rest of the year, it seems to certainly be implying like a back half-weighted program. Does that stairstep up each quarter now going into the end of the year? Because I guess we're thinking about sort of like the sustaining quarterly run rate that we should expect going into next year. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. That's a good question as well. I think I'll take the well costs first. We put a lot of look at well costs in the deck. Midland Basin was around $530 a foot, and Delaware was actually below the low end of the guide, which I think was just a really good quarter operationally, a little lower sample size as well. But as you think, we did put out Q1 CapEx of $300 million in Q2, implying $375 million at the midpoint. So that would imply we're going to spend $1 billion in the back half of the year. And I would say there's certainly some conservatism on our side. We've been very vocal that we will cut CapEx to keep production flat rather than grow production and spend more dollars. But the ancillary stuff, environmental, infrastructure, midstream, non-op is going to pick up a bit in the middle of the second half of the year, and that, on top of the couple of quarters of true pro forma QEP and Guidon and Diamondback activity, will result in capital coming up slightly throughout the year. But yes, we're off to a pretty good start in the first half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on your transactions. Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, following up on the earlier A&D question, but taking it a slightly different direction. In your view, did that larger transaction tilt the environment to a seller's market? And if so, would it make sense to pursue smaller divestitures to further improve your balance sheet? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : That's a good question. Certainly, the market has improved dramatically, and that's why we kicked off that -- the Upton County process and the non-op New Mexico process that, we thought in the back of our minds, were sale candidates for years, but the last 12 months have not been conducive to selling cash flow. I think the trend, Derrick, is that a lot of private capital has moved towards buying PDP-heavy assets and distributing that cash flow to their LPs or to their shareholders. And when everyone's doing that, you have a lot of competitive tension in the process. And so that allowed us to get pretty competitive bids on all 3 assets, and we're pretty happy. But I think for us, anything else that's a sale candidate in the Permian has real undeveloped value, and that's not something we're looking to sell right now because I think the market for that is less competitive than a PDP-heavy market. Derrick Whitfield : That makes sense. And Travis, for my follow-up, I'd like to pick up on a comment from my discussion yesterday. As you guys progress your plans to invest in income-generating projects that will more directly offset Scope 1 emissions, could you speak to the nature of your industry discussion since Q4 and how that plan might take shape longer term at Diamondback? Travis Stice : Yes. Specifically, for Diamondback, we talked about CCUS technology and emerging trends with that. I think a good analogy for our Diamondback shareholders would be to see how Rattler participated alongside subject matter experts on long-haul pipe. We don't expect to become subject matter experts in income-generating projects, CCUS type projects. But we do anticipate aligning ourselves with those that are -- those experts and try to do those technologies. That is -- those emerging technologies are not months or -- they're quarters away. And there are things that -- there's new technology emerging, and we're trying to stay abreast of it. And when I talk to my industry peers, it's a very similar tact that they're taking as well, too, is to try to be extremely fast followers and figure out what emerging technology needs you need to lean into the soonest. But I think it's an industry trend for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Heikkinen : Any thoughts on a drop-down of your QEP Midstream assets or formerly QEP assets into Rattler and timing of that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. David, it's certainly on the schedule. The other activity is getting Bakken sold and getting the refinancing done took priority, but the team is doing their work. I think as you think about the drop-down, we're going to have a very large block across half of Martin County, and so we want to get the engineering right and also build out recycling infrastructure across that block to be able to store, produce water and reuse it in the Midland Basin. So I think it's a couple of quarters away, but certainly, it's on the docket. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I wanted to follow up a little bit on your comments around synergies. You guys talked about that you're ahead of expectations of the $60 million to $80 million. Clearly, you pointed out the debt refinance split. Perhaps maybe you could talk a little bit more to kind of the G&A and the operational synergies. Are we going to start to see those numbers show up as soon as second quarter earnings when you report? Do these come more in the second half of the year? And can you maybe provide a little bit of color just on the operational synergies and specifically, where those will come from? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Leo, I think we predicated the deal primarily on G&A and interest. QEP was a low-cost operator just like Diamondback. So unlike Energen, we didn't come out and say, \"Hey, we're going to drill 2,000 wells $200 a foot cheaper.\" But the G&A stuff will start to show in Q3 and Q4. And obviously, the interest has happened today. I think there's probably some upside on the operational front when -- if and when a drop-down happens at Rattler, and being able to connect all of our midstream systems without spending extra capital to add that capacity could be an upside surprise. Travis Stice : And also, Leo, just operational, what we talked already on this call about the water-based mud, using big rigs for drill-out, some of the other cementing practices that Diamondback is now adopting from QEP learnings, those all translate directly to lower dollars per foot, and that's -- those are direct synergies as well. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just on the LOE side, you guys certainly spoke to just great cost control in the first quarter. Certainly couldn't help but to notice that your first quarter LOE was below your full year guidance despite the fact that we had a, call it, 100-year storm in the first quarter. So certainly, you guys -- looks like you guys are doing a good job executing in the field. Do you guys feel like you're maybe set up to come in a little bit below that LOE guidance for the year? Or are you going to see an uptick once the QEP and Guidon assets kind of take full effect here in the second quarter? Daniel Wesson : Leo, it's Danny. The LOE in the first quarter, we certainly saw some surprising benefits throughout the year during first quarter from some electrical contracts and other things throughout the storm. We do expect that we'll see a little bit of increase from that number from the Guidon and QEP assets. Mostly the Guidon assets have a little bit higher lifting cost than what we've traditionally seen at Diamondback. But we like the low end of that guide right now. And as we learn kind of more about the assets and where their lifting cost is going to settle as we get them integrated, we'll update the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Richard Tullis with Capital One Securities. Richard Tullis : Just one question for me, kind of following up on the earlier ESG discussion. And you mentioned, Travis, in your opening comments about being the fast follower in the investment side. So you generated strong free cash flow, and it certainly looks like that continue given where commodity prices are. How large of a part of the FANG story could investment in renewables or CCUS type projects or entities develop into, say, over the next 2, 3 years? Travis Stice : Yes. That's a fair question, Richard. But I just -- I don't know what that number is going to look like yet. There's too much that's still emerging in the form of new technology development. And I know it's important, but in terms of what percentage of our capital is going to be allocated towards that, I'm not comfortable communicating that yet because it's -- quite honestly, we don't know what that answer is. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean I think what's most important, Richard, is if our Scope 1 emissions go down, you have less incentive or need to invest on the other side to offset it, right? So today, $15 million a year is going into the tank battery side. And I think we put out some new numbers that we're going to replace 200 generators in the field this year and move that to line power. We're then moving towards a Scope 2 emissions number and how we're going to get that down through sourcing electricity through renewable sources. So while Travis says we're going to be a fast follower on the investment side, we're certainly going to be a leader in terms of spending dollars in the field to clean up and reduce our intensity on what we can control. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : A quick one for me and then maybe a more open-ended one. You guys -- you've sold or agreed to sell close to $1 billion worth of assets, but your CapEx guidance is unchanged. So does that mean that you essentially had de minimis CapEx on those assets that you're divesting? Or is there some reallocation going on? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : No. It just means they were noncore, Charles. The key to an asset sale is does that asset compete for capital with the rest of your assets, and these 3 assets did not. I'd say some of the New Mexico acreage was really good acreage. But we're not a non-op producer. So we sold stuff that sits lower in the inventory ranking, and we're going to reinvest it at this time to pay down debt and generate free cash to return to shareholders. Charles Meade : Got it. And then Travis, if I could go back to comments in your prepared remarks. You've mentioned before how oil inventories, global oil inventories and also U.S. inventories are looking in -- looking better, but we're still looking at some supply artificially being withheld from the market by OPEC+. I want to understand a little bit more of your thinking because in my way of looking at things, if you wait until OPEC+ has 0 barrels off-line, at that point, we're probably in a spike scenario. And I don't think you maybe need to wait that long. And so maybe it's not a binary thing that you have to wait until OPEC spare supply is 0. But can you tell me about how it looks from your point of view? And what any threshold or series of thresholds would be? Travis Stice : Yes. Certainly, I wish most of the decisions that I had to answer were binary, yes or no type of questions, and this is not one of those. Just from a macro perspective, you know that OPEC+ is effectively controlling the market right now, and it's having an outcome of reduced inventories. And against the backdrop of still a fledgling oil demand recovery, which quite honestly, might be negatively impacted by the unfortunate outbreak in India, it's just still -- in our opinion, it's still too early to be talking about growth. There's no clear signal. Now do we need to get to 0? With OPEC+ being retailed, I don't know that, that's the right answer either. We still got to assimilate 1 million or 1.5 million barrels a day of our and production likely coming back on. So it's an evolving question. But as it pertains to Diamondback, there's no clear signal for us to grow volumes, and it's unlikely that you've seen any of those signals this year. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Travis, just curious that you talked about the near-term debt reduction for this year, $1.2 billion. Longer term, what will be the right capital structure or the debt level for Diamondback? Travis Stice : Yes. I think that's certainly an evolving question as well but -- or a revolving answer as well. But certainly, we wanted to get our absolute debt reduced to where we were before the QEP and the Guidon acquisitions, which were almost there. I think in terms of leverage target, of course, leverage is a function of EBITDA, a function of oil price. But leverage targets, the Board mandate has had us below 2x since the IPO, and we'll be there now sooner rather than later. I think the longer-term run rate for leverage is probably 1 or below, and it's going to take multiple quarters for us to get there, but certainly encouraged with the way our forward outlook plan looks and our debt retirement strategy. Paul Cheng : Just curious of that because I think that's one school of thought in a highly volatile sector like oil and gas. The best hedge is actually not for the paper market hedging program, but using a fortress-like balance sheet. So on that basis that -- will Diamondback be interested or consider to drive the net debt down to a really low level so that you can get away from the hedging program totally and also position yourself to be much stronger and have far more flexibility and opportunity when you get to the next downturn? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Paul, I mean, I don't know if that's an either/or answer, right? I think it's an and answer. And like Travis was saying, I think something like a turn of permanent leverage at high 40s WTI is a pretty good hedge, natural hedge for the next downturn, but I think you also need some sort of put protection or big insurance policy that if things go really south like they did in 2020, you're still protected. So I think it's a combination. I think hedges will still be a part of our story, particularly with a growing dividend and investors demanding capital be returned to them. You have to protect that cash flow. The only way you can in the paper market, you might do a wire collar or buy puts that are pretty cheap. But I think, again, it's kind of an and discussion. Paul Cheng : And with your structure in Rattler, with more than 7% dividend yield there, so strategically, does it really have the benefit for you to keep it as an independent entity and drop down assets there? I mean does it really gain anything from a capital efficiency standpoint? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Well, we sold everything we had in that business for 29% of the business. So I think for Diamondback shareholders, the IPO of Rattler was certainly a win. I think we have to look at the subsidiaries consistently in the lens of what's the best thing for Diamondback shareholders and what's the best thing for the shareholders of the subsidiaries. Fortunately, we've created these vehicles without major conflicts of interest. And traditionally, they traded at higher multiples than the parent. So they've been, I'd say, successful investments. But yes, we got to think about what those -- what value those add. I think in an acquisitive environment, they've added value. And I guess, if we're acquiring less, we'll have to reassess that. But right now, they're still strategic, and we have a lot of value for Diamondback shareholders sitting in the stock of those two companies. Paul Cheng : Okay. All right. Final question for me. Can you discuss the process when you sell the Bakken asset? Maybe we are wrong, but when we're looking at the future strip, that for the next 12 months, the Bakken asset that you sold should be able to generate EBITDA of about $250 million to $300 million. So it looked like you sell for 2.5 to 3x turn. That seems a bit low. So just trying to understand the process. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think the process was very competitive. This was an asset that wasn't going to be getting capital from us. So I think, Paul, we were very vocal that the Bakken was going to be held for sale. I'm personally very pleased with the price we received. It seems like in the fall, everyone was saying, \"Oh, you can't sell anything for better than PDP, PV-15.\" And like I said earlier in the call, I think this industry can't move towards only looking at financial metrics. NPV and NAV still matter. They probably play a lower role than they did in the past. But financial metrics alone isn't going to be the reason why we sell an asset we deem noncore when we did an acquisition a couple of months ago. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again, everyone, for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentations there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advice that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Chelsea [ph]. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, CEO; and Kaes Van't Hof, CFO and Daniel Wesson, EVP of Operations. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. Diamondback had an outstanding second quarter extending its track record of operational excellence. I am proud of everything our teams been able to accomplish this year by pushing the boundaries of our current thought processes and embracing new technologies and playbooks, many of which have come from the personnel we've added through our acquisitions. Nowhere is that more evident than on drilling and completion side of the business, where we continue to lower costs and improve cycle times. We\u2019ve decreased our drill times for the spud to total depth of over 30% and are averaging just over 10 days to drill a two-mile wells in the Permian -- in the Midland basin. On the completion side, we're now running a three simul-frac crews, which lower our downtime and improve our pad efficiencies. We are currently completing approximately 2800 lateral feet per day in the Midland basin, an improvement of nearly 70% as compared to our early zipper-frac designs.  All of these operational advances translate to our ability to do more with less. We are seeing some inflation on diesel, steel and other materials, our ability to continually improve operationally and become more efficient has more than offset these cost increases and/or leading-edge D, C&E cost continue to be at the low end of our guidance range. As a result, we're decreasing the number of rigs and crews we need to execute this year's capital plan and are reducing our full-year capital guidance by $100 million or down 6% from prior expectations. On the production side, our wells have outperformed expectations this year. As a result, we are slightly increasing our Permian oil production guidance, which should not be taken as a conscious decision to grow. As we look at supply and demand fundamentals, oil supply is still purposefully being withheld from the market and we continue to believe there's not a call on U.S. shale production growth. We will continue therefore to target flat oil production for the foreseeable future and plan to do that by completing less wells than originally planned this year. These operational highlights coupled with a supportive macro backdrop led to record free cash flow generation for Diamondback. During the second quarter, we generated $578 million in free cash flow or $3.18 per diluted share. To put this into perspective, we entered 2021 anticipating roughly this amount of free cash flow for the full year. We've already put this cash to work by calling and paying down over $600 million of callable debt so far this year with over $600 million more expected later this year when our 2023 notes become callable. In total, this debt reduction will reduce cash interest expense by almost $40 million annually. We continue to emphasize that reducing debt and increasing shareholder returns are not mutually exclusive. And we proved this point again by increasing our quarterly dividend by 12.5% from $0.40 a share to $0.45 a share or $1.80 annualized. This put this puts our year-to-date dividend growth at 20% above 2020 levels. At Diamondback, we prefer to talk about our current performance rather than future promises. However, our performance has allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our base dividend. And we now feel it's appropriate to put up some goal posts as it relates to additional return of capital in 2022 given the current free cash flow outlook at strip pricing. Our plan is to distribute 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in 2022. This form of additional capital return will be decided by the board at the appropriate time, but we intend to be flexible based on which opportunities we believe present the best return to our stockholders, the owners of our company. Remember, our strategy is unchanged since 2018 when we initiated our base dividend. This additional clarity is simply a evolution of our guidance and also reflective of the maturation of our business. A lot can happen now between now and the end of the year, but we feel we are well positioned to take advantage of the current commodity price environment and deliver differential free cash flow in 2022. Our capital efficiency improvement allows us to maintain an elevated base level of Permian oil production through 2022 by spending approximately $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion of total capital. The continued improvement in a realized pricing and our low cash cost structure combined to form a best-in-class cash margin, which we plan to protect as we layer on hedges that are focused on protecting extreme downside allowing our shareholders to participate in commodity price upside. Turning to ESG. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives. Flaring continues to be one of the biggest drivers of our CO2 emissions. And while we've made significant progress since 2019, we still have work to do. Our target in 2021 is to flare less than 1% of gross gas produced and in the first half of the year we were above that number. Now this is primarily due to the integration of the QEP assets and we expect this metric to improve as we build out additional infrastructure in the Midland basin and close the Williston divestiture later this quarter. We have also begun two pilot projects utilizing tankless and limited tank facility designs. While the first tankless facility is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter. We've already had two successful limited tank design pilots. On average this design reduced our CO2 emissions from our storage tanks by more than 90%. Because of this success, we've elected to extend this pilot to another five facilities in the back half of this year and expand to an additional 15 facilities in 2022. Lastly, we are continuing to build out our electrical substations, which will help minimize emissions from combustion equipment, primarily generators and gas engine driven compressors. We are working to remove or replace over 200 of these units by 2023. The combination of these efforts positioned us well to meet our commitment of reducing our Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduce our methane intensity by at least 70% as compared to 2019 figures by 2024. The second quarter exceeded our expectations and exemplified why Diamondback is a leader in the industry. Our people continue to innovate, making us more environmentally responsible and efficient uniquely positioning us for the future. Our record free cash flow generation allowed us to accelerate our debt pay down and increase our dividend all the while positioning us for robust shareholder returns next year. We are delivering on our exploit and return strategy, continuing to focus on maintaining Permian oil volumes, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning, Travis and team. Travis, I want to start a little bit maybe away from the print. But to get a little bit of your thoughts on kind of the A&D market. We sensed a bit of a fear factor regarding your stock and the potential for Diamondback to engage in larger scale M&A with some of the larger packages apparently on the block. So, I just wanted to maybe you could start and maybe remind investors on your approach to A&D? And how you kind of balance, call it the general scarcity of Tier 1 opportunities in the A&D market versus just economics and returns? Travis Stice : Sure. A lot of questions contained in there. But just generally, it feels like a seller's market out there. Our M&A focus is really intense around selling non-core assets. And look, one of the most important jobs that we have as management is allocating capital. And when you look at kind of a mid-cycle oil price and we kind of use 50 [ph], 15 for NGLs and $2 for gas. The NAV of our stock prices is much higher than where we are today. So, if that backdrop persists, best use of our capital is not in the M&A market, it's rather in the -- even buying back our own stock. But look, we've been very clear what forms, what our decision framework and our acquisition frameworks look like. And we've articulated that in every earnings call. But today, just doesn't feel like that's the right thing to do. So well focus is simply around monetizing non-core assets and really looking hard at our business. So I really like the way our forward plan looks with our existing inventories. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up. You did raise your production guidance for the back half of the year relative to consensus and kind of our model if you -- even if you back out the Bakken. I was wondering, Travis and team, you comment on what drove that? And just general, your expectations around 2022? It sounds like we're -- it's a 1.8 billion to hold, call it, 220 [ph] flat next year, but I just want to get your sense around your second half outlook and thoughts around 2022? Travis Stice : Yes. I'll take this year first. We are going to close the bakken a little bit later than we expected due to external approvals. And so therefore, we kind of raised our full year guide by about 2500 barrels a day, which is two months of the bakken contribution. But above that we also raised our overall guide for the year up 2% and that's really on an apples-to-apples basis versus our Q1 guide. And really I think impetus for that is some Permian outperformance early in the year. And therefore, I think we're comfortable raising our Permian guidance on oil to 218 to 222 from 216 to 220. And as Travis said, we're not in growth mode, but the wells this year have outperformed and we've cut more capital on the CapEx side than we have raised the production side. So, generally completing 10 fewer wells this year than originally planned in the Permian production up a couple percent, but more importantly, capital down 6% or 7% from where we were before. And that translates to the 2022 plan, which is you know in dark pencil right now. But flat is kind of the case we're modeling. And I think generally holding that 218,000 to 222,000 barrels a day and the Permian flat with as little capital as possible is how we see it today. This -- the number we posted yesterday kind of bakes in a little bit of service cost inflation as we know our business partners on that side are going to be able to push price a little bit. But generally really excited about a high Midland basin percentage of wells completed next year that keeps production flat in a very capital efficient manner. Arun Jayaram : Super helpful. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thank you, Arun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Thank you. Travis, maybe we could start on the 50% 2022 number that you threw out there in terms of the return of cash flow. And do you see the potential for that to grow over time as balance sheet strengthens? And then any early thoughts in terms of what the right mechanism is to return that capital, whether it's through dividends or buybacks especially with the stock yielding the free cash flow yield that it is right now? Travis Stice : Yes. Certainly, what we try to do is allow the flexibility to make that decision when that point occurs. Because we want to make that decision on what creates the greatest return for our shareholders. And if you look at 2022 and you have plus 20% free cash flow yield, that would tend to think it's a more of a stock buyback. But look, we're going to maintain flexibility and try to do what we've always done which create the framework that generates the greatest shareholder returns. And what that number does over time? Look, Neil, I couldn't be more excited about the forward outlook of the company. Our -- what -- even like I said at that mid-cycle oil price and break-even cost of around $32 a barrel, we're making a lot of really good free cash flow on a daily basis as we look out into the future. And we'll make that decision when that cash comes through the doors as to what we're going to do with it. But we've signaled very clearly an evolution in our guidance by talking about you know 50% going back to the shareholders. And that that evolution and guidance is also reflective of a maturation of our business. Neil Mehta : And Travis, can you talk a little bit about the cost structure of the business. How do you see that evolving over time, not only the back half of the year, but as you get into 2022, and all the different moving pieces as it relates to both cost and capital efficiency? Travis Stice : I have to be honest. Our operations organization just continues to just surprise me. I mean, we were -- yes, I feel like we're already the best and doing what we do out here and drilling and completing these wells. And these guys came up with some clear fluid drilling technology that that came over quite honestly from the QEP acquisition. And they've knocked out significant cost. I think it's on slide 10 of our deck. And that just continues to surprise me. Because we're able to back out capital in the next six months of the year, because improve capital efficiencies against the backdrop of increasing cost of goods and services. I don't know that it's reasonable, but you can always forecast efficiencies going up and cost going down and certainly I don't think it's prudent to issue guidance that way. But I'm really impressed with the way our organization continues to lean into doing more with less. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I think, generally, the step change that the team has made in drilling times is going to be permanent, right? And that's going to stay with us through 2022 and beyond. And basically we can do -- what we once had to do with ten rigs with eight now in the Midland basin. And that's where the majority of our capitals can be allocated for the foreseeable future. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Kaes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Morning, guys. My first question is also around your comment of your plan to return 50% of free cash flow next year. Really, Travis or Kaes, I'm just wondering -- I'm wondering, will this be more of a backward looking formula or I guess more specifically what approach will you all use for determining the timing and the type of shareholder return? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Neal, good question. I think it come -- really comes down to a variable dividend or share buyback. I think if it's a variable dividend, it'll be backward looking the quarter that we announced will pay for the quarter prior. But if it's a buyback, I think we'll do a little math on how much free cash we're generating essentially per day and buyback that much tough [ph] on a consistent basis. So I think the board and Travis are very focused on which one of those provides the best return to shareholders at the time. And I don't think the answers one or the other for a permanent period of time. There's going to be flexibility to go between those. I think the only thing that is sacrosanct is the base dividend and continuing to grow the base dividend. Neal Dingmann : Great. Glad you're staying flexible there. And then my second question pertains to your comment in the release over the flat 2022 production expectation versus the 4Q with the just slightly higher spin. I guess on that, what I understand some of this is driven by a change of ducts and QEP going for -- a QEP and Guidon I should say going forward. Could you speak to your expectations for 2022 baseline production decline? And maybe the rig and frac spreads involved in this and any other notable drivers sort of that your expectations you're using to achieve this? Travis Stice : Yes. So, I'll start with the with the number, 10% to 15% more capital, while that's an increase versus this year. I think what's forgotten is that Guidon and QEP closed at the end of Q1, so we didn't have a full quarter of their capital contribution. So, that's a portion of the 10% to 15% increase I'd say about half of it. And also the other half is, we did have a nice DUC benefit if you see, we're completing 270 wells and drilling 220 this year. So that's about another $100 million benefit. Because when we're running as many rigs as we were into the downturn, we decided to not pay early termination fees and instead build the DUC backlog, which was the best use of investor dollars at the time and we're taking advantage of that a little bit this year. So, I think generally from a crew and rig count perspective, we dropped two rigs this quarter. We'll probably bring those two rigs back. But we'll probably need somewhere around 11 or 12 rigs next year and three simul-frac crews and maybe a fourth spot crew to execute on that plan, which is a testament to how efficient the operations team has gotten here. Neal Dingmann : Very good. Thanks for the details. Travis Stice : Thanks Neal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Nicholson with Stephens. Gail Nicholson : Good morning. You guys have demonstrated a very strong commitment to ESG. On the water recycling front, you're sadly above the 2021 target already. Can you just talk about the future progression of water recycling? And can you remind me of the potential cost savings that exists in that world? Travis Stice : Yes. That's an important question. I think we are above our target so far this year with the shift to the Midland basin. We are going to need to build out some permanent infrastructure on the recycling side to be able to not only recycle the water, but also store produced water, so that we're not using --our freshwater intensity will go down on the Midland basin side. That process is underway. I expect that we have a nice solid connected system across kind of our sale, Robertson Ranch and Martin County positions by the middle to the end of next year. And that's going to allow us to up that number significantly. So, we've used 100% recycled water in the Delaware basin. Usually you're just pulling off the existing system. But on the Midland side you have less water production. So I think storing that produced water and being able to use it and reuse it downhaul is the next step in the evolution. And that should allow that target percentage to come up pretty dramatically over the next couple years. Gail Nicholson : Great. And then on the electrification, efforts that you guys are doing. Can you talk about thoughts on the utilization of electric fracs fleets and drilling rigs? And then on the electrical substation work, there is an LOE benefit to that as well, correct? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean, the electrical substation work is pretty obvious by inspection. Because not only is it positive for ESG and run times, but it costs it costs significantly less than in field power generation. So, we've been working on that for the last few years. Now I think generally we've been ready to take power. It's taken a little bit of time for the co-ops to get to us. But by the end of this year, I think we'll line of sight to all of our major fields being on infield electrification. The issue we have on the frac and the drilling side is I think we're testing some drilling rigs on line power. They don't use up as much power as a frac crew. I think right now our frac crews are more focused on dual fuel and Tier 4 engine capabilities versus tying into line power. And I'll ask Danny if you want to add anything to that. Daniel Wesson : I think that's right. We on the efrac side of things, the issues generally been on the power generation side and how do we provide enough power to the fleet to running. There's some stuff -- our friends on the server side are working on hard to solve that issue. But we're certainly watching it close. And hope to be advancing there in the next couple years. Gail Nicholson : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Leggett with Bank of America. Doug Leggett : Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Guys, one of the easiest ways to return value to investors is to pay down debt. Where do you see the right absolute level of debt when you consider the free cash flow you're throwing off right now? Travis Stice : Yes. That that's a good question. I think in the near term, paying off our 2023s and having enough cash to pay off our 2024s by kind of into next year, two years ahead of schedule, is feels like a very good place to be, with the break even as low as it is and with the delta between that and current oil prices and us not stepping on the accelerator to grow that does give you more flexibility on the free cash side to build the cash balance and take out these bullet maturities when they come due. But I think in the near term, handling everything prior to 2025 puts us in a really good position. Put this in a gross debt position in the low $4 billions and basically a turn of leverage with a lot of free cash coming to both the shareholders and to debt reduction. Doug Leggett : Great. Thanks for that. And yes, I think slide 10 is terrific. So thank you for including that in the deck. It's kind of my question case I guess is slide 10 my follow-up. If you're not growing production, if you're moving to the sustaining capital certain model for the time being, one has to imagine the underlying decline slows down some. So bottom line is what happens to that $32 break even if you hold the line on production going through the end of 2022? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Travis Stice : Yes. Good question. Also Doug, I think it goes down, albeit less dramatically than it has in the past years. I think oil -- our oil decline rate quarter end to quarter end is kind of in the mid to lower 30s right now. I think it moves down kind of a percent or two a year if we keep continue to stay flat. But then also the other spend on infrastructure and midstream we're going to have a little tick-up in infrastructure and midstream next year with the Sale and Robertson Ranch development that we're going to have that came with no real infrastructure. So that spin comes down as well. So I think, generally we'll keep pushing it down by a buck or two a year. And that gives us a lot of flexibility to do a lot of things with debt pay down and free cash return to shareholders. Doug Leggett : Terrific. Thank Travis. Travis Stice : Thank you, Doug. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. So the base dividend has been a core pathway for Diamondback's return cash to shareholders. So definitely nice to see another bump today. How do you think about the appropriate level for the base dividend over time? Is there a certain percentage of cash flow that you target at a certain oil price? And does this percentage change as you deliver? How do you think about the base dividend? Travis Stice : Yes, Scott. When you go back and look at the way the board has previously communicated this commitment. We've talked about having a base dividend that somewhat approximates the S&P yields. And then anything above that is another form of shareholder return. So that 2.5% something like that base yield is sort of what we target for that base dividend. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I think on top of that, we think about our break even too, right? So as our break even comes down over time that gives you a little more flexibility to pay the dividend right now. 2022 dividend breakeven is at 35 a barrel WTI. As I alluded to in the last question, if the break even comes down a little bit that gives you a little more flexibility on the base, because like we said earlier in the call the base dividend is sacrosanct and that needs to be protected at all costs. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then just turning back to the 2022 plan, at least the maintenance plan. I may have missed it earlier. But is there a TIL count or obviously there will be. But what is the TIL count at the maintenance program given the acquisitions and productivity gains that you guys have seen? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean, it's generally flat to where we are right now and where our pace will be in the second half of the year, I mean, plus or minus a couple of percentage points. But generally, we're in the kind of 65 to 75 TILs a quarter and 75 or 80 of those are going to be in the Midland basin. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Hey, good morning all and congrats on your strong quarter and update. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for Travis or Kaes, regarding your volume outperformance during Q2, are there one to two factors that you would attribute to that production outperformance? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Derrick, I think generally the new wells that that we brought on the legacy Diamondback position are seeing the benefits of the downturn last year and reallocating capital to more on the Midland basin, but two our best returning assets across the portfolio. So generally, we're seeing early time is outperformance there. A good quarter all around. I mean, even the base production base was -- didn't suffer from a lot of weather or unforeseen events. So, I think generally on the positive side the capital efficiency not only on the cost side, but on the performance is improving and we're pretty excited about what the rest of the year and 2022 holds given the development we're going to have on the assets that we acquired from QEP and Guidon. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And as my follow-up perhaps for Travis. How concerned are you with the recent ramp in private activity in the Permian from the perspective of inflationary pressures and from the perspective of a potential breakdown in industry capital discipline? Travis Stice : So, that's a real interesting question, Derrick. there's no doubt that the privates out here in the Permian are really leading into this higher commodity price And notwithstanding the fact that the forward curve is $20 disconnected from today's price. But there's a couple of things that I think should be considered. One is, while some privates do have Tier 1 assets, a lot of the privates or more in the Tier 1.5 or Tier 2-ish and they're not quite as productive. But the reality is that the effect on both Permian production and on costs increases is not zero. It's just going to be -- it's a little bit too early to see what the effect is going to be. But I think the more quarters that pass, where public companies are exercising the discipline of flat production, I think is what our what our industry needs. And the privates will have an impact on the overall equation, but I think the macro element won't really change. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And hopefully the longevity of that impact as well given the depth of inventory and on the private side. Travis Stice : Right. Derrick Whitfield : That's great update and thanks again for your time. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Hey guys, wanted to jump in a little bit to the expense side of the equation here. Certainly, I know that you guys closed QEP and Guidon later in 1Q. But certainly notice that some of your expense items in the second quarter on a per BOE basis kind of picked up versus 1Q? I guess most notably your cash G&A, your LOE and even your transport cost. Just want to get a sense. Where there's some kind of one-time items as you're kind of flushing through the integration here that might have hit some of those numbers in which you should expect the per barrel cost to start to kind of drop and all those categories in the second half. Any help you can give us there? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, surely. Good question. With the addition of the bakken assets, those assets come with a much different cost structure than our traditional Permian assets. So on the LOE and the GP&T side, a little pickup there from the contribution on the bakken -- from the bakken, excuse me. We'll say, Permian LOE still remained in that $4-ish range, so you can get a feel for what the bakken contribution was. In the quarter, I would expect that to continue in Q3. On the G&A side, we did have a transition period for a good amount of the QEP employees. That transition period kind of wanes off in the back half of the year. So I think generally, G&A ticks down slightly in the back half of the year. Leo Mariani : Okay. Now, that's helpful for sure. And I guess just to take a harder look at your production guidance here. Looking at your third quarter oil guide, if I just compare that to kind of your actual second quarter 2021 oil number, it looks like volumes come down a little bit. I know you guys have kind of talked about holding it flat. Is that maybe just kind of some seasonality or just some kind of random variance there in the number. But generally speaking, you're trying to do your best, keep it flat? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I think Q2 was a great quarter Leo. And I think we've been very vocal about no production growth needed from the U.S. So I think we're resetting that baseline back to where we were originally in Q2. So, I think there's a little bit outperformance. And I think like we've said, kind of through the year we'd rather sacrifice capital or cut capital in lieu of growing production. So if you keep beating production estimates and raising your baseline for staying flat, that's really growth. And so, we really don't want that. So generally, I think we're pleased that we can use the 218 to 222 oil baseline for the Permian for Q3 and Q4 into 2022. And hopefully the ops teams continue to outperform expectations and under promise and over deliver a bit. Leo Mariani : Okay. That makes sense. So it sounds like there's some element of you folks, basically had very strong well performance in the last couple quarters, and that's just not something you can necessarily guide to every quarter as well? Travis Stice : That's right. I mean, I think we expect to continue to do well. And we expect continued capital efficiency improvement particularly with the new development we have planned in the Midland basin. But this industry is about under promising and over delivering. Leo Mariani : Now that makes a lot of sense. And then just lastly on asset sales. You folks obviously talked about it being a bit of a seller's market. I know you're working hard on closing the bakken divestiture. But is there anything else in your purview that you're looking to maybe prune late this year or into next year? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean, I think we've had some inbounds on some non-core assets that don't compete for capital in the next 10 years of our development plan. And so, I think generally there is surprisingly a lot of private capital looking to do things again, in E&P what a twist from six or nine months ago. But I think generally if someone wants to pay for value for something that has no value to our shareholders on a PV basis we'll take that call. And I think there's a couple of areas that that might be the case and no guarantees, we're not a for seller, but we would do what's right for our shareholders on selling some of these non-core assets. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks guys. Travis Stice : Thanks Leo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one's on hedging if you just remind us on your philosophy overall there. There's obviously a lot of capacity to add as we look to the back half of the next year with the bulk of the additions earlier in the year which maybe speaks to the strategy already as well as to how the curve sits. But just wanted to get the latest as you continue to improve the balance sheet which obviously serves as a natural projection of volatility as that gets better and better? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Jeff, great question. I think we see the back relation in the curve. So it's hard for us to hedge further out than kind of the next nine to 12 months. So I think generally, we'd like to be close to 50%, 60% hedged late going into a quarter and build that relatively consistently over the three or four quarters prior to that quarter. What we have done is try to keep these wide two-way callers to not take away upside for our investors. And I think as we get closer to quarters and the time value of money goes down some sort of deferred premium puts makes sense to layer on top of the wide two-way callers. I think generally, we feel really good about where the balance sheets going to be at the end of the year. The free cash flow generation even at 50 TI next year. And so that's kind of the downside we're trying to protect. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. Thanks. And then secondly, just wanted to see if there's anything you could dig in on a bit more just on the moving pieces on cost inflation that you spoke to. Just if there's anything incremental you could speak on what's moving currently on the services side of things in particular? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Well, it's been very visible on the steel, diesel side and the raw material side. I think I think generally the steel inflation in our opinion needs to slow down at some point. But I think that -- the cost inflation is going to flip to the more service oriented lines on the labor side and on the pieces of the service world that that go up with recount. So I think we've held off long enough on that front. And I think the service industry is able to push a little price here on that side. But I think most importantly what we've done on the Midland basin side is the lowering of days to TD has counteracted any of that increase so far. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis and Kaes, and the rest of the team there. I'd like to ask one more question maybe from a different direction on that on the 50% of cash -- free cash return to shareholders in 2022. I recognize that that you guys are going to keep your options open. You're going to have to observe the conditions present, then when you make that decision. But can you share any kind of preferences or maybe even a framework since that's an idea that you guys have used on how you're going to approach that decision? And I'm kind of thinking along the lines of -- the books will tell you that share buybacks are more tax efficient. But share buybacks have a little bit of a bad reputation not just in the E&P business, but also in other industries as being pro cyclical. So how are you guys going to approach that question? And are there any preferences for how you do it? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean, that's a really good question, Charles and it's a highly debated topic internally on pro cyclical share buybacks. I think what's changed a little bit in the business is we're no longer growing as fast as we can and spending capital to grow and return cash to shareholders. I think generally now with capital being constrained to maintenance, you have a lot of flexibility above that. At the end of the day, we fundamentally have to look at what our NAV looks like on a mid-cycle oil price and mid-cycle commodity price environment. And if we're trading below that even with oil where it is then the buyback makes sense, because that return you know on a PV basis is a better return to buy in the stock market than buying the ground. So that's kind of the analysis that's going to go into it. Today it feels like a buyback is the right way to go. But again, it's still August 2nd and 3rd today and we have some time to make that decision. Travis Stice : Yes, Charles. I can't emphasize enough from the board's perspective. That decision is going to be made on what drives the greatest shareholder value. And yes, there's technical questions that need to be addressed. But at the end of the day our responsibility is to generate differential shareholder value. And that's still the problem statement that we'll solve with our shareholder return program. Charles Meade : That is helpful. Thank you for that. And then a follow-up. This -- you feel free to punt on this if you don't think it's productive. But Travis, you spent a fair amount of your preparing remarks talking about your ESG and specifically I was -- my attention was caught by your talk about this new tankless -- this tankless design. And I'm curious, when you look at the cost, the incremental cost of that, have you have you matched that up against the cost of -- perhaps, you guys talked in past quarters about buying carbon offset credits. Is that a comparison you guys make? And if you do how do they stack up? Travis Stice : Yes. It's part of the calculus, but it's not an either war, right? The fundamental decision to move into the carbon credits was a recognition that we're doing things operationally in the field that's going to get us to where we want to be over the next couple of years. But this is much more tactical. This is a specific strategy that we're deploying that has meaningful CO2 and flaring reductions associated with it. That's why we share the statistics of reducing emissions by 90% on our atmospheric tanks. We think it's really a good way to go. And we want to try to be as communicative as we can on this. Because this isn't a Diamondback secret nor is it something that we're trying to position Diamondback favorably for. This is an industry-wide issue and I think the solutions need to be industry-wide as well. And we want to be as collaboratively -- collaborative as we can be and share these learnings that we have. And this is a very good form to be able to share this technique. In fact some of these came probably from ideas that we got from other operators. So look, I'm very, very proud of the efforts and the results that Diamondback has generated particularly since we drew a line in the sand in 2019. And I'm also really proud about what our industry is doing as well. And the narrative has certainly moved away from us or maybe we didn't take advantage of it as an industry to control that narrative. But we've got to do a better job of saying we recognize what it is we're doing, has an environmental impact and more importantly that we are spending dollars in applying that same innovative thought processes that got us horizontal drilling and fracking and the success we've enjoyed by that. So we're really good problem solvers and we're going to communicate each quarter ways that we're solving this problem on our environmental responsibility objectives. Charles Meade : Great. Thanks for that all that commentary. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks Charles. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Travis Stice, CEO. Travis Stice : Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the contact information provided.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy Third Quarter 2021 Conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice CEO, Kaes Van't Hof CFO and Daniel Wesson EVP of Operations. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company's financial conditions, results of operations plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback 's Third Quarter Earnings Call. The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for Diamondback. We were able to generate a record amount of free cash flow as we continue to demonstrate why we are an operational leader in the Permian Basin. Although we're seeing pricing pressure in many areas of our business, particularly with consumables and labor, we've been able to offset these inflationary items through efficiency gains, both in design and execution. On the drilling side, we've decreased the number of days it takes to drill from spud to total depth by nearly 30% this year alone. And we're now drilling 2 mile laterals in roughly 10 days in the Midland Basin. On the completion side of the business. we've seen a step change in efficiency as we've transitioned the majority of our completion crews to simul -frac operations and are now completing wells in the Midland Basin, nearly 70% faster than when we were utilizing the traditional zipper frac design. These gains drove a significant beat on capital expenditures this quarter. And all the primary driver of our second consecutive decrease in capex for the year. The efficiencies gains this year will be permanent. And while inflation may impact services prices next year, Diamondback will be more insulated than our peers, given our control over the variable cost of well-designed, days to total depth on the drilling side, and lateral feet completed per day on the completion side of the business. As a result of these efficiency gains, as well as timing associated with some of our ancillary capital spend. We have lowered our 2021 capital guidance for a second time, and now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year, a decrease of 10% when compared to our initial capex guidance range we published in April. This includes approximately $435 to $475 million of estimated capital spend in the fourth quarter. Moving to 2022, we are committed to holding our Permian oil production flat next year. We expect to be able to maintain this level of production by spending similar capital on an annualized basis to our fourth quarter guidance. This soft guidance accounts for both the efficiencies we've gained this year, as well as the potential for service cost inflation in 2022, should activity levels increase in the Permian Basin and oil prices staged on. The reason we're committed to keeping oil volumes flat in 2022 is that we believe our capital discipline, coupled with our plan to return 50% of anticipated free cash flow to shareholders is the best near-term path to equity value creation. Diamondback is moving from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital, which will benefit long-term return on capital employed and to value creation. In order to initiate a moderate growth plan, we would need to see material changes to global oil and gas fundamentals, along with the shareholder support for such growth, and we do not see either of those things today. Until such time, we will continue to run our business for free cash flow generation, focusing internally, and ensuring we maintain our best-in-class cost structure in the face of inflationary pressure. This will position us for success regardless of where we are in the cycle. At current commodity prices, this plan translates to significant free cash flow generation next year. In our investor deck, we have a slide that shows illustrative 2022 free cash flow at various commodity prices. At today's strip, 2022 free cash flow is well worth of $3 billion. We plan to distribute 50% of this free cash flow using the combination of our sustainable and growing base dividend, share repurchases, and variable dividends. We would use repurchases and variable dividends interchangeably, depending on which presents the best return to our stockholders at that time. As a reminder, we plan to opportunistically repurchase shares of our common stock when we expect the return on that repurchase to be well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices. Which was clearly the case at mid-September when our board approved a $2 billion share repurchase program. After that announcement, we repurchased over 268,000 shares at an average share price of $82 for a total cost of $22 million in the third quarter. If we do not repurchase enough shares in the quarter to equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend.This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend, but importantly, at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned. We do not set our budget, drill wells, or underwrite acquisitions based on a strip oil pricing when current strip pricing is significantly above the last 5-year average. Therefore, we will underwrite repurchasing shares, which we see as an acquisition under the same assumptions. Our based dividend continues to be our primary method of returning capital to our shareholders. We have grown our base dividend at a quarterly compounded growth rate of roughly 10% since initiation in 2019. This quarter we raised our dividend by 11% to $0.50 a share for $2 a share on an annualized basis. Due to our low cost of supply, our dividend is currently protected down to $35 a barrel. As we have said before, increases to our base dividend would occur simultaneously with absolute debt reduction, and this year was a great example of that. Year-to-date, we have used our $1.65 billion of internally generated free cash flow, as well as proceeds from divestitures, to reduce our gross debt by $1.3 billion and increase our dividend 3 times. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen. And we expect to end 2021 at just over a turn of leverage. Yesterday, we fully redeemed our 650 million of senior notes due in 2023. As a result, we no longer have any callable debt. And our next material maturity is late 2024. Because of this, we are now in a position to accelerate our returns program to the fourth quarter of 2021. This is a direct result of the combination of everything I've mentioned today : 1. Strong operational performance, 2. A supportive macro backdrop, and 3. Increasing financial strength. Yet none of this would be possible without safe and efficient field operations. We continue to build on our safety track record and did not have a recordable employee safety incident this quarter. We have also decreased our flared volumes on our legacy properties and continued to work with third-parties to build out additional infrastructure to reduce flared volumes on our recently acquired assets. In addition, we expect to continue our reduced -- continue to reduce our flared volumes as we move into 2022 in conjunction with the completion of our Bakken divestiture. Yet, we're striving to be better and we recently announced our commitment and routine flaring by 2025, further reducing our emissions and moving us towards our commitment of reducing Scope 1 GHG intensity by at least 50%, and our methane intensity by at least 70% by 2024. The third quarter was a record quarter for Diamondback. We're proud to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in industry. And are thankful to operate in a pro-energy environment in the state of Texas. Our products, fuel, our local communities, our state, our country, and the world, we continue to innovate. Justifying our environmental license to operate in the communities where we and our families live, work, and play. We will continue to operate reliably and safely and are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the current macro environment by exercising capital discipline, keeping oil volumes flat, and generating significant returns to our shareholders. With these comments complete, Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q& A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Preliminary -- I can't hear you. Can you hear me now? Travis Stice : Yeah, got you now, Arun. Arun Jayaram : Sorry about that. Travis Stice, I wanted to get your preliminary thoughts on the 2022 outlook. In the deck, you highlighted an operating cash flow outlook of $4.8 billion at 70 and that $5.3+ billion at 80. You mentioned $3 billion to $3.5 billion of free cash flow under that range of oil price. This year, you're doing 270 gross sales. So my question is, what type of activity do you expect in 2022 that depends at $1.8 million budget? And I would be interested to know what kind of cash tax rate you're assuming in that free cash flow guide? Travis Stice : Yes. Thanks, Arun. Good questions. From an activity perspective, not a lot's going to change. Still going to be 75% or 80% of our wells turned in line in the Midland Basin still at this kind of 65 to 75 a quarter run rig. The only difference in '22 versus 2021 is that, remember we have -- we run a lot of rigs into the downturn in 2020 and decided to keep those rigs running to build docks. We drew down about 50 of those docks in 2021, and now are at a steady-state DUC levels. So we got a 50 DUC headwind in 2022 versus 2021, and then a little more infrastructure and midstream spend on the sale. in order to Robert reinitiate that we acquired from GEP and guide on as we get in before field development, there. cash taxes. If the world stays where it is today, oil-price wise, we will have some cash taxes in 2022, in the low 9-figures, hundred-ish to 200 million depending where we are, which is a good problem to have. Hopefully, the commodity prices stay where they are. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up. I wanted to see that case maybe for you if you could provide a little bit more detail around the drilling efficiency gains that you're seeing. I think you highlighted on Slide 11, 10 days now for 2 model lateral in the Midland Basin, then it also maybe describe where you're doing on the completion side and perhaps just the mix of [Indiscernible] frac in '22. Travis Stice : Yes, I'll start with tunnel frac. We picked up our first tunnel frac crews in the second half of 2020 and have been running those ever since. They've been extremely efficient, probably saves us about $25 or $30 a foot. But more importantly, in areas where you have offset production. You can get in, complete those wells, and get out and, therefore, limit your water out effect in large fields, which has been successful for us. So essentially, probably 90% of our wells next year, we'll be done with the tunnel frac crew. We've been running 3 tunnel frac crews this year, plus a fourth spot crew here and there. And I anticipate that can pace to be similar in 2022. And then on the drilling side has been pretty incredible putting the QEP drilling organization together with the Diamondback drilling organization and finding best practices. And this is the first -- and we kind of talked about this last quarter and the quarter before that, but now we've fully converted all of our Midland Basin rigs to the clear fluids drilling system that we're utilizing. And you can see average of ten days spud to TD has been a pretty large step change. And as Travis said in his comments, we all use the same fixed costs in our wells, but Kaes Van' t Hof : days to TD and amount of lateral fee completed per day are variable costs that we think we certainly differentiate ourselves with. So that's been the driver of CapEx reductions this year. And in an inflationary environment which we're seeing, given the oil prices and activity levels, that inflation is mitigated by controlling the variable costs which are our operations organization has been able to do. Travis Stice : And Arun, just to add to that point, when you look ahead in the future, it's always hard to see a step change in performance like we have seen this year, particularly on the drilling side. But just like I've said before, that Diamondback has been an operational leader and I expect us to maintain that position even going into the next several years. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Travis Stice : Thank you, Arun. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Travis you made the comment on the last call that you thought this was more of a seller's market than a buyer's market. Can you provide an update on your latest thoughts around M&A, and if you still feel that's the appropriate strategy and then prioritize and buying back your stock. Or returning capital makes sense relative to M&A. Travis Stice : The best way I can think about M&A right now is in share repurchases. I think to make some comments there about try and we don't underwrite M&A or share repurchases at these high commodity prices. And look, right now it's not something that I've been spending any of my time on M&A. I spend most of my time on seemed like regulatory policy related efforts and not the M&A. But, yeah, as you said the comment in the past, it's probably still true today that it's still feels based on these smaller deals rocking seller's market. But that's typically what you see with commodity prices like they've done this year. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Travis. And then just to continue to flush out the cost point. There's a lot of talk about service cost inflation as we move into ' 22. And potentially some tightness in the pressure pumping market. Can you talk about how you're managing some of those inflation risks and confidence interval around being able to execute on the capital budget that you start to pencil out here. Travis Stice : Yeah. I mean, what's -- the benefit we have. We've talked about the efficiency gains, but this year it's kind of been the year of raw materials going up on well costs, steel, diesel, sand, but it's logical that the service piece given labor tightness start to get a little traction. Now, it's really going to be dependent on where the rig count goes. We only added 8 rigs in the Permian in October. If we add a 100 rigs and it's going to be a lot tighter next year from here. But if we kind of find a steady-state then it's getting tougher for the service guys to push price. But either way, with the tunnel frac crews running with 3 crews running, we have no intention of dropping any of those, that kind of consistency for our business partners allows them to boost their margin profile and now that they have consistent work with Diamondback. Neil Mehta : Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Neil. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggett from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggett : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Guys, I wonder if I could ask, I guess it's kind of a housekeeping question on cost guidance. It looks to us that based on the guidance you've given for the fourth quarter, the Bakken or the [Indiscernible] looks like it had, on a number of levels, higher cash cost [Indiscernible], and so on. Would that be the right interpretation? In which case, could you give us some idea of how you expect maybe just qualitatively that run rate to look in 2022? Are we looking at a step down because the [Indiscernible] is now no longer part of the portfolio? Travis Stice : Good question, Doug, I mean, primarily LOE probably comes down a couple of times from where it's been the last couple of quarters with the Bakken contributing. So I think generally moving towards the low 4s and $4 a BOE and on the LOE side. We did keep the Bakken for a little longer than we liked but that kind of impacted the transition employees on the G&A side. So G&A probably comes down a nickel or so and then gathering transportation, certainly higher costs in the Bakken. So you probably see a step change down or step-down and GP&T closer to that kind of 125 to 150 range on a go-forward basis. So given an asset that we when we bought it, when we bought QEP, we've put up for sale right away. Unfortunately, the regulatory environment took a little longer to get it close, but generally, I think we're happy with the deal, is happy with the deal and our cost structure comes down a little bit in Q4 and into 2022. Doug Leggett : Okay. So I guess what I'm really getting at here is at least, it looks like a bit of an inflation offset on the operating cost side rather than on the capital side. I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting that correctly. So it sounds like I'm on the right track there. Travis Stice : Yes. Doug Leggett : Okay. Guys, I hate to be tough on the cash distribution policy as my second question, but I just want to get a little bit of clarification here. So let's assume that the current strip you're running at probably a $4 billion free cash number next year. So half of that goes back to shareholders and half of that goes to the balance sheet. That's pretty much what you are saying currently, right? Travis Stice : Yeah. At least half of that goes back to shareholders. Doug Leggett : Okay. So when you -- when we think about the rate -- the run rate, if you like for buybacks, the number could be pretty punchy and I just wanted to get a handle as to how you guys are thinking about that, because one on numbers you could be buying back a substantial amount of your stock. And I'm trying to think, do we run not $2 billion buyback over what period? That's really what I'm trying to get out because it sounds like it will get reloaded at some point. Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, I think the key value that's up the buyback is going to be opportunistic, not problematic. And as Charles said in his prepared remarks, you think about the buyback in terms of what is NAV at mid-cycle oil prices. Now we can have a long debate about where mid-cycle oil prices are going. But one quarter end, we're not willing to underwrite mid-cycle oil prices higher than we've seen in the last 5 years. I think the key is that the buybacks out there as a weapon for us at our disposal. But overall 50% of cash flows, free cash flow is getting returns. And if we don't get through the buyback in the quarter, there are lots of ups and downs in this industry. We don't get through the buyback in one particular quarter we're going to make our shareholders hold with a variable dividend, the quarter following. Doug Leggett : Well, this is a [Indiscernible] noise. $70-oil, it seems to actually got a long way to go before the stock is fairly valued. So I just wanted to understand how aggressive we should be on the buyback assumption, but I appreciate -- Travis Stice : Yeah. And that's a good problem to have. And considering where were this summer when we had low 70's oil and the stock was 30%, 40% below where it is. I think we're in a great position right now and I think there are opportunities on the buyback side. And we look forward to not being blacked out in a day or two and getting back after. Doug Leggett : I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you. Travis Stice : Yes, Doug, just to add to that, it's all good. It's hard to think back just 12 months ago when oil price was half of what it is today. And so we know that we're in a volatile industry and we think being cautious and also providing our shareholders the maximum flexibility is still the prudent way to run the business and I hope that the answers to the capital allocation question you just asked demonstrate that they were trying to be prudent in generating maximum shareholder returns. Doug Leggett : All right. Thanks Travis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning all. Congrats on your quarter end update. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Perhaps for you, Travis or Kaes, early 2022 indications from industry like yourself seemed to suggest the sectors broadly remaining capital discipline. In light of this discipline and the recovery in demand, the environment to us continues to look very constructive for the commodity, and the sectors valuations certainly remain attractive relative to the market. What are the 1 to 2 potential developments for the sector that gives you concern and could change the outlook to a less favorable one? Travis Stice : Well there is one thing that I think we have to watch very carefully and that's the discipline that the public Companies demonstrate in their earnings call now and again in February. Because it's really -- if a Company comes out there and starts growing, even though I've been very demonstrative that the world doesn't need that growth right now. But if a Company comes out of starts growing and gets recognized in the stock market for that growth, then that's going to change the calculus for our board and how we allocate capital towards growth. Again, I think if you look at the macro conditions, post-pandemic, we need 100 million barrels a day of demand reestablished. We're probably getting close there. More importantly, we need to see the surplus capacity, whatever that number is and the OpEx plus countries being absorbed in the world's energy equation. And then third lead, you need to see kind of the 5-year average of global inventories return. And it's unlikely you will see all 3 of those triangulate precisely, but I think you need to look at the price of oil when those indicators are all pointing at each other. And if the price of world is $70 or $80 a barrel, when those things are pointed each other, that probably means we're in good shape in terms of supply and demand. If on the other hand, oil price is significantly higher than those indicators pointing at each other. Then that's probably our first sign that the world is calling for more -- for more oil. But even having said that, our board is dedicated to making sure that we're allocating capital that's going to generate the greatest return to our stockholders. And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we've rapidly transitioned from a Company that consumes capital for growth to now one that is distributing capital. And we're looking at holding production flat and we're looking at growing per-share measures while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. And we think that's a prudent way to run our business. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And as my follow-up, perhaps digging into your operational efficiencies and really following up on Ellen's ( ph ) earlier question on Sanyal frac ops. Do you have a sense -- I'm sure you, but what percent of your wells today are seeing 2-well versus 4-wells Sanyal frac? And are the practical limitations that will limit 4-well implementation program line? Travis Stice : No. Almost a 100% of our Midland Basin pads or 4 wells or more. And the benefit of simul - frac, you've got to have an even number of wells, given that you're running 2, basically 2 careers at the same time. So less apparent in the Delaware. After Delaware, we're probably 50% 2 well or 4 well plus, and 80% 2 well plus, and the Midland, it's almost a 100% 4 well plus. Derrick Whitfield : Great update and thanks again for your time. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Adam Lawlis : Thanks, Derrick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Morning, Travis and Kaes. Thanks for your time this morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, David. David Deckelbaum : Just wanted to be a little bit more explicit around the well cost inflation. I just wanted to confirm, you all reached record points in the third quarter at $500 a foot in the Midland and 700 in the Delaware. Are you all modeling that now as sort of the trough period for costs? Is that already baked in at the higher level in the fourth quarter guide? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean, we had a really good quarter in the third quarter efficiency-wise. No major issues on drilling, completion went off without a hitch, not a lot of weather. So we certainly don't model for the best case scenario. But this is probably the base that we're going to build off of in terms of inflation going into '22. We went into 2021, got into 7% to 10% well cost inflation. Been able to go the other way. But like Travis said earlier in the call, we don't model in efficiency enhancements throughout the year in our budget. But certainly the organization on the upside is motivated to continue to push the limits. But this feels like a pretty solid quarter in terms of costs that will be tough to replicate in this kind of inflationary environment. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that and just for my follow-up,. Travis, perhaps for you or, in case, Kaes as well, but you referenced looking at per share metrics with the buyback. Before you talked about -- looking at using a buyback on your expected return exceed your cost of capital. Are you also looking at what your effective production growth per share looks like when you're considering buying back shares versus perhaps growing in the event that you see some of those early indicators coming back with the world calling for more oil? Travis Stice : Yeah, that's good. That's a good point, part of that part of the buyback work that we did when we announced it was, we looked at how much capital does it take to grow the business 5% a year for the next 5 years or grow the business 10% a year for the next 5 years versus shrink the business by 5 or 10% a year in terms of share count over the next 5 years. And the law of large numbers kept us up to on the growth side, but on the buyback side of the shrink side, it started to get easier to grow per-share metrics year 2 and 3. And obviously it's stock price dependent, but that was along the work that we did. We do our shareholders own more reserves per share, production per share, a longer inventory life per share. With the buyback versus trying to just follow into the ground and oversupply market that's already pretty fragile. David Deckelbaum : Got it. Thank you, guys. Travis Stice : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Thanks. Good morning. If I can return back to these shareholder return plan. And I think you all said, you're going to at least give 50% back to investors, and could you just give some color around that? Does that mean, if they're not debt take-out opportunities, you'd potentially look at say, increasing the buyback or dividend above, sort of that 50% threshold. And also on, if you can give some color on the fixed dividend. Where could that go? You all get to a point where it just doesn't feel comfortable because of the sustainability at more of a mid-cycle price. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Scott, conversations with large shareholders have basically said, we want to make sure there's dividends well-protected below 40. Our dividend breakeven for '22 is in the $35-oil range. And we're buying puts at $50-oil. So I think we're still very well protected. I think the dividend is going to continue to grow. The Board talked about it every quarter. We've hit this 10% CAGR since introduction in 2018. That's probably a lofty goal to continue for multiple years, but certainly something we're talking about continuing the dividend growth on a steady basis aggressively. And I think as long as that breakeven stays in the mid to high 30s, we feel pretty good about it. Scott Hanold : Okay. And could you comment on the view on taken out debt? And if you would, focus a little bit more on variable dividends or buybacks, if there's not that take down. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, that's right. Sorry about that. We still want to take down gross debt. We have a maturity in 2024. We also want to keep a larger cash balance and we've run in the past just for inflation. But yeah, we're kind of saying, hey, listen at least 50% of the free cash flow has got to go back to the shareholders. And if we don't have anything else to do with it, and I think it's logical that more will go back, so I would like to have cash to take up the 24s and be in a position to not have any material maturities until 2029. But like we've gone over the last 5 or 6 quarters, that's not mutually exclusive from our shareholders getting more money back. Scott Hanold : Okay. And then as you look into 2022, how do you think? And I know you all are talking about flat oil production into next year. If you were to just outperform operationally, would you guys I guess, reduce your well completions, say in the back half for the year to maintain flat production, or should we assume that you'll have that 65-70 well program next year? And if there's operational performance, maybe you do a little bit better than maintain a flat production. Travis Stice : Well, I think generally right, got outperformed guidance on oil production, which we've done this year. But what we've said all year is that, if we are doing better than we thought, we're going to cut capital. And that's what we've done in 2021. And I think that's essentially the goal for 2022, even in the face of some inflationary pressures. Scott Hanold : Got it. Appreciate it. Travis Stice : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotia Bank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Sorry, but I want to go back into the cash return. I think it make a lot sense with the volatility in the market that you put 50% of the excess cash go into the balance sheet. But is there a number at some point on your net debt will be at a point that you may be able to raise the cash returns from 50% to 75% or higher? Is that some number that you might, that you guys are thinking, or that's not really is just that you will go with and saying that, okay, if I don't have any additional use because that I no longer have any debt to you right away then I would just increasing that percentage? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, Paul. That's a great question. I think what we're focused on is committing to the -- at least 50% right now, as this industry evolves and you see companies make these types of commitments. You don't want to walk them back, right? So there will be quarters where we distribute more cash than 50%, but also, I don't want that to become a baseline for the next couple of decades. I think we're focused on 50% right now and some quarters will do better and some quarters will hit it that at 50%, but the 50s are for guarantee. Paul Cheng : Okay. And the second question just relates to your midstream operation letter with the dividend yield over 8%, much higher than the spend the fang is sell. One will argue that your cost of capital is actually very high over there. And doesn't seems to me that really have good reason to have that as an independent trade. We have seen a lot of consolidation in the midstream business. One of your peers that their midstream asset just recently announced to merge with a private Company. And that's where you're going to reduce their ownership so that they can deconsolidate. So just curious then, how you're looking at that business and whether that you may want to do some alternative initiative we need to the structure on that. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah. Good question. And we've seen a couple routes. We've seen some parent Companies buy in their subsidiaries and some sell down. You know, I think for us, it's more strategic just to keep it -- to keep that cost structure. And we can address it more on the [Indiscernible] call. But I think if you look under the hood, we've been really trying to highlight the Rattler story. We signed a new [Indiscernible] earlier this year or this month, that's going to be highly successful for us, with a lot of Diamondback exposure. We've got the Rattler assets dropped down about in another month. So certainly the strategy as a subsidiary hasn't changed and the importance of it to us hasn't changed. I certainly don't think we'd go down the cell route. But we look at costs capital, we look at multiples, and we've got -- if the stock is not working, we've got to think about what to do. But right now, it seems like it's -- Rattlers had a good year. It doesn't have the commodity exposure that Diamondback and Viper, perhaps it's probably under performed a little bit, but it's still generating a lot of free cash to Unit holders of which Diamondback's the largest. Paul Cheng : Yeah, the only thing I would say is that, Diamondback have a good story and is probably one of the most attractive NPS names out there. And I think we will help that to even further simplified the CapEx structure so that when the investor looking at you, they you don't have to look at so many different CapEx structures. Just my utmost feeling. Thank you. Travis Stice : Yeah we heard that before Paul and we've recognized it. Fortunately, the mother ship has gotten very large and so there's less leakage to the subsidiaries, but both have been important to us over the last -- for the last half decade. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hey, guys. Just wanted to touch base a bit on third quarter production. It looks like it kind of outperformed here and just wanted to get a little bit of color behind that in terms of being a little bit ahead of the guidance was just pretty much just better well performance. You did mention kind of a pretty claim operational quarter with no weather issues. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : We had a good quarter. We're very focused on hitting our numbers and the benefit of slowing down and not trying to grow as fast as possible is that the operations organization has gotten better. You can see it on the well cost side. It's also happening on the production side. So good quarter all around. I think we feel really confident in the forward outlook and continuing to hit our numbers here. Leo Mariani : Okay. Then, just in terms of '22 capex, I understand it's a loose guide that you folks targeted here. If I take the fourth-quarter capex range and annualize it, gives me 1.74 billion to 1.9. So pretty wide there at the end of the day. Just wanted to get a sense, what you guys think perhaps the outcome could be on the inflation side there. And I know it's still moving target here and we weren't on 100% know how this plays out. But any early indications of what the inflation can be and is that what would target the top end of the 1.9? Just trying to get a sense of what it was baked in there. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think I've said this, 2022 is not going to be long on November second of 2021. We are one of the few companies talking about 2022, we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks, but probably have about 10% inflation built into there with a little bit more infrastructure and midstream spend, that we didn't need to go through this year. But generally, I think we can narrow that guidance as we get into 2022 and have more evidence. I think the comment earlier, if the rig count goes up a 100 rigs from here, it's a different story. Than if the rig count keeps creeping up 5 to 10 rigs a month. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks, guys. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Leo. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade from Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis and Kaes. Travis Stice : Hey, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, I want to thank you for your prepared comments, you really addressed a lot of the natural questions, on why you've adopted the stance you have for ' 22. But just one question for me, is around the buyback. When we look at the -- you guys announced it on the 15th, and if we look at the average price you bought back in the and the chart of your share price, it looks like you guys got after it for a few days and then wrapped it up probably in about a week. And I'm curious, is the right inference to make is that low 80s is where you guys -- where the scale tips to buybacks as far as the preferred way to return, I guess increase returns to shareholders or alternatively is it that -- Kaes, you mentioned a blackout earlier and obviously that makes sense. That -- is that a function of your legal team putting you a blackout a few days before the end of the quarter? Travis Stice : Yeah. I think is just purely we get blacked out. We get blacked out 10 days before the quarter ends and were blacked out until a couple of days after earnings. So we'll assess where we are in a couple of days and be back after it. Charles Meade : That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Harry Mateer from Barkley. Your line is now open. Harry Mateer : Hi. Good morning, guys. I want to dig in maybe a little bit more on the debt piece of it you guys talked around it. But as you noted, nothing callable at this point given what you've taken out so far this year, next maturity in 2024. First question is, how do you navigate that? Because -- are you thinking about tenders, make holes that gets expensive, but then at the same time sitting with a bunch of cash in the balance sheet, waiting for the maturity at the end of '24 might not be viewed as attractive either. So, how are you thinking about approaching that in the next couple of years? Travis Stice : I think we're just going to keep following the prices of the bonds and try to get below may call as we can. If not, the may call is not too restrictive on something like our '24s as you get in the late ' 22, but certainly not looking to take out anything past 2029. Harry Mateer : Got it. Okay. And then on the cash balance, what -- you mentioned one to run with more of a buffer than you had in the past. What is that number for you? Travis Stice : I like 500 as a minimum, we kind of said that over the last couple of quarters. And I think that's a good starting point for us. Harry Mateer : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks Harry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Sankey Research. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey : Guys, this reporting the Wall Street Journal this morning that the FDA is going to massively increase methane emission limits. Can you just talk a little bit about what that means for you and for the industry? And then I had a question from a major investor who asked me to -- I heard from Diamondback that multiyear flat volumes are now embraced by you and not just for 2022, is that what I'm hearing? Thanks. Travis Stice : Yes. The methane rules. I think we still have to see how the final document is written down if that continues as I've stated in my prepared remarks to focus on methane intensity. We're going to reduce that by 70% from 2019 levels by 2024. So depends on where the threshold is, but I've been very pleased with the progress we've made already on reducing methane intensity. And in fact, we've got 20+ million dollars allocated next year to continue those efforts to reduce methane intensity. And if we do things right, hopefully we will be below the threshold, by which the methane intensity applies. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And then for our multi-year plans, we've always issued multi-year plans at Diamondback. We didn't buy into a multiyear growth plan in 2016 and we're not going to commit to multiple years at flat today. Now, certainly 2022 and 2021 will both be relatively flat production. We think it's worked and capital discipline has worked for this industry. I think this industry has tried a market share war with OpEx before and it didn't work out. So why don't we let OpEx bring back their spare capacity and all stay flat, and we will see what the future holds in 2023 and beyond. But right now we're committed to 2022 flat capital discipline as rollover Diamondback. And as Travis mentioned, we're going to become a net return of capital rather than consumer of capital. Travis Stice : And look OpEx is going to do what OpEx is going to do. I've said we've transitioned in it that Virbac transition very rapidly from consuming capital, returning capital. And focused on the increase or the growth that we're seeing in per-share metrics. And I've outlined as the macro elements by which the world will be calling on more growth. And I think every quarter that we go through, Diamondback, it's board is demonstrating our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. And we're doing that right now about generating all this free cash flow this way. But free cash flow is coming to us and our commitment to return at least 50% of that back to the shareholders. Paul Sankey : Understood, guys. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks, Paul. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to CEO, Travis Stice. You may proceed. Travis Stice : Thank you again to everyone for participating in today's call. If you got any questions, please contact us using the information provided.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Earlis. Good morning and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company\u2019s financial conditions, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. 2021 was a great year for Diamondback and our industry with higher product prices allowing the vast majority of our industry to one repair and improve balance sheets quickly; two, accelerate returns to shareholders; and three, make significant progress on environmental objectives. At Diamondback, we reduced our absolute debt by $1.3 billion, increased our base dividend every quarter, initiated a return of capital framework and announced ambitious environmental goals designed to help us earn our environmental license to operate. In the fourth quarter alone, buoyed by commodity price strength, Diamondback generated $772 million of free cash flow with production and capital both positively exceeding expectations. We returned 67% of this free cash flow to stockholders, which was above our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders quarterly. This return was made up of $106 million allocated to our growing base dividend, now at $2.40 a share on an annualized basis, which represents a current yield of approximately 2% and $409 million in share purchases as we bought back nearly 3.9 million shares at an average price of just under $106 per share. We are at the beginning of an incredible period of value creation for the industry. And I\u2019m confident that the capital discipline demonstrated by us and our peers in 2021 will continue putting returns and therefore shareholders first. We believe this is the best near-term path to equity value creation as our shift from a consumer of capital to a net distributor of capital cements itself as our long-term business model. Two months into 2022, economies are rapidly reopening around the world stoking demand, which we believe to be close to if not above pre-pandemic levels. On the supply side, we are witnessing some underperformance from OPEC+ to meet this increasing demand, calling into question spare capacity with global inventory numbers now approaching 2010 to 2014 levels. We cited both global oil inventories and OPEC spare capacity as impediments to any discussion around U.S. public company oil growth, and those issues appear to have subsided for now. However, the global balance remains tenuous at best with up to a million barrels per day of additional Iranian barrels potentially coming online sometime this year and U.S. growth expectations continuing to climb higher led by private companies and more importantly or more recently measures. Both of these supply factors could be bearish signals for oil, therefore Diamondback\u2019s team and board believe that we have no reason to put growth before returns. Our shareholders, the owners of our company agreed. And as a result, we will continue to be disciplined, keeping our oil production flat this year. As such our plan for this year is simple. Maintain oil reduction of approximately 220,000 barrels per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to nearly $4 billion of free cash flow, which to our returns framework gives a minimum of $2 billion of cash back to our investors. At the same time, we are committed to permanent returns to our investors, which is why we continue to lean into our base dividend, increasing it again by 20% this quarter. Our growing base dividend is our primary means of returning capital and we\u2019ve increased it by quarterly CAGR of over 10%, since it was initiated in 2018. Today, we have line of sight to get our dividend to $3 a share by the end of this year, if market conditions remain favorable, which would mean 25% of our 2022 distributable free cash flow would be allocated through this constant predictable form of shareholder return. History has taught us that oil is a volatile commodity and that the macro environment will not always be this favorable. So we continue to work towards protecting our base dividend down to $35 WTI with a view that this dividend is really just a form of debt and if plus our maintenance capital budget have to be protected to the extreme downside. By continuing to focus on our fortress balance sheet and layering on our strategic derivative positions to our hedge book, we are confident in our ability to perform in any environment. While the base dividend is the primary tool of returning capital, we will also utilize share repurchases and potentially variable dividends to reach at least 50% of distributed free cash flow on a quarterly basis. We continue to repurchase shares opportunistically, taking advantage of volatility while generating returns on these repurchases well in excess of our cost of capital at mid-cycle commodity prices, which today is assumed to be around $60 WTI. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve spent $430 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. If the free cash flow returned through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of free cash flow for that particular quarter, then we will make our investors hold by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. However, it is important that the Board also retains discretion on what to do with the other 50% of the free cash flow generated. As was the case in the fourth quarter, we have the ability to distribute above and beyond our 50% threshold if we feel comfortable with our balance sheet and associated cash balance and do not have a use for excess cash, we will return that cash aggressively to shareholders. Some quarters, we will distribute 50% of free cash flow, but in others we will have the ability to return more, just like we did in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we fully expect to differentiate ourselves not only by our returns framework but more importantly through our consistent execution in the field. Last year, our clear fluid design lowered our average drilling days in the Midland Basin by approximately 35%. That\u2019s an astounding achievement for our drilling department. On the frac side, our simul-frac operations continue to reduce our time on pad as we are now averaging 3,200 feet per day with our four-well simul-frac design. As we\u2019ve laid out in our investor deck, these operational efficiencies have helped us mitigate the substantial cost pressures we\u2019ve seen related to consumables and labor and as we noted last quarter, these gains will be permanent, giving us more variable cost control than our peers due to these industry-leading drilling and completion times. Now when you bake in these cost increases and offset them with our efficiency gain, this equates to about 10% of additional capital spend year-over-year, which is baked into our guidance. We will try to offset this inflation by doing what we do best, innovating, implementing new technology and drilling more efficient and better wells. As mentioned, we were able to offset a vast majority of pricing increases we faced last year through this type of innovation. And we\u2019re confident we can maintain our best-in-class capital efficiency and cost structure this year. At the same time, we are fortunate to have multiple pieces of our capital cost structure locked in with contracts and dedications like our water and sand supply. As the rig count in the Permian climbs, we will continue to work to control other components of our cost structure, particularly services, labor and consumable products while continuing to be the leader in cash margin and capital efficiency. Finally, I\u2019d like to close by detailing the strides we\u2019ve made in our environmental, social and governance practices. To begin, we met four of our five environmental goals in 2021, which had a 20% weighting in management\u2019s short-term compensation this year and included specific targets related to flaring, water recycling, GHG emission intensity, produced liquid spills and total recordable incidents. Unfortunately, we did not meet our expectation of flaring less than 1% of gross gas produced. While we met this goal on legacy Diamondback acreage, which was how the goal was set, we missed our target when incorporating our acquired QEP assets, which included the QEP Bakken asset we divested in October. We will continue to improve our takeaway on the acquired Permian acreage and partner with our midstream companies to not only structure contracts then incentivize takeaway in price-agnostic environments, but also apply performance-based incentives and penalties related to flaring. All of our progress in 2021 positions us well to hit our long-term goals of reducing our GHG and methane intensity by 50% and 70%, respectively, by 2024, and recycling over 65% of our water and eliminating all routine flaring by 2025. These environmental goals hit close to home as we hold the unique title of being the only publicly traded E&P headquartered in Midland, in the heart of the Permian Basin. As such, we feel an enormous social responsibility to better the community in which we live, work and play. We recently committed $2.5 million to a complete redesign of Midland\u2019s largest public park as well as $500,000 for Midlands Meals on Wheels program. Arguably more important, however, our employees continue to give their time to sponsor and host camps, reading and instructional programs and public work projects. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our team\u2019s efforts. 2021 is a great year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed over 30% of it to shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet by substantially reducing our absolute debt load and continued to produce one of the cleanest and most cost-effective barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, we are confident in continued consistent operational execution and the ability to generate peer-leading returns. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, Travis and team. I wanted to just get some broader thoughts on your plan, Travis, to allocate free cash flow in 2022, obviously, have buybacks, variable dividends and debt, while I\u2019m assuming you want to keep some powder dry for A&D opportunities. But with the stock trading above the valuation of the stock, assuming a mid-cycle deck, we think you\u2019re probably going to pivot a little bit more to variable dividends, but I wanted to get your thoughts on that and how the $4 billion, if the strip holds could be allocated this year? Travis Stice : Sure. Arun, it\u2019s good visiting with you again. Listen, I\u2019ll tell you to the penny how much on share repurchases we bought in May, if any. But what hasn\u2019t changed, Arun, is our commitment. Whatever portion of our free cash flow that we don\u2019t spend on repurchases, we\u2019re going to return that free cash flow to our shareholders. Look, when it comes to share repurchasing, we view that as just like any other investment decision, drill a well, M&A activity. We do so, like you mentioned, at a mid-cycle oil price, which for us is around $60 a barrel. And it has to generate a positive return. And when you go back and look at what oil price has averaged since the fall of 2014 has averaged $53 a barrel. And if you can guarantee me that the price of oil is going to be $90 or above, then I\u2019ll tell you that our shares are undervalued. But we\u2019re going to be disciplined. We\u2019re going to be opportunistic when it comes to our share repurchase programs just like any other form of capital allocation and what we don\u2019t repurchase in shares we\u2019re going to return back to our shareholders in the variable dividend every quarter. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I think on top of that, Arun, we certainly want a fortress balance sheet. I think there\u2019s some stuff for us to do with our 2024 and 2025 notes this year, pay down debt when things are good. And I think that could open the door for higher returns. I think the key is 50% of free cash flow is going back to the shareholders. And if we don\u2019t have anything to do with the other 50%, it\u2019s coming back as well and we proved that in the fourth quarter. Arun Jayaram : Great. And I had one follow-up on the Permian in general. Just thinking about the industry, what are the potential headwinds for future growth will be gas takeaway, current scrapes are just around 14 Bcf a day. We estimate there is about 17 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. So I wanted to get your thoughts, Travis, your net production is approaching 0.5 B and how do you think Diamondback is positioned to manage this tightness that could occur in late 2023 or early 2024? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean I think, Arun, unlike the past, I think we have the size and scale now to contribute to pipelines and make sure it happens. We\u2019re certainly doing our part, not growing. I wish other people would grow less in the Permian too but that\u2019s a different topic. But generally, we committed to the Whistler pipeline, just announced that this -- with this earnings. And that was with our WTG commitment on gas gathering and processing, committed to the BANGL pipeline, which is NGL takeaway. And really just trying to put our balance sheet to work to make sure pipeline capacity is strong coming out of the basin. I think we\u2019ll see some announcements here pretty soon. Saw a couple of things last week on new pipes, but I think generally the industry is aligned that we can\u2019t go back to the way we were when it comes to flaring. And particularly with gas prices up, we should all be incentivized to make sure gas flows out of the Permian. So it\u2019s going to be tight if growth continues through 2023, but I\u2019m pretty optimistic on 2024. Arun Jayaram : Okay. So are you looking to add capacity on those two pipes, one of the two pipes? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, we would. You have to have taken kind rights to be able to do that. And so we\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on our midstream partners to either relinquish our taking kind rights to us so that we can contribute to the pipeline like we did on the Whistler pipe, putting our balance sheet to work or incentivizing them to contribute themselves. So -- that\u2019s a little bit of a game of chicken with our G&P\u2019s. But I think message is we both need to figure this out as a group and we would be willing to put our balance sheet to work to make it happen. Arun Jayaram : Great thanks a lot. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thank you, Arun. Travis Stice : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Your next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team and congratulations to everyone on the new promotions over at Diamondback. The first question is the hedging strategy. Travis, you talked about a long-term $60 WTI view, curve\u2019s obviously trading well through that. Does it make sense to opportunistically layer in hedging and thereby lock in more of the capital returns? Or do you think, given the strength of balance sheet, you can run the business more open? Travis Stice : As our balance sheet strengthens, I think your comment about running the business a little bit more open makes sense. But having said that, though, we have to make sure that we protect the extreme downside. Look, the impossible happened in 2020. While we don\u2019t ever think that\u2019s going to happen again, we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got insurance to provide accordingly. I think we try to do deferred premium puts as our preferred hedging strategy, which kind of sets that protection in place for us while accomplishing, giving our shareholders all the upside on price as well. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean we hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And preparing for the worst is buying puts at $50. The balance sheet doesn\u2019t blow out, dividend is well protected, still our free cash flow above that and try to leave as much upside for the best as possible. Neil Mehta : Yes. That makes sense. The follow-up is Travis, you famously said, I think it was last August that your view was it was a seller\u2019s market. And stock has obviously done very well since then and your equity value has strengthened. What\u2019s your thought on the M&A environment in the Permian? Do you view Diamondback as a logical consolidator. And how do you think about the time line of that, especially with oil above mid-cycle prices? Travis Stice : Yes, Neil, that\u2019s a good question. And it\u2019s really hard for me to see how kind of the excess of G&A that still exists in the Permian, how all of that gets consolidated. I wish I could articulate clearly what the catalyst is going to be that allows consolidation to occur, because it\u2019s needed in our industry. That being said, there\u2019s a lot of companies that had one foot in the -- whistling through the graveyard with one foot in the grave. And now a couple of years later, oil is at $90 a barrel and they\u2019re expecting to sell out and get value on future cash flows at $90 a barrel. And as I mentioned, it\u2019s the same strategy on our share buybacks, right? If the mid-cycle oil price is $60 a barrel, then it\u2019s going to be hard to close the spread between bid and ask on the much-needed M&A activity that has to occur here in the Permian. So, while I\u2019d like to think Diamondback could create unreasonable value for our shareholders, like we did with the QEP and Guidon acquisition. It\u2019s hard with these frothy expectations on the oil price that we\u2019re seeing today. Neil Mehta : No, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you, Travis, Kaes. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Your next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Good morning guys, thanks for the time. My question maybe for you, Kaes, is my first, a little different angle on shareholder return. What I\u2019d say there is -- while I\u2019m glad to see you all have really not gotten caught in this group think of suggestion you have to pay out all your free cash flow. The question I\u2019m getting from the investors is, how do you all think you got to show investors that you\u2019ll continue to be the best allocators of capital that you have. And Kaes you mentioned anything is out there on a lot of possibilities with one of those allocation choices at some point include higher production. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Neil, good question. I think the Street has lost sight of value creation for E&Ps. I get that there\u2019s a lot of cash going back to shareholders. But at the end of the day, if you can generate more free cash flow with the same expectations out of the business, you\u2019re creating more value over a long period of time. Execution is going to matter, metrics matter, controlling cost matters, PDP F&D matters. And for us, all of those inputs create more free cash flow, and that means more free cash flow is going to shareholders, whether it\u2019s 50% of free cash flow in one quarter or 67% and another. We kind of think about this as a partnership. It\u2019s just that the partnership has a commitment to return 50% of free cash flow if we have something to do with the other 50% that creates unreasonable value, we\u2019ll keep it. But we\u2019re not going to sit on cash and we\u2019re going to distribute a ton of cash to partners. Just the only commitment is at least 50% of that cash is coming back. Neal Dingmann : Great to hear. And then Travis, my second question, probably for you is, I like the Slides 10 and 11 on margins and costs. I\u2019m just wondering specifically, can you give maybe a little more color on the primary driver of that leading cash margin. I mean is it that sort of newish 10-day drilling well design that\u2019s driving that? Or maybe just talk about what you would primarily point to. Travis Stice : Yes, certainly, we\u2019ve got the benefit of the improvements that we made in 2021, as I mentioned, 35% improvement in drill times, and we\u2019re going to get a full year impact of that this year, which is helping us offset the inflationary effects. A couple of data points, Neal, that -- we just -- I just find out about yesterday as we\u2019re getting updated in our weekly meeting, we drilled a well in the Delaware Basin. It\u2019s a 15,000-foot lateral. We drilled it to TD in nine days, which was a record for us and for that area, just an outstanding occurrence. And even on the Midland Basin side, we\u2019ve been drilling the most. We drilled another three-mile lateral, a 15,000-foot lateral in seven and a half days. But what\u2019s amazing about that, and that\u2019s to TD. What\u2019s amazing about that is we don\u2019t spend three and a half days in the lateral. Now we used a rotary steerable and sometimes rotary steerable technology is a little harder to replicate. But that\u2019s what\u2019s possible. So, we\u2019ve got an organization Neal that continues to lean into this variable expense side. And what I can emphasize enough is that that\u2019s ground that\u2019s taken and never given back. When you become more efficient at something that\u2019s always on your side of the table, and it\u2019s for the good guys. So, I know kind of -- that\u2019s a little bit off topic there, but it\u2019s really important to hear that our organization is locked and loaded, and this machine is humming very, very efficiently. And you couldn\u2019t want more -- you couldn\u2019t want a machine humming more efficiently than we are right now in an inflationary environment. Neal Dingmann : No, I always want to hear those updates. Thanks Travis, thanks, Kaes. Travis Stice : Thanks, Neal. Operator : Your next question is from Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning all. Congrats on your quarter and update. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thank you, Derrick. Travis Stice : Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : With my first question, I wanted to focus on the flaring you experienced in Q4. With the full understanding of its importance to you based on your ESG mandate and incentive compensation. Could you speak to the higher-than-expected flaring you experienced? And what steps you guys can take to mitigate that in the future even with your partners? Travis Stice : Yes. If you look on Slide 18, Derrick, we laid it out with quite a bit of detail. And just as an aside, you\u2019ve heard me say this before, our Board expects management to not only lead the industry in environmental measures, but also lead the industry in disclosure. And I think 18 is a pretty good slide. But let me just point to something specifically. If you look in the top right of that slide, it talks about flaring by source. And if you take third-party planned maintenance and third-party unplanned maintenance, that\u2019s 80% of our flaring volumes in 2021. And particularly on the unplanned side, which is something that we\u2019ve just got to do a better job with our business partners on. Now, I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve actually changed contracts where we can that both incentivizes and penalizes flaring performance. So, we\u2019re looking to expand that concept across all of our gatherers, but we\u2019re also intentionally asking our midstream gatherers to help us as an industry on this effort. And that\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019re calling attention to this to their performance on Slide 18. Now, particular to the miss, I tried to lay that out, we set the goal for our flaring before we bought QEP and Guidon. And we didn\u2019t adjust our goal just because we acquired assets that had much worse flaring statistics than we did. We tried to absorb it. We did absorb it, but it cost us on our annual performance. But that\u2019s -- we felt like that was the right way to treat it. Once the goal is set, we honor it. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. One thing to add is, we also deferred half a million barrels of oil last year. I mean we\u2019re trying to do our part here, Derrick. We deferred 850,000 BOEs, half a million barrels of oil because of flaring. We\u2019re just kind of asking that both sides, midstream and upstream get together to solve this industry issue. Travis Stice : And that shouldn\u2019t be lost, Derrick. That\u2019s a very key point. Think about that. We deferred over a half a million barrels last year just to avoid flaring. And that\u2019s a behavior that represents a substantial pivot for Diamondback and a substantial pivot if our peers follow suit for our industry. And what I believe you\u2019re seeing, Derrick, is you\u2019re seeing environmental stewardship more of -- more companies are viewing it as an operating philosophy as opposed to an expense, which it was historically or hit the volumes. And I think that\u2019s an important narrative for our industry to get out there and push as an operating philosophy, environmental stewardship, particularly around eliminating flaring and eliminating methane emissions is simply the way to operate a business on a full cycle basis. And I hope that makes sense. Derrick Whitfield : It does. And your commitment to it, it\u2019s quite clear. As my follow-up, I wanted to dig in a bit more on the macro side and ask if you could share your expectations for growth in the Permian in 2022 and ask if the growth rates outlined by the majors in the Permian if that\u2019s a concern for you? Travis Stice : Well, look, I pointed out that on a global sense, the supply-demand is pretty tenuous. And even with the announced growth from the majors, I\u2019m not sure that the total barrels that they\u2019re producing are growing into the global equation. So that\u2019s kind of a plus. Now, right here to look out my window, I know that the Permian is running about 300 rigs right now. We\u2019re probably on the way to 350 rigs or 400 rigs by the end of this year. And a large portion of that -- of those rigs have been operated by Permian. But I think some of the growth you\u2019re seeing on a go-forward basis will be from the majors. We\u2019ve already talked about gas pipeline takeaway issues and a little bit on the NGLs, which I think Diamondback has been on our front foot, getting some strategic alliances there, and oil take away is in great shape, but it is going to create inflationary pressures. But that\u2019s what you\u2019re charged to us and all of our industry\u2019s charge is how to manage CapEx in an inflationary environment and not put your shareholder return program at risk. That\u2019s kind of how I think about the total Permian playbook. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And you guys have done a great job with that. So thanks again for your time. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Operator : Your next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Guys, post the deals, I guess, the cleanup of last year, it looks like you\u2019ve gone through a little bit of an inventory high grading on your latest disclosure. I just wonder if you could kind of walk us through what that looked like. It looks to us that you\u2019re sitting on about a better than 15-year inventory if you define just the core of that slightly longer lateral inventory you laid out today. So, can you just walk us through what that process was, and if I\u2019m thinking about it the right way? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean, generally, Doug, post the deals we do a lot of trades to try to block up, extend inventory, extend laterals, sometimes at the expense of lower working interest inventory that may not be operated or have shorter laterals. So that\u2019s the blocking and tackling piece that we\u2019re very focused on. And second, on inventory, we\u2019ve gone a little wider in both the Midland and the Delaware Basins. I think our updated inventory numbers reflect that in kind of moving towards six wells to seven wells per zone per section in the Midland Basin versus kind of eight being the tightest 660-foot spacing. And the Delaware move into kind of four wells to five wells a section in the primary zones versus six wells. I think what we found is we\u2019re not sacrificing a ton of EUR from that unit by going a little wider, but we are generating much better returns and much better capital efficiency. So, I think the offset from a present value perspective outweighs the loss of a couple of locations. Doug Leggate : So is it the right way to think about this on if you guys maintain your ex growth outlook, we\u2019re looking at better than 15 years of drilling. I mean, obviously, I know it\u2019s a little bit too precise. But I\u2019m trying to just think about the longevity of the portfolio strategy with the inventory you have today. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, that\u2019s fair. I will add that -- it\u2019s a small number, but we are completing five less wells at the midpoint in 2022 than we were in 2021. And as the base decline shallows out and we get active on sale of Robertson Ranch, where we have a significant percentage of minerals helping us out, that capital efficiency is going to look a little better here over the coming years. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up, I hate to do it, but it\u2019s the variable dividend buyback, balance sheet question. When you pay out a variable, the cash is gone at the top of the cycle, let\u2019s say, M&A opportunities fall by the wayside, let\u2019s assume then you get a correction in oil prices and the cash has been paid out as a variable. I\u2019m just kind of curious, your commentary, you mentioned variable has differentiated you, that you haven\u2019t gone down that path. What should we take from those comments as to how you\u2019re prioritizing setting cash on the balance sheet, continuing to buy back stock if you see intrinsic value or indeed giving out a variable dividend that you don\u2019t really get a chance to get back? Travis Stice : Yes. So it\u2019s really pretty straightforward, Doug. It\u2019s lean into the base dividend, which we\u2019ve shown every quarter since we initiated the dividend back in 2018. And we\u2019re going to get that up to $3 a share if the market conditions don\u2019t change. The second is share repurchases. But again, there\u2019s a calculus that\u2019s involved in an investment decision for share repurchases. So to the extent we can consume 50% of our free cash flow at a good return on share repurchases then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. But if we see a dislocation between commodity price, share repurchases, we\u2019ll pivot quickly within the quarter to pay out the remaining, up to 50% -- or at least 50% of the free cash flow in the form of a variable dividend. So in some quarters, it\u2019s at least going to be 50%. And in some quarters, it could be as much as like we did this last quarter, 67% or more. But we\u2019re just trying to maintain at the end of the day, Doug, we\u2019re trying to maintain the greatest flexibility to generate the best shareholder return. Doug Leggate : Travis, I apologize. What do you do with the other 50%? You did 67% in the fourth quarter? Travis Stice : Well, right now, we\u2019d like to continue to work on having a fortress balance sheet and having cash on that fortress balance sheet for an inevitable down cycle. So, I think we\u2019re focused on kind of our mid-decade maturities if we can extend some of them, but also pay down most of them. That clears the way for a lot more cash to be put on the balance sheet and then step up the overall shareholder return from there. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something we\u2019re there yet, Doug. Doug Leggate : Thanks, Travis. Travis Stice : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Your next question is from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Good morning guys. Thanks for the time this morning. Travis Stice : Hi, David. David Deckelbaum : Just wanted to revisit that last point on the balance sheet. You talked about the mid-decade maturities. Is there -- can you remind us, is there an absolute sort of debt target that you have if you\u2019re factoring in a $60 mid-cycle price? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I kind of think about absolute getting down to $3.5 billion-ish at Diamondback and $1 billion-ish at the subs. So $4.5 million total. I think that keeps you very well protected even at a mid-cycle price turn or so. But more importantly, average maturity getting extended is going to be important because that clears the way for more shareholder returns between now and 2029 when our next big note would be due. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that. And then just my second question. The slide where you were referencing cost inflation looked like it rolled up to about 15% overall. The reference point was the third quarter of 2020, where I think we were paying people to stick oil in swimming pools. So 15% seems relatively benign since then. I\u2019m curious what your outlook is on what you can do and what you\u2019re factoring in, in terms of cost inflation into the 2023, 2024 time line. And would you \u2013 do you think that there\u2019s still room to offset that with efficiencies? And are you changing how you\u2019re contracting for services right now? Travis Stice : Well, you always want your organization to continue to look for the efficiencies on the variable side. And it\u2019s hard to forecast what those are. But it\u2019s not hard to try to incentivize the culture that looks for those efficiency gains. And what they\u2019re going to look like in 2023 and 2024, I can\u2019t tell you, but I know we\u2019re going to continue to look for it. And I know if past performance is a good indication, we\u2019ll continue to lead the back on these type of efficiencies. Contracting long term for more of the consumables on the fixed side of the equation, those have typically been very difficult for our industry because the time that the operator wants to lock in is the time that the service provider doesn\u2019t. We\u2019re always at odds and ends of the spectrum. So like right now, the consumable guys on the service side would love to lock in these all-time high prices. Operators are reluctant to do so. So Diamondback has the size and the scale to have very meaningful conversation with our business partners on the service side. And we have those quarterly or every six months. And that\u2019s the way that we\u2019ve chosen to manage that relationship. And most of our service providers we\u2019ve had now for over five years, and we\u2019ve got a really good business relationship with them. Look, their margins have to expand. We understand that. But our commitment to be best-in-class and the highest margin remains unchanged as well, too. So it\u2019s not a straightforward calculus, David, that I can lay out for you. But I can tell you that the organization will we continue to lean into it. And I\u2019m very confident certainly for 2022 that we\u2019ll be able to do so. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And one comment on Slide 10, David. Slide 10 tells you exactly what we\u2019re saying, right? The rig line and the stimulation line, rig rates are up, frac rates are up, but the efficiencies that have been gained as seen in the top half of the page means that those pieces of the well costs have not risen like fixed costs like fuel or cement or casing. David Deckelbaum : Absolutely, and thanks for pointing that out and congrats on all the promotions. Thanks for the answers. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thanks, David. Travis Stice : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question is from Jeoffrey Lambujon of Tudor Pickering Holt. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just one for me on ESG. Obviously, a lot of progress made on the initiatives that you set out in September with your sustainability report just looking at that section of the slide deck that you highlighted. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about what you\u2019re focused on this year. I know you hit on flaring already. And then thinking further out, it would be interesting to hear about what sort of projects you could see yourselves investing in and continue to make progress on offsetting emissions. Travis Stice : Yes. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that we\u2019re committing, I don\u2019t know, $20 million or so per year for the next several years to eliminate flaring and to significantly reduce methane emissions. And tactically, that\u2019s translated on the methane side to overhauling and reconfiguring a lot of our old, mostly acquired tank batteries that have gas pneumatics. I think we\u2019ve got a slide in there that actually points that out. Yes. Gas pneumatics, you can see what that is on Slides 19 and 20. But that\u2019s been the first focus area is the gas pneumatics. And Danny, we\u2019re probably halfway through getting those batteries changed, third to halfway through? Danny Wesson : Yes. We kind of laid out the framework to get through them all in three to four years, a couple of years ago. So we\u2019re about halfway through with the battery upgrades and still working on leak detection and repair initiatives, and then flaring is our main drivers of methane emissions. Travis Stice : And then Jeff, on methane emissions, there\u2019s just an amazing amount of innovative technology that\u2019s coming out from the service side. And we\u2019re not \u2013 we haven\u2019t picked a winner yet. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s been a clear winner, but our approach has been to field test all of them. We\u2019ve probably got five or six leading edge technology methane sensors in the field in order to monitor these things, monitor methane emissions in real time. So we\u2019re investing alongside these technology companies on methane emissions. And then as Danny mentioned, flaring is something we\u2019re really leaning hard into and I can\u2019t emphasize enough that we can do everything we can on our side, but if we don\u2019t get our midstream partners on the G&P side to participate it\u2019s going to be very difficult for our industry to meet our goal of reducing or eliminating routine flaring as defined by the World Bank. So there is a reason we\u2019re being pointed in our presentation today about asking to work collaboratively with our G&P partners on the flaring side. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great. Thank you. Danny Wesson : Thanks, Jeoff. Operator : Your next question is from Nitin Kumar of Wells Fargo. Nitin Kumar : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of ground has been covered on the cash return side. But I want to check on the base dividend. You mentioned earlier that it could be about 25% of free cash flow of the return portion of free cash flow in 2022. How are you thinking about it beyond the $3 per share. Is that a good limit? Or could we see more increases in what would drive that? Travis Stice : Well, it really depends on what the market conditions look like at that point. I mean we can\u2019t continue to grow at 10% per quarter forever, right? At $3 a share, that\u2019s over $500 million a year of financial debt is how I look at it. So I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a limit, but I\u2019m saying that, that\u2019s certainly what our near-term focus is to get to that $3 a share. Nitin Kumar : And I guess what I was asking was is there a percentage of cash flow that you\u2019re targeting or something like that at a mid-cycle price? Like how do you come up with that level? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. We look at it more on the breakeven side. So pre-dividend breakeven right now, $30 a barrel. I think that number stays fairly consistent here over the coming years as capital efficiency stays strong, base declines are reduced. And then above that, our large shareholders universally have said they want a base dividend that\u2019s protected below $40 oil. Right now, the base dividend was protected at $35. That will go up over time, but you also might have less shares over time, less debt. So that frees up some more cash to go to the dividend. But overall, cash returns have been widely discussed over the last couple of quarters. And the only thing we have universally heard from large long-owned leases more base dividend sooner. And that\u2019s why Travis is making a commitment to get to three by year-end with Board support, should conditions remain. Nitin Kumar : Got it. And Travis, very quick question here, but you \u2013 I think you mentioned 400 rigs in the Permian in a year or so. We\u2019ve talked here a little bit about Permian takeaway on the gas and NGL side. But what are the other challenges that the basin could face if we do see that kind of growth? And how are you positioned to be ahead of that? Travis Stice : Well, I think if you\u2019re asking what are some of those constraints going to be if you get to 400 and what Diamondback is doing to prepare for that? Well, again, a part of it goes back to the long-standing relationship we have with our service partners. But secondarily, anything that requires boots or tires in the Permian Basin is going to continue to be tight. And that means we\u2019re going to have to attract \u2013 as an industry, we\u2019re going to have to attract more workers into the Permian Basin like we did in 2018, 2019. And that\u2019s going to \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that translate to an increase in labor costs. But again, those cost increases are going to paint pretty much all of us with the same brush. And we\u2019ll focus, like I tried to highlight earlier, we\u2019ll focus on the variable side, things we can actually do something about. But 400, what do we peak at Danny, out here in the Permian. Danny Wesson : Particularly like 490, and we exited pre-pandemic around 400 rigs. Travis Stice : So we\u2019re \u2013 even though I think those rigs are a little bit more efficient today than they were then, we\u2019re approaching or will approach by the end of this year sort of where we were at the end of 2019. Nitin Kumar : Okay. Thanks for the answers guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Nitin. Danny Wesson : Thanks, Nitin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Leo Mariani of KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : Hi guys. I just wanted to ask a question on the potential for FANG to return to a little bit of production growth at some point. You clearly mentioned that here in 2022 with the looming threat of Iranian barrels it was certainly one of the key issues that was keeping you guys away from growing. And also, based on your comments, maybe we\u2019re not quite back to pre-pandemic demand but we\u2019re very close. So as we look into next year, if we are above pre-pandemic demand levels and the Iranian situation has resolved itself one way or the other, could that be the time where maybe we see some modest growth from FANG? And how do you think about what the right level of growth is eventually? Travis Stice : Yes. I don\u2019t know what the right level of growth will be or when it\u2019s going to occur. I can tell you definitively right now, what\u2019s being valued by our investors is a shareholder return program. And no one wants to see that shareholder return program put at risk with volume growth, not for Diamondback specifically for our industry in total. So look, the world will be calling for oil growth at some point in the future. And our industry is going to have to figure out the right way to respond while not putting the shareholder return program at risk. We\u2019ve spent the last decade consuming capital and now we\u2019ve got a little bit of sunshine in us where we can return that capital to our investors that have been waiting patiently and sometimes impatiently for this return. So it\u2019s a good question to ask, Leo, but I can \u2013 I can\u2019t give you the time at which Diamondback or the industry is going to respond to growth. But I\u2019ll tell you, when we do, it\u2019s going to be in conjunction with creating unreasonable value for our shareholders. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : If we do. Travis Stice : If we do. Leo Mariani : Okay. Understood. And I just wanted to ask quickly on the 2022 guidance here. Maybe just starting with the CapEx. It\u2019s a fairly good range, $1.75 billion to $1.9 billion you did describe having a percentage of some of the services locked in for the year here. So just definitely wanted to get your thoughts on kind of what the $150 million variability could be here in 2022? Because it sounds like you\u2019re not going to change the program and there really won\u2019t be production growth. And then just additionally, looking at the production side of the guidance. If my math is right, it looks like you guys either were kind of the very high end of the oil every quarter in 2021 or actually beat it. So as you\u2019re kind of looking at that guide in 2022, should we be thinking that you always have a slight bit of conservatism to allow for things that could go wrong in the field. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the production and CapEx guide in 2022. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think we always take a little conservatism for the good guys into our plan. Drilling and completing 280 wells at the \u2013 at your AFE number for a year is not an easy task. It might look easy for me in my Excel model but actually doing it in the field is pretty darn impressive. So we certainly want to give some room for guys to do what they do in the field, but also service costs are going up. I mean, Travis mentioned a very high rig count number in the Permian. If that number comes to fruition, there\u2019s going to be pressure on all the variable costs and the fixed cost in this basin. So fortunately, we have the 12 rigs we need. We have the three simul-frac crews we need. This is not a year where we need to go find eight crews \u2013 or eight rigs and three crews. We might have to pay them a little more to keep working for us, but that\u2019s the risk for the high end in the back half of the year. Leo Mariani : Okay, it\u2019s definitely helpful. Thanks guys. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Thanks, Leo. Operator : Your next question is from Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis and Kaes and the rest of the team there. Travis Stice : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, this goes back to some of your earlier comments about the \u2013 really what seems like a linchpin for your strategy, this idea of a mid-cycle oil price, why is $60 the right price? Travis Stice : Yes. We asked that question every day. But one of the things that\u2019s \u2013 when I ask that question, one of the responses I got was, what do you think the average price was for the last seven years, and that\u2019s $53 a barrel. It\u2019s really easy to get you fork about $90-plus oil. And in fact, I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I think I\u2019m seeing some of that for you in our industry right now, certainly in the commentary that\u2019s out there. But we know geopolitically, there\u2019s dollars that are in today\u2019s oil price that God willing will be resolved without arms conflict. We know that there\u2019s Iranian barrels that are probably coming on, I said, by the end of the year, but it may be at the end of this month. And we\u2019ve got this further in the Permian Basin that\u2019s continuing to lift U.S. production forecast. And while OPEC hasn\u2019t performed up to their 400,000 barrels per day per month production increases, but I think they\u2019re getting closer to it. And I don\u2019t know what their surplus is, but it\u2019s not zero yet. So all of those things, to me, you add them together actually seem to be a little bit more bearish for crude than it does to be optimistic. And the other thing is if we\u2019re wrong and oil price is higher, we\u2019re going to generate a lot of free cash flow, and our investors are going to get a lot of that return to them. And if I\u2019m right, then we\u2019ve protected our investments, and we\u2019ve made the right decisions. So $60, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a hard and fast number, but it\u2019s kind of the aperture at which we start all of our decisions on investments, whether it\u2019s M&A or drilling wells or share buybacks. Charles Meade : That\u2019s helpful, Travis. It seems as good as any other number to me. I just wanted to hear more of your thinking. Quick follow-up. I noticed that you guys said you drilled \u2013 or I think we\u2019ve drilled and completed a Barnett well in the quarter. Was that on the \u2013 I\u2019m guessing that was on the Limelight acreage. And is there any kind of rate of change there that was worth highlighting? Danny Wesson : Yes. We drilled a couple of wells there. I think we have a couple of planned this year. It\u2019s still early in the testing phase, but at $90 oil, it certainly competes even at $60 oil, including the low entry cost, it competes on a full cycle basis, but not yet does it compete with our core Midland and Delaware Basin position. Travis Stice : And I think one add is to that is that right now, we\u2019re drilling single wells. And there\u2019s a huge cost inefficiency when you\u2019re drilling single wells trying to delineate a play. Once you move into full cycle development and you can drill at least four wells, simul-frac operations, and combine that with the efficient drilling operations, you can drive a lot of cost out of the equation, which raises the economics on a play like Limelight and actually makes us start to compete for our capital with the other items in our portfolio. Charles Meade : Got it. Thanks for the detail guys. Travis Stice : Thank you, Charles. Operator : I will now turn it back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's first quarter earnings call. In February, Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. We at Diamondback strongly condemned Russia's actions and aggression. Our thoughts and prayers are with the millions of men, women and children affected by this unjust war. And while we desire a quick and peaceful resolution to this conflict, we recognize that this war could go on for quite some time. We will continue to support the innocent victims of Ukraine just as we did earlier this year, when we announced a $10 million commitment to various non-profit entities providing vital humanitarian support. Russia's actions have plunged the global energy markets into turmoil. As the world and especially our allies in the European Union grapple with the potential loss of a major source of their energy supply and rethink their respective energy policies, this war has magnified the interconnectivity of the global energy equation and the impact post-Cold War globalization has had on all supply chains. It has also reminded the world of the importance of the traditional oil and gas to the global economy as we're witnessing the impact high energy costs can have on the consumer and the economy in real time. As the war in Ukraine and the resulting governmental sanctions continue, Russia's oil production is expected to be impacted by shut-ins, natural declines, storage limitations and lower exports, creating a global shortage of oil. Over the next few years, we will need to make up for this lost production, and we believe that the U.S. oil and gas industry is best suited to provide the low-cost environmentally-friendly barrels needed to ensure global energy supply. However, today, we are operating in a constrained environment with inflationary pressures continuing to increase across all facets of our business. Also labor and materials shortages are now present across the supply chain. We at Diamondback are fortunate to have secured the necessary equipment, personnel and materials to run our 2022 capital program, but increase in activity now would result in capital efficiency degradation that would not meaningfully contribute to fixing the global supply and demand imbalance in the oil market today. Therefore, Diamondback remains committed to maintaining our current oil production levels of approximately 220,000 net barrels of oil per day. While we believe that efficiently growing our production base is achievable over the long term, we do not feel that today is the appropriate time to begin spending dollars that would not equate to additional barrels into multiple quarters from now. We continue to focus on capital efficiency and strive to operate with the highest level of environmental and social responsibility. At Diamondback, we plan to invest approximately $60 million to reduce our direct emissions and lower our carbon intensity, including ending routine flaring by 2025. This figure does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars we expend to electrify our production fields and to build pipelines to ensure we produce and transport fluid with the lowest emission intensity possible. These investments are not only good for the environment, but also smart economic decisions that we expect to lower our operating costs. By investing in infrastructure in our high activity levels, we now have the ability to run a dedicated electric fleet for the foreseeable future. We've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first electric frac fleet, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from the central location and delivered via existing lines, reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile. This partnership will also lower our cost per foot, primarily due to fuel savings, decrease our footprint on location and increase our operational efficiency as a result of lower maintenance and non-productive time. We expect this fleet to be operational in the fourth quarter. In 2021, we also announced initiatives to reduce our Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions or GHG intensity by at least 50% and reduced methane intensity by at least 70% of from 2019 levels by 2024. In 2021 alone, we reduced our Scope 1 GHG and methane intensities by 15% and 21%, respectively, from the 2020 levels. Lastly, we launched our Net Zero Now strategy under which, as of January 1, 2021, every hydrocarbon produced by Diamondback is anticipated to have zero net Scope 1 GHG emissions as we offset these emissions with certified carbon credits. Moving to first quarter performance. Our production of 223,000 barrels of oil exceeded the high end of our guidance range, creating $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. We were able to keep our capital costs in check, spending $437 million in CapEx during the quarter, nearly hitting the low end of our guidance range of $435 million to $475 million, and pushing our free cash flow for the quarter to $974 million. We returned $555 million of cash back to our stockholders or $3.09 per share representing 57% of Q1 2022 free cash flow and 50% of adjusted free cash flow, which we calculated by adding back the $135 million in cash we used to terminate certain future hedge positions. This return was made up of stock repurchases, the base dividend in our first variable dividend. As we've said in the past, our share repurchase program is opportunistic, and we stuck with our plan of evaluating our share repurchases just as we would with any acquisition. A buyback must generate a return well in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, assuming a reasonable mid-cycle oil price. In the first quarter, our price debt was approximately $60 a barrel, and as such, we were able to take advantage of some of the volatility in the new market and repurchased 57,000 shares at an average price of $117 a share. Through the end of the first quarter, we've spent about $440 million or 22% of the $2 billion program our Board authorized last September. Additionally, we once again increased our growing base dividend, which we view as our primary, constant and predictable form of shareholder returns. It's now at $2.80 a share on an annualized basis, up 17% quarter-over-quarter and approaching our target of $3 a share. We have now increased our base dividend by a quarterly CAGR of over 11% since it was initiated in 2018. Today, this represents a current yield of just over 2%. Finally, with the free cash flow returns through our base dividend and repurchase program does not equal at least 50% of our free cash flow for that particular quarter, and we've committed to make our investors whole by distributing the rest of that free cash flow via a variable dividend. This strategy gives us the ability to be flexible and opportunistic when distributing capital above and beyond our base dividend and most importantly, allows at least 50% of free cash flow to be returned. For our strategy, we allocated $422 million to our first variable dividend this quarter or $2.35 per share, putting our total dividend payout in the first quarter at $3.05 per share or nearly a 10% total dividend yield. We met our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to our stockholders and use the remaining cash to strengthen our financial and operating position. In the quarter, we fully redeemed $500 million of notes due in 2024 and $1 billion of notes due in 2025. We also took advantage of the flat long end of the curve by pricing $750 million in new 30-year senior notes at 4.25%. This liability management exercise reduced our absolute debt by $750 million, decreased annual interest expense by $20 million, pushed out the average weighted maturity of our debt profile by 5 years and kept our average weighted cost of debt flat. With only one tranche of near-term maturities outstanding, we are pleased with the progress we've made to improve our investment-grade balance sheet and are nearing our leverage target of approximately 1x at $50 oil which would equate to approximately $3.5 billion in absolute debt at the parent level. We also continue to put our cash to work by high grading our existing inventory position through small bolt-on acquisitions. And we are excited about blocking up our reward position with the acquisition we completed in January. This bolt-on added approximately 6,000 net acres in Ward County and gave us an additional 60 long lateral locations with an 85% net revenue interest in a high rate of return area. In fact, we've already begun drilling the position, but do not expect to have production until late this year. As we look to our outlook for the rest of 2022, our simple plan has not changed. Maintained oil production of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day by spending between $1.75 billion and $1.9 billion. At the current strip pricing, this production and capital spend equates to approximately 400 -- $4.5 billion of free cash flow, which per our returns framework, gives us a minimum of $2.25 billion of cash back to our investors. We're off to a good start for the year, mitigating inflationary pressures while justifying our social and environmental license to operate. We believe our capital discipline and returns profile is still the best near-term path to equity value creation, while our operational execution provides differentiated returns to our shareholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Travis, first question really, the obvious just on shareholder return and odds. Specifically -- well, I guess maybe tackling it a little bit different. I'm just wondering what levers would you all think about pulling if oil were to go potentially in a super spike scenario, where if Russia oil would decouple or if oil completely goes the other way and rolls, assuming something happens to Putin. So I'm really just trying to get a sense of what sort of quarterly changes you would or would not make if this were to happen down the line. Travis Stice : Well, certainly, from a quarterly perspective, from an operational perspective, we're pretty set on this year's plan. And we have the ability, obviously, to ratchet things down, but as I tried to lay out in our prepared remarks, ratcheting things up right now is not really the right answer. If you're asking a question specifically about buybacks, Neal, we're going to stay disciplined in our approach to buying our stock back. When we look at mid-teens returns or mid-cycle pricing, that's really not changing. I think what matters most though, Neal, is that we're returning cash to shareholders, and we're giving our shareholders the flexibility to do with that cash as they see fit. That's kind of how I view the world right now, Neal. Neal Dingmann : No, I like that flexibility. I think it makes a lot of sense as I think investors do. Then my second question just on your capital guidance, specifically looking at the $150 million of inflation, the $125 DUC benefit and then the $60 midstream incremental moves that you talked about since '21, really just wondering, is there a potential for each of these to move further this year? And then does this sort of '22 spend set you up for a stable '23 production? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neal, I don't see any changes. I mean I think we're seeing inflationary pressures across the value chain. Fortunately, we baked a lot of that into our guidance for the year. And fortunately, we had a strong Q1, which if you annualize Q1, you'd be towards the low end of the range. So it gives us a little flexibility in the back half of the year. And second to that, I think we're debating internally what does 2023 and beyond look like. We're not ready to give an answer to that today. But it doesn't mean that the plan is zero growth forever. I think we have the flexibility to ramp up a little bit if we needed to, if that was the decision come kind of late summer for 2023 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Travis Stice : Arun, are you on mute? Arun Jayaram : Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't hear my name. Sorry about that. Travis, I want to get your thoughts. Obviously, looking at the near-term performance of the stock, you've clearly lagged your oil beta as well as our sense of execution, which has been good in the field. So I was wondering if you and/or Kaes could talk a little bit about the bear thesis on the stock. As you know, there's a number of properties on the market in the Permian and the market appears to be concerned about Diamondback executing perhaps a procyclical type of M&A deal in this type of environment as the buyback pace has waned a bit. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about that and just your broader thoughts on M&A in this kind of $100-plus oil environment. Travis Stice : Arun, if I could control the price of stock, it would be a lot higher than it is today, granted. But I can't. But what we can control is how we allocate capital, how we execute in the field, how we can generate more cash per barrels than anyone else. Those are the things that we really can control. It is -- we do hear a lot about this narrative that Diamondback is a serial acquirer, and let me just put it simply. Large-scale M&A today is quite frankly, off the table. We've got nothing on our deal sheet that's considered more than a tuck-in like the one just announced in my prepared remarks. This remains a seller's market, and we're not going to underwrite M&A at today's oil prices, just like we're not going to underwrite repurchasing stocks at today's oil prices. So I hope that's clear in both of those 2 points that I made, Arun. Arun Jayaram : Great, great. So it sounds like large-scale M&A is off the table today, if I -- based on those comments. Travis Stice : Yes. Let me reiterate that. Large-scale M&A is off the table. I'll reiterate that point. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Yes. That's clear. The second point I wanted to make is just looking at the cash flow statement for calendar 2022, on our model which is a bit below the strip call it, $6.2 billion, $6.4 billion of CFO, a little under $1.9 million of CapEx. If we go through all of the uses of cash including nearly $800 million of debt reduction year-to-date, we'd still get 1 -- over $1.2 billion of cash build this year. So I was wondering if you could talk about some of the priorities for this excess cash. I think you highlighted maybe a debt target for FANG, stand-alone at $3.5 billion. But I was wondering maybe you could talk about uses of cash if this high commodity price environment continues. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Arun, good question. I wouldn't say $3.5 billion is a hard and fast number before we ramp up shareholder returns, but certainly would like to take advantage of this market by taking out our 2026 notes and, therefore, not having any near-term maturities before 2029, which opens up the door for accelerated cash returns. I think that's going to happen sooner rather than later. Just generally, we do want to keep a cash balance, but we're not going to sit on a large cash balance, and we think no debt isn't the right answer. So we're not going to sit on it. And therefore, we're going to return it. This is an active discussion we have with our Board every quarter on cash returns. And I think generally, we're going to be supportive of more cash returns as the balance sheet is put in fortress shape. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Nitin Kumar from Wells Fargo. Nitin Kumar : I want to start with Permian takeaway on the gas side has been a topic of discussion over the last 3 months or so. Just want to see what you guys are seeing on the ground and maybe if you could talk a little bit about your low assurance into '23 and '24? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Nitin, I think people are -- on the midstream and the upstream side, are coming together to solve this problem. And you've seen a couple of announcements on expansions of a couple of existing pipes in the last couple of weeks. We still think there needs to be a large pipe built, new-build pipe, which hopefully happens here in the next month or 2 from an announcement perspective. And generally, going back to what we said last quarter, we have -- we don't have take-in-kind rights for all of our gas, but we do have full assurance for all of our gas. So we are exposed to Waha. We've hedged much of our exposure in 2023. And we think that's the tight spot. And the gas is going to move. It's just a matter of price. And I think there's a lot of constraints on Permian growth right now as we've seen anecdotes from others on trying to ramp activity into this constrained environment. So generally, I think the gas thing gets solved. I think both sides are as incentivized as ever to build the pipes and that should clear the way for Permian growth in the out years. Nitin Kumar : Great. As my follow-up, inflation did not feature as prominently in your release as it did for others, but you did talk about constraints. Kaes, you also mentioned possibly looking for growth. Are there any specific areas as we look into 2023 that are tighter on the supply chain side? And maybe talk a little bit about how you're contracting for those services right now. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I would say right now, everything is tight across the board, whether it's sand, casing, new high-spec rigs, frac crews; everything is very, very tight. We're doing our part by keeping our activity levels flat. We're running the 12 rigs we need and we're running the 3 simul-frac tractors we need with a fourth spot crew. But hearing anecdotes of not being able to get casing, not being able to get sand, these are things that we've done our best to secure, and I think we're in a really good position. And it kind of ties to what Travis was saying, is if you're going to bet on someone in an inflationary environment, it's Diamondback. I mean we control costs as well as anybody in this business, and that's what we're laser-focused on in 2022. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : If I could kind of flash back to the shareholder returns kind of strategy here, and I think you guys have been pretty articulate in how you think of a big picture. But -- and Travis, I know you made a point of one -- ones here earlier in this call about does it make sense to buy back Diamondback stock at this point in time. So when we think about how you return that cash going forward, should we anticipate at kind of heightened oil price levels, you are going to stick to say, that $60 mid-cycle price and the large quantum of return likely is going to be in a variable dividend? Is that how we should think about it until there's a more material pullback in sort of the equities here? Travis Stice : Yes. I think that's a reasonable approach. But Scott, I also think you have to be cognizant of what our industry has done over the last 10 years in respect to share repurchases. We've typically, as an industry, chased the oil price and repurchased shares back all the way to the top. We're trying to be mindful of that and disciplined in our approach. And I've tried to be as articulate as I could about the way that we think about share repurchases as any other form of capital allocation with that mid-cycle oil price. Mid-cycle oil price isn't -- [it's like] oil price, it doesn't change. Now what could change is that as we continue to accumulate cash, that's going to have an influence on our future capital allocation, both in the form of share repurchases and increased variable payouts. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I wouldn't say we haven't had opportunities. I mean we've had opportunities even in Q2 to repurchase shares given the volatility in this space. So there's enough volatility out there to give us opportunities. And I would say the share repurchase is more defensive than offensive. And when things are going really, really well like they did in the first quarter, we make up the difference with the variable dividend. Scott Hanold : Got it. Appreciate that. And on the first quarter results, what to me stood out was your oil price realizations were extremely strong. Can you talk about the dynamics specifically in the quarter and if that's continuing at this point in time? It looked like you all got average premium to WTI pricing. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I would say it was more one-off than anything, but the volatility in Brent and Dated Brent, in particular, versus WTI benefited us. I'd say about 30% of our oil production received a Dated Brent price for barrels going to Europe, and that was in our favor there in Q1. So I think generally, we've always guided to 95% of WTI as our realization. That might need to move up a little bit, particularly with WTI going up as much as it has, but it's going to be tough to hit 100 consistently. Operator : Our next question is from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Thanks, Travis and Kaes and Danny, thanks for squeezing me in. Travis, I wanted to just follow up on your comments that you made around capital efficiency degradation for deploying capital in today's environment. I guess how do you think about those conditions resulting in improved capital efficiency over time? I guess it sounds like the variables are that -- there really just isn't very much availability of equipment, significant delays. I know that you guys are benefiting from having prepurchased a lot of -- some of the raw materials for this year's program. But I guess, are we to think about -- when you talk specifically around capital efficiency, if you stood up a rig today, that the free cash payback period on that would be significantly longer than the year? Travis Stice : Yes, I think there's 2 points. Your first one is correct that capital efficiency does imply that the payout for that investment is much longer, notwithstanding the fact that the production from that, the way we develop these assets with multi-well pads is quarters away. The second thing is, is that in the hyperinflationary environment like we are in the Permian right now, standing up the rig using your example really means that we're, in most instances, we're going to be taking that rig away from somebody else. So -- and that applies to really all services. And -- so if you're looking to increase the total barrel production out of the Permian, you just really need to be reallocating, so it's not really helping the global supply/demand equation because that's really how tight the services are out here today. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, it was more a macro comment that the service market is a zero-sum game right now and us stepping on the accelerator would result in someone else not. And so we want to maintain that capital efficiency that we have and the trust that we've earned with investors that this is the plan. Travis Stice : We've seen in the past in these hyper inflationary environments that supply chains ultimately normalize. But it takes time for that normalization to occur, which is measured in quarters, if not years for it to normalize. And when it does, then you start to have a greater opportunity to grow without degrading your capital efficiency. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate the responses, Travis. The last one for me is just on the Ward County acquisition, it sounds like you guys are already drilling some of those locations there. I guess when you're making a -- when you're making an acquisition right now, I know you said large scale is off the table. But are these smaller deals -- should we think about these locations moving to the front of your program? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. These were some pretty high-returning locations mainly because the acreage has an 84% NRI. So an extra 9% NRI was about 1/3 of the deal value. And so that makes a completely undeveloped unit in the Delaware basin very competitive with Midland Basin unit. So I'd say this deal is the exception versus the norm. It was agreed to about 6 months ago. But if other opportunities like that come about, I think it's a good use of cash as long as we're not impacting our cash return program. Operator : Our next question is from Derrick Whitfield from Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on your quarter-end update. Following up on David's first question, could you broadly outline the macro and investor conditions that would support a decision to pursue growth over 5% per annum? Travis Stice : I think what you're asking us to do is start forecasting 2023 growth rates that we're not really ready to talk about 2023. I think though, Derrick, if you look at the macro uncertainties that are still out there, let me try to enumerate some of those. You've still got Iranian barrels, whether they're going to find a way in the market. You've got Venezuela, you've got Libya, you've got continued a little bit of surplus capacity in the OPEC+. Those are all volumes that can come on to the equation of the supply-demand equation. You've also got the continued demand impacts of COVID, particularly in the Asian markets right now. And then lastly, to say bluntly, the administration's comments are certainly causing a lot of uncertainty in the market, both in the terms of regulatory taxation, legislation and negative rhetoric towards our industry. And that creates uncertainty in our owners', our shareholders' minds about what the future of this industry really is. And so I think this represents on that front, a pretty unique time to have a sober assessment of what an energy policy really needs to look like for the United States, one that recognizes all forms of energy, while at the same time, having aspirational goals about a more sustainable future. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks, Travis. I certainly appreciate those comments and understand those. As my second question, I wanted to follow up on gas egress and more specifically, your view on how you'd like to position Diamondback in the value chain for LNG offtake. With the understanding that you are an oil company at the core, have you evaluated or would you consider direct offtake contracts with European utilities to better position Diamondback for higher realizations? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think we consider it, Derrick, we just want to have control of enough molecules to do anything meaningful. This goes back to the take-in-kind rights, right? We sell -- we exchange to the custody of the molecule at the wellhead outside of 200 million a day we have on the Whistler pipeline going down to Katy in South Texas. So we really don't have control over a lot of gas. The company's grown through acquisitions. A Lot of times, the gas came dedicated already with no take-in-kind rights for that operator. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Scott Gruber : I guess just listening to the conversation here this morning you guys mentioned the e-frac coming in during 4Q and how that will help efficiency. And there's obviously been various drilling optimization software that has been developed to help trim those drill times. Is there an ability for Diamondback to grow volumes modestly without adding an additional rig or 2 and more frac time? Or is that just not possible? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think it's certainly possible, Scott, and certainly it's part of our assessment of where we're headed and also ties into this mantra of capital efficient growth or capital efficient maintenance. It's amazing what the organization has done in terms of efficiencies. Three simul-frac fleets have doubled our efficiency on the frac side. And on the drilling side, like you mentioned, the clear fluid drilling system as well as moving on to electrification has reduced costs and cycle times. So I certainly think it's possible, and we continue to see improvements throughout this year and certainly going into our calculus for what does the next few years look like. Travis Stice : And Scott, when you think about the improvements that Kaes just talked about that are operationally and execution focused, those are made irrespective of commodity price or service costs. And what's exciting about those and what I'm so proud of our organization about is those are permanent. Those are permanent savings that go forward. And when you start doing the relative game to Diamondback versus others' performance, that's what creates the spread. And this is not just a recent phenomenon. Our organization, their stock and trade has been these types of incremental improvements year-over-year regardless of the economic or commodity price backdrop. And I think it's fair that we're going to continue to do that. It gets harder in times like today, but it doesn't mean that we still can't find differential ways to do more with less. And the second point is that as we fully embrace the Northern Midland Basin with the assets that we acquired through Guidon and QEP coming on the production mix back half of this year and fully into 2023. Those wells are so good, you will see a natural uptick in capital efficiency because we -- those wells deliver more per dollar spent. Scott Gruber : Got you. Yes. I guess that was the kind of heart of my question is, is there enough kind of incremental gain on the kind of process efficiency coupled with the Martin County program hitting its full stride? Is there enough combination there that you can actually achieve, call it, 5% growth without adding an additional rig? Kaes Van' t Hof : We'll see. It's still early. So we'll see. I think we're really focused on getting through the rest of this year in a very tight inflationary environment. Operator : Next question is from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering. Jeoffrey Lambujon : My first one is just a follow-up on some of the cost commentary from earlier, if you wouldn't mind sharing some additional insight that you've got just given your history in the basin. But with your outlook for well cost per foot for the year, in particular staying consistent with the initial guide even as other operators are talking up quarter-to-quarter changes with uncertainty beyond that as you go through the year, I just wanted to ask about what you are doing in the field to mitigate higher costs you might be experiencing or just plans to -- for activity in the field to mitigate expected costs in the future just in terms of flexibility around who you contract with for services while still maintaining and upholding the low-cost operations that Diamondback's known for? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Jeff. I mean we've obviously baked in some inflation into these costs and went into the year at a lower well cost when we went into 2021 and even in the face of an inflationary environment last year. But generally, there are service providers pushing price. And sometimes we decide not to keep working with those particular service providers. So I think our ability to control costs is because we control a lot of the process with our business partners on the service side. We recognize they need to make margin. But if there is another provider that can provide the same service for less cost, we'll go that route. And we've done that a few times this year. So that's helped us control things a little bit. Travis Stice : And Jeff, those are true strategic comments that Kaes just made. But look, tactically, what we continue to see is our operations organization getting the TD faster on a quarterly basis. And that kind of goes back to the comments I made earlier. This is what we do. So getting the TD faster translates to cost savings that become permanent. Also completing more lateral feet per day as an efficiency gain this year is another one of those tactical things that we're doing that's helping us hold the line on an increasing cost backdrop. So -- and just to emphasize, we always get the question asked, what is it that makes the secret sauce of Diamondback in our low-cost operations as you just pointed out. And it's really not 1 or 2 things. It's really a consistent laser focus on every single decision that we make that spends dollars. And the cumulative effect of that laser-like focus allows Diamondback just not on a quarterly basis, but now almost for a 10-year time period, maintain the lowest cost operations and the best execution out in the Permian. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Perfect. I appreciate the detail and the reminders. My second one is just on the balance sheet, really just around what you see what's left on the opportunity for further strengthening from here. I know you all talked about and flagged that 2026 is in the past and spoke to debt targets that can also be flexible. But it seems like you are within striking distance here of an optimal balance sheet position for the medium to long term. So just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that given the progress you've made so far, especially recently. And I apologize if I missed this earlier. Kaes Van' t Hof : No. Listen, I think we feel fine with everything we have due 2029 or later sitting out there. And if we take care of the 2026 is, which should be in a matter of months, not years, we'll be in a position to have discussions about increasing shareholder returns beyond what we're already doing. Operator : Our next question is from Nicholas Pope from Seaport Research. Nicholas Pope : First, I wanted to commend you guys on that ESG kind of real-time data that you are providing because I think it's probably one of the best in the sector. But you provide the data, so I've got a question about it a little bit. You kind of talked about kind of gross gas flared. And I saw in 1Q, it kind of creeped up from kind of where it was in fourth quarter, where it was in the first quarter of last year as kind of a percent of total like gross gas production. So I was curious, like is it -- what drives that? Is there some seasonality in that? Is it -- I mean, is it limited capacity to move gas? I mean I'm just trying to understand a little bit about kind of the movement in that metric, which is a big part of kind of the CO2 emissions, I think that you all report. Travis Stice : Sure, Nick. Two things. The first comment on disclosure, I appreciate you saying that. Our Board has mandated us to not only be best-in-class on actual performance, but also best-in-class in disclosure. And there's a lot of our organization that is focused on delivering these results, and we're proud to report them. And I think if those who haven't had a chance that are on the call to look at the ESG detail in our investor deck, which is up on our website, I strongly encourage you to do that. The second part of your question, Nick, was gross gas. And that's -- the reason we reported that is because that's a way that you can back calculate and verify our numbers, but that has to do with the acquired volumes. Kaes? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, it's all due to plant turnarounds, right? I mean we put out a slide that explains that 75% to 80% of our flaring is due to downstream issues. And we're trying to push and incentivize our business partners on the midstream side to do better in terms of flaring, sometimes through contracts where we pay them more per Mcf, if take pay less than 1%. But really, timing-wise, Q1, a lot of turnarounds from some of our business partners on the midstream side. There is some seasonality to it, but that's why we push them for more interconnectivity among their peers, so that if their plant goes down, they can send it to another plant or to a peer and we'll still pay them. So part of the whole value chain is we need our friends on the G&T side to work with us here. Travis Stice : And Nick, we view that as a win-win or a lose-lose. So we're not trying to position ourselves as a win versus lose on the G&T side. We know that emissions from the product we produce need to be eliminated and minimized as quickly as we can. And that's the reason that we spend time in conversations like this talking about our G&T business partners as well as including some slides in the ESG detailed part of the deck that highlights what Diamondback was responsible for and what our midstream guys were responsible for both planned and unplanned outages. Nicholas Pope : Got it. That's actually very helpful. I appreciate it. And kind of further on to the kind of the other components of this, you kind of talked about the electrification of compression of parts of the frac fleets. Is that something that -- is that going to be showing up as part of the LOE kind of improvements that you're working on? Is that where it shows up? Or is it primarily going to be something that is reflected in these ESG metrics when you think about that move towards the electrification of a lot of assets? Kaes Van' t Hof : Well, electrification in the field helps LOE. So electrifying all of our fields is not only environmentally friendly, but also cost friendly, getting rid of infield power generation. But on the frac side and the drilling rig side, moving rigs and frac fleets to electrification would help lower costs on the capital side, but also then lower our combustion percentage of Scope 1 emissions. Operator : Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : I guess places and cues are directly correlated with the commentary around your variable dividend. Thanks for getting me on this morning. It's good to talk to you, Travis. Travis, I got to hit this right up-front. Look, if you -- how can you say you think your stock is undervalued, but you're not prepared to buy it? Variable dividends take cash off the balance sheet. They don't get capitalized in the business, which is a finite inventory. How do you expect the market to pay you for a variable dividend? Just, to me, in this business, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I'd just love your perspective. Travis Stice : Yes, Doug, listen, we've tried to outline exactly our thoughts on the rationale behind all of those things. My comments on the stock price is really a function of what I can control and not control, and I can't control the actual market, what the stock is -- what the actual stock price is. We try to be very disciplined and we are very disciplined in the calculus we use to buy anything, whether it's our stock, whether it's acquisitions or whether it's making drill well decisions. And I've tried to outline the mid-cycle oil price of $60 a barrel. I think that could change as we continue to accumulate free cash. Mid-stock oil price won't change, but our ability to buy more shares back will change, but we made a commitment to distribute at least 50% of our free cash flow and other than [ordinate] on the balance sheet, which we said we're not going to do, we're going to hard that commitment and return at least 50%. Douglas Leggate : Yes. I understand completely the rationale. It's an intellectual debate, perhaps, but equity volatility correlates with balance sheet structure. So EOG, Pioneer, some of your other peers are choosing to have net debt zero. So we'll carry on the debate. I want to ask about the -- a more specific question to the current commodity environment and how it's impacting your cash flow outlook, specifically, cash taxes, so this might be for Kaes. We've got a much higher gas price, obviously. We've got a backwardated curve, obviously. I assume that's accelerating the inflection in when you get to a full cash tax position. So if you can just give us an idea what you see happening in that regard? And I'll leave it there. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Doug. We raised our cash tax percentage this quarter because we weren't running $100 oil in our initial guidance in February. There's still some protection this year. We do have about $1.5 billion of NOLs that will protect us next year. So we won't be a full cash taxpayer next year in '2023. Some were NOLs that got pushed out, couldn't use it this year, so we've got to use it next year. And then commodity prices stay where they are. Full cash taxpayer by 2024. Douglas Leggate : So just to be clear, even with the forward curve case, you're still good through the end of next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean partially, right? I think our protection will decrease next year, but there will be some protection and then full cash tax payer in 2024. Operator : Our next question is from Leo Mariani from KeyBanc. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the inflation commentary here. Just wanted to kind of clarify sort of what I heard. It sounds like you'll have all your equipment here for your 2022 program. But just wanted to get a sense if generally, the prices for the big ticket items on the service side are locked in for 2022? Or perhaps could you see, I'll just call it some inflationary risk in the CapEx maybe in the second half? And then as we look to 2023, is that where you think that inflation could be maybe a larger problem if commodity prices are well bid later this year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, it really depends, right? I mean it depends on what happens in the situation with Russia and Ukraine as it relates to pipe costs, right? We thought pipe costs were going to come down in the back half of the year. It doesn't look like that's going to happen this year. It might happen next year. I mean I think there's a little push/pull, Leo, with this business tends to sort out supply chain issues over time. And as commodity prices stay stronger for longer, some of the tightness will get sorted out. So certainly, I'm not going to make a prediction that 2023 inflation is going to be as much as 2022, but we're certainly seeing inflationary pressures across all the big ticket items right now. And some of that pricing for the big ticket items is incentivizing new builds, which tends to lower prices. So I think there's a little bit of push/pull. Jury's still out on 2023. Travis Stice : Look, we will be affected by inflation, no 2 ways about it. But the bet that we've always made here internally is that we will be affected the least of anyone else because of our efficient operations. And you see it in the first quarter of this year, we were all affected by the same inflation, and we were at the low end of our CapEx guide for the quarter. Recognizing that's going to be a challenge to continue that performance, I still bet on our organization to deliver. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And certainly, I can see that from where you came out in 1Q on CapEx. And it looks like on the second quarter CapEx guidance, you seem equally confident that you can kind of keep the costs under control. So is this something that could maybe creep up more in the second half this year? Or do you kind of have rigs and crews and pipe locked in here in '22? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think we feel really good about the budget. Obviously, we're on pace for the low end. I think that's going to be tough, but we feel really good about this year's budget. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. I think first is for Kaes. In the cash tax, I just want to confirm in the accounting that you guys have done. You will estimate for the full year what is the cash tax rate and then you apply the same tax rate in each quarter roughly, flat on that and not necessarily based on saying that later in the year that you may have already used some more on the NOL so you will have a higher cash tax. And also then, if we assume, let's say, call it an average $100 WTI price for next year, I assume the cash tax rate would be higher. Any rough guidance that you can give? That's the first question. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I'll take the second part first. Certainly, the cash tax guidance would be higher next year if we have these commodity prices. I think it's basically pretty close to a full cash taxpayer outside of $1.8 billion of protection. And then second, I think your question related to when does the cash exit the system for cash taxes. And we'll be making payments, our first payment in June for the first half of the year and then quarterly thereafter now that we're heading to cash tax land. Paul Cheng : And yes. So is the cash tax rate, say, for the year would be about the same or that they still have quite a fluctuation? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, there's no fluctuation. So our burden in Q2 is expected to be higher than our burden was in Q1. It's just that the cash is going to leave the system in Q2. Paul Cheng : I see. Okay. And the second question is that for this year, it looks like from equipment availability and also a lot in the service price, you guys already done quite a lot. For next year, any kind of rough percentage you can provide how much of your service for CapEx or equipment that you already locked in with a debt price or that is 100% subject to the market conditions at this point? Kaes Van' t Hof : I would say most of it is subject to market conditions. We did -- we talked about the e-fleet, we signed a deal with Halliburton. That price is fixed and our sand price is fixed. So the rest is going to fluctuate, and we'll see where the market goes over the next few months. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter '22 Conference Call. During our call, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements related to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC.  In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.  I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by highlighting our second quarter performance. We once again delivered operationally, producing over 221,000 barrels of oil per day, near the high end of our quarterly guidance range. Our discretionary cash flow or operating cash flow before working capital changes totaled $1.8 billion, up 27% quarter-over-quarter, setting a new high for the company. This increase was primarily due to a favorable backdrop -- macro backdrop as well as improvement to our realized pricing as hedges put on last year continue to roll off. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, up 35% quarter-over-quarter. We will return 63% of this free cash flow to our shareholders, well in excess of our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow. This return is made up of our growing and sustainable base dividend, opportunistic share repurchases and a robust variable dividend.  Our annual base dividend is now $3 per share or $0.75 per quarter, representing a 7.1% increase from the company's previous annual base dividend of $2.80 per share or $0.70 per quarter. As previously announced, the Board elected to keep our total dividend per share flat quarter-over-quarter at $3.05, which is comprised of the 75% base dividend and a $2.30 variable dividend. This puts our total annualized 2Q dividend yield of nearly 10%. Additionally, we took advantage of market volatility and repurchased nearly 2.4 million shares during the quarter at an average price of a little over $127 a share for a total cost of approximately $303 million. We believe our opportunistic, disciplined approach to our repurchase program brings the most value forward for our shareholders and continues to give us the flexibility to use either our variable dividend, buybacks, or as has been the case so far in 2022, a combination of both to hit or exceed our returns target. As we move into the second half of the year, it's hard to ignore the amount of free cash flow we expect to generate, around $2.5 billion of current strip pricing. In June, we announced an increase in our capital returns commitment target, moving it up from 50% to at least 75% of free cash flow beginning in the third quarter. At 75%, that's over $1.8 billion return to shareholders or well north of $10 per share in just 2 quarters, for a total annualized return yield of approximately 17%.  This robust free cash flow profile led the Board to double the size of our buyback program from $2 billion to $4 billion, giving us ample running room to be opportunistic in the equity markets. Since the program was initiated in the third quarter of last year, we've repurchased over 8.3 million shares at an average price of $113 a share for a total cost of approximately $940 million. This includes 1.8 million of shares we've already repurchased in the third quarter for a total of $200 million at an average price of $113.70 a share. Our confidence to increase our return through payout is rooted in the strength of our balance sheet. During the second quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $337 million in Diamondback senior notes at an average cost of 95.4% of par for a total of $322 million. We focused on our debt coming due over the next 10 years, significantly lowering our maturity towers, while taking advantage of the volatile debt market.  We also recently redeemed $45 million in legacy Energen and QEP notes due 2022 at par. As a result, our balance sheet is stronger today than ever before. Our annualized net debt-to-EBITDA is under 0.7x, and we continue to improve our leverage profile with net debt decreasing by $267 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. These debt reduction efforts have helped decrease our interest expense by 25% year-over-year, offsetting higher production taxes and lifting costs and helping push our unhedged realized cash margin this quarter to more than 83%, a company record.  Moving to the operations side of the business. The environment in the Permian continues to be challenged. However, we continue to focus on how we can mitigate the inflationary pressures we're seeing across nearly all facets of the business by lowering the variable pieces of our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to keep the high end of our capital guidance range flat at $1.9 billion. We do not anticipate any future changes. Yet we still haven't been able to offset all of the fixed pricing increases we've seen, which is why we've moved up our third quarter capital range to $470 million to $510 million, up from our capital spend of $468 million this quarter. This takes into account the roughly 10% cost increase we expect on the frac side, which is made up of increases in the cost of horsepower, wireline services and fuel.  On the drilling side of the business, we're seeing a similar level of pricing increases, particularly from day rates, casing and cement. In the back half of this year, we plan to operate approximately 12 drilling rigs and 3 frac crews. As we mentioned last quarter, we've partnered with Halliburton to secure our first e-fleet frac crew, which will run in our Martin County acreage off power generated from a central location and delivered via existing lines, not only reducing our Scope 1 emissions profile, but also lowering our completion costs as a result of fuel savings and improved operational efficiency.  We expect this fleet to be operational early in the fourth quarter and it will simply be swapped in for 1 of our existing Halliburton crews. Earlier this month, we continue to lean into this technology and secured our second e-fleet crew. This crew will be operational in the first quarter of 2023 and is expected to further reduce costs and decrease our environmental footprint. It will also replace 1 of our existing crews. On the drilling side, we currently have 1 drilling rig running offline power in the Delaware Basin with 2 more electric rigs expected in 2023. Just as we're seeing on the completion side, the electrification of our drilling fleet has multiple benefits. Additionally, we're utilizing sputter and intermediate rigs to take advantage of lower pricing as compared to the rest of our drilling fleet, and are exploring downsize and surface casing size, intermediate hole size to improve our drilling efficiencies, pushing Diamondback even further down the cost curve.  Lastly, we continue to work to earn our social and environmental license to operate. Part of this is our commitment to provide quarterly disclosures that detail our progress towards our environmental goals. We are proud of how we have performed so far this year when looking at multiple metrics, including recycling nearly 40% of our produced water and keeping our total recordable incident level at multiyear lows. However, flaring continues to be an issue. We are diligently working with our gathering partners to build in redundancy, accelerate plant turnarounds and meet the takeaway needs of our current development plan. We remain committed to ending routine flaring by 2025 and are confident in our ability to achieve that goal.  We've also spent hundreds of millions of dollars to lower our emissions profile by building pipelines and electrifying our production fields. These projects have lowered our costs to date, but due to the increase in the cost of power across the state of Texas, we have had to move our lease operating expense guidance range up by $0.50 a barrel at $4.50 to $5 a barrel. Even with this move, we continue to be the low-cost Permian operator and build on a long track record of cost control.  The second quarter was a record quarter for the company. We delivered on our production guidance, kept costs in line and distributed over 63% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. We are well positioned to build off this momentum and are excited to begin returning at least 75% of our free cash flow to our shareholders this quarter. We expect this industry-leading cash returns program and our best-in-class operational machine to continue to deliver differentiated results for our shareholders.  With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Neal Dingmann : My first question is somewhat on shareholder returns. Specifically, I think on your conference call a year ago looked and, Travis, I think you stated that as you looked at back then at supply and demand fundamentals. You said, I think, suggest that oil supply was still purposely been withheld in the market, driving your call to not grow production. So I'm wondering when you look at today, do you still believe that's the overall case of worldwide fundamentals or specifically supply? And does that still drive -- is that still your primary decision -- your primary driver of your decision for the no growth? Or is this more based on investor request? Travis Stice : Well, certainly, as we look into 2023, I think it's a little premature to do much forecasting into 2023. But I can tell you kind of our base case is looking at something at the same activity level, probably generating something in the low single digits in terms of the growth rate. But again, it's more of an output. But I think what you specifically asked about the call last year, I think I highlighted really 3 things and then subsequently added a fourth, and that was demand at pre-COVID levels. We wanted to see 5-year inventory levels somewhere returning to the 5-year average. We still had a question about OPEC capacity. And the one I added subsequent to our call was the administration continuing to embark uncertainty into our capital allocation process across the industry.  And so certainly 3 of the 4 of those have been answered today, Neal. There's still a lot of administration led uncertainty, both in policy actions and rhetoric. But the other ones certainly appear to be answered. So I think as the industry starts to contribute towards more focus on 2023, I think you'll still be governed primarily by the shareholders who own the companies. But I do think you'll start to see a little bit of growth in the industry as we look into next year. Neal Dingmann : Great. Great response. Then my second question really, I would say is on the notable capital spend discipline that you guys continue to have. As many others we've already heard about, continue to increase their cost despite them previously saying that they were locked in. So I'm just wondering, going forward, would you all consider any type of, I don't know, like a more vertical integration or any other new strategy, will the focus remain more or less on the same as working with vendors and just the efficient execution? Travis Stice : Well, Neal, I think we've been pretty successful with the existing model. We'll always look at seeing what ways we can ensure lower execution cost. We were a little bit plummet in the first quarter with all the commentary about locked in prices and then subsequently followed with CapEx raises. And that's just not the way that we typically try to communicate what our execution focus is.  But I do want to -- I don't know I have a lot of employees listening in the call this morning. And look, I want to give a shout out to our organization for our ability to continue to manage costs in an inflationary environment. Again, about a year ago, Neal, we were talking about how you separate winners and losers in an inflationary environment. It's always those that can control costs. And while we've taken our look on the fixed cost side of an AP ledger, we've done a really remarkable job on the variable cost, and I look for our organization to continue to lean into that in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : First question is around capital returns. And you did increase the share repurchase authorization to $4 billion from $2 billion previously. It looks like you've been leaning a little bit more into the repurchase with the pullback in the stock. So if you just talk about your framework around variable dividend versus repurchases? And how you're thinking about being countercyclical with how you deploy your share repurchases? Travis Stice : Well, we certainly think that there's a lot of value in our existing stock price. And we think that, that oil and public equity stocks is really undervalued right now. And so the 2 data points that you mentioned, I think, are good indicators of future behaviors. The first being, we spent about $500 million in the last 2 to 3 months repurchasing shares. And the Board just essentially doubled our authorization up to $4 billion. So the base dividend still remains sacred, sustainable and growing followed by this environment share repurchases. And then as we committed to a month ago, we'll make up the difference and keep our shareholders hold by returning at least 75% of free cash flow. Neil Mehta : Yes. And then would love your perspective on the M&A outlook. We know that you've been active over the last couple of years. But is it fair to assume that given that you're prioritizing share repurchases at this point, do you think that's a better investment than third-party M&A? Travis Stice : Yes, certainly, Neil, that's the behavior we're demonstrating in. As I just iterated, just to emphasize all in the public markets is really cheaper in the private markets, and I think there continues to be a wide gap between those 2 points. And I think you're also seeing stalled or failed processes as well, which again indicates a spread between bid and ask. So right now, the greatest return for our shareholders is leaning into our repurchase program. Operator : And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : Maybe just a follow-up to Neil's question, is how do you think about your process to engage in portfolio renewal in this kind of backdrop and perhaps a little bit more color, it looks like you had about $85 million of property acquisitions in the cash flow statement. I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit of detail on that? And I think on a year-to-date basis, that takes you just under $400 million of property acquisitions. Travis Stice : Yes. Arun, the big deal is obviously in Q1, $230 million deal. We do capitalize a little G&A and interest which flows through that number, so it's not all property acquisitions. But a couple of things that we do on the property side, it's just the typical blocking and tackling, netting up. We give our land teams the directive that we'd rather drill 100% working interest wells across the board. And so they're always working to net up and block and tackle, but nothing of significance purchased in Q2. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : And look around being having boots on the ground here in Midland, I think all of our shareholders expect me and us to be in the deal flow at all times. But that just means we look at things coming across the desk, but I go back to say, look at what our behaviors are and the separation between public and private expectations on value. And that's -- I think that's the best way to think about what our forward plans are. Arun Jayaram : Okay. And just my follow-up is, you guys had really, really strong oil price realizations in the quarter. I was wondering if you could just remind us about your mix between getting waterborne crude pricing versus, call it, a Midland type of benchmark? Travis Stice : Yes. So we have all of our oil on pipes going to the Gulf Coast. A 1/3 of it going to Houston, getting MEH pricing, 2/3 going to Corpus getting Brent pricing. And so we've been the beneficiary of these water Brent WTI spread. We have a little bit of exposure to the Midland market, we also have the ability to kind of flex that to the Gulf Coast with the space that we have. And so the sell-off in WTI versus Brent has resulted in really good oil realizations. No guarantees that it's going to continue forever. But that kind of fits the insurance policy that we put in place to invest in these pipelines and get our barrels to the most liquid markets. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Hanold from RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : Could you all give us some view on what you all are seeing on leading edge inflation? And if you can give us a sense of what kind of savings you guys expect from the e-fracs versus a regular frac crew? I mean, how meaningful is that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Scott, good question. I would say, generally, we took up CapEx on the low end and took up our average well cost estimate for the year. I would say probably today, we're probably up 15% today from the beginning of the year. We'll probably exit a little higher than that. So probably 15% year-over-year well cost increases, but what the ops team is doing is not taking every phone call and just increasing prices. We're trying to do some things to be more efficient. You mentioned the e-fleet, Travis just mentioned in his opening remarks that we're going to have a second e-fleet coming in early next year. That saves money, not just on the horsepower piece, but on the fuel piece. These will be connected to line power and the back end of a gas plant with burning dry gas in the Permian.  So while gas prices have gone up, they certainly haven't gone up as much as diesel. I would say we'd probably save 50-ish a foot with that -- $50 a foot with that e-fleet. A couple of other things we are doing on top of that, we are adding some preset rigs to replace some big rigs as those preset rigs cost a lot less with these big pads and long cycle investments. We have that ability to do so. Our team is also getting really smart on casing design, cement design, wherever we can pick up pennies that's just our stock in trade. Scott Hanold : A lot of pennies there you're picking up. Good to hear that. And as a follow-up, and I'm going to kind of belabor the point on shareholder returns. And I know you all have done pretty well with executing your flexible plan. But the bottom line is right now, it appears that your stock is trading at a discount to peers. I mean it looks pretty evident. And like how do you all think about like what the best way to bridge that gap is? And like what can you do to kind of force the issue to get your valuation more in line with peers or where you think it should be? Travis Stice : Scott, when I talk to our Board and communicate what I think the success indicators are, there's really five. Three of them were foundational that led us to success in the first 10 years. And I think the two that I've added are going to be foundational for the next 10 years. But the three that we built the company on our execution, low-cost operations and transparency. And we've been very successful at differentiating ourselves with those. The two that have recently been added are capital return and decarbonization. And on the capital return, we're now -- our yield is peer-leading. We're competitive on all forms of shareholder return measures. And the last one is decarbonization, and not only in our disclosure, but also in our performance.  And look, those are the five things that we'd sell at. And you can ask us questions about any one of those five, we can articulate chapter verse why those are successful -- why we're successful with those. And while you pointed out a dislocation in stock, we believe fundamentally that we continue to do the right thing for our shareholders to generate the greatest value. And it -- and we believe we're running this company not just for a quarter but for the next 10 years and longer. Operator : And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate the color today. Maybe if I could ask one on just CapEx. In 2022, I think you all forecasted about 12% of your total budget going towards non-D&C. Is that a good contribution as we think about '23 and '24? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Good question, David. I think generally, if you look at our past history, we kind of whenever a deal happens the next year, infrastructure and midstream is 10% to 15%, getting down to kind of 7% to 8% of total capital in that years. I certainly expect us to be closer to 7% to 8% of total capital in 2024 with a step-down next year in 2023. I think the only wrinkle is we are all us and our peers are all spending a lot of money on environmental cleanup. And so that's probably $30 million to $40 extra million a year that wasn't in the budget in 2017 or 2018. It's necessary dollars, but generally, I'd expect our midstream infrastructure budgets to come down next year and into '24, probably a step change down to 7% or 8% in a couple of years. David Deckelbaum : And then maybe just as a follow-up. Obviously, the 3Q CapEx, 4Q CapEx is going to be -- is going to follow with activity with 3Q being higher than 4Q. As we think about next year, though, I think the expectation is that you guys would still be in that sort of 270, 290 wells, 12 rigs, a few frac crews. Is that $460 million or so implied guide for 4Q? Is that $460 million to $500 million range, like a reasonable run rate to think about '23? Or are there explicit reasons why you would want us to be guided away from that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I mean I think it's just too early to talk '23 inflation. I'm certainly kind of in the camp that we're not willing to continue to concede margin expansion on the service side perpetually. So we're going to see where things shake out over the next 6 months. Like we said earlier in the call, there are some things we are doing to increase efficiencies and lower costs. I would just say, generally, I think you're right on activity going into 2023. I can't -- I'm not going to comment yet on some respects and where things head particularly with some of the stuff that's out of our control like steel continuing to go up in price. David Deckelbaum : The only inflation I'm making then there's CapEx per share. Operator : And our next question comes from David Whitfield from Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on your quarter end update. With my first question, I wanted to focus on your operational efficiency. Would it be safe to assume the improvement you experienced in your drilling and completion efficiency metrics over the last couple of years has at least plateaued as a result of service tightness and the dilution of experienced crews? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Derrick, I think that's a fair statement. Certainly, the business has gotten a lot harder to operate and execute this year. It's on us though to make sure we have the right supervision in the field to make sure green hands are trained up quickly. It's something that we are seeing. We do spend a lot of money near the wellhead to make sure our supervision oversees what's going on in the field. But then there's a couple of other things that kind of go the other way, right? So the spud rigs that we're putting in place, they drill a little slower, but they cost half as much as the big rigs. So I think generally, we kind of hit the efficient frontier on days of TD this year, but now we're doing some things that might slow things down, but spend less money per well. Derrick Whitfield : That makes complete sense. And as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on the Inflation Reduction Act, which could be voted on this week focusing on the minimum tax and methane fee components. Could you speak to the implications for Diamondback and the industry in general? It seems at a minimum from our perspective that the one rare case that gets Diamondback would be minimized with the 15% minimum tax stipulation. Travis Stice : Derrick, the methane fee tax is one thing that we've looked at. And because of the dollars we've spent over the last 3 years really reducing our methane emissions that doesn't appear as we understand it to be a needle mover for Diamondback. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. And then on the tax side, we're pretty low on NOL protection. So if the strip holds, we have about $1 billion of protection next year, we would be above the 15% minimum that's being proposed. So I think generally moving towards a full taxpaying entity at Diamondback which mitigates the impact to us. Certainly, if we're in a different commodity price environment, it might be a different story. But in this environment, we're headed towards full cash taxes in 2024. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question is maybe hitting on the balance sheet a little bit. So you had about $21 million of stand-alone cash at the end of the quarter, and that reflects really getting after paying off those notes early and at a very nice discount. That's great. What's the sequencing of further debt reduction that you mentioned? And do you have an updated view on your target cash balance? We're essentially kind of back in to how much potential upside there could be to exceeding the 75% minimum return? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Jeanine, good question. With the rate review we expected to close at the end of August, we'll have to pay off that revolver at close. It's about a $200 million revolver that we'll expect to pay with -- down with cash. We also want to take out the Rattler notes, $500 million notes next. There are some reporting requirements with those notes if they continue to stay out there. So I think those 2 items are certainly the priorities, and we probably expect to be in a position to have those taken out by the next time on the phone here. And then I think after that, it goes back to being selective with the other outstanding notes. You'll note that we didn't touch the 2 30-year tranches that we have out there, but we did take down some of our 29 and 31 opportunistically with a discount. But generally, the Rattler notes and Rattler revolvers coming out next and then we'll be more prudent with the rest. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. And then maybe a quick one on operations. I think in the past, you mentioned running 3 simul-frac crews and then potentially utilizing a spot crew. And then in your prepared remarks, I think I heard you mention just running 3 frac crews. So just wondering if I'm remembering those 2 things correctly? And have you been able to maybe drop that spot crew due to efficiencies? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. So the 3 simul-frac crews are going to run consistently throughout the whole year. And those 3 have been going this year and they'll be the baseline for next year. We did have a spot crew running for part of Q2 -- spot crew again until probably the end of this year. We try to string together enough pads to make that spot crew cost competitive. And I don't know, Danny, you want to add anything on the spot crew? Daniel Wesson : No. I think the 3 simul-frac crews will do about 80% to 90% of our planned well activity and then the remaining 10% to 20%, we have to handle with an additional crew. We usually try to block it up and get a dedicated line of work for a crew for a period of time and then let it go and bring it back for the next group of wells. Operator : And our next question comes from Nicholas Pope from Seaport Research. Nicholas Pope : I had a quick question on kind of the updated CapEx guidance. Most -- the increase was all on the drilling side without much kind of change in kind of expected activity. But no real change in the other components, the midstream environmental infrastructure components. So I was kind of curious, are you -- what kind of inflation you're seeing on there? Are you expecting kind of the same amount of activity on those nondrilling, noncompletion components? Or is that just a little bit more fixed with project-type work? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. It's definitely a little more fixed with project-type work. There is some inflation in those budgets, but that was already somewhat baked in. On the midstream side, in particular, the big bulk items is buying a lot of pipe, and we pre-bought a lot of that. So we knew where that was going to sit on the cost side. On the infrastructure and our environmental side, it's not necessarily a change in plan. As you mentioned, it's just a few inflationary items around the edges, but it's nothing to the extent of what we're seeing on the drilling and completion side when it comes to inflation. Nicholas Pope : Got it. I appreciate that. And as you kind of look at kind of progressing towards completion of the midstream, the Rattler kind of acquisition. Is there any anticipation of any real change in operations? Or I guess, how much kind of third-party is even a part of Rattler at this point in terms of operation? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. That's a great question, too. Nothing is going to change operationally. And we still like the midstream business. We still like what it does for our consolidated margins. We just felt that it didn't need to be a separate public entity, and so we're able to buy that back in and still run a midstream business that we own 100%. I will say the team has done a good job seeking out third-party opportunities. I wouldn't say it's our core business, but we'll have some real cash flow coming in from third parties given the amount of assets we have on the ground on the midstream side. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I hate to go back to the capital return question, but just mostly you will issue a bunch of shares. I was just wondering how we should think about split between the variable and the stepped-up buyback program as you go forward? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Doug, you were a little mixed on that. I couldn't hear you pretty well, but I think I got the gist of it. I think generally, we are going to be very aggressive on the buyback here in Q3 given where the stock is, and where we continue to generate free cash above mid-cycle prices. So already expensed $200 million quarter-to-date. Generally, if you kind of take street numbers and keep our base dividend flat in Q3, we could probably spend another $650 million on buybacks this quarter. So if the stock stays where it is and well stays where it is, we're going to be very, very aggressive on that buyback, which is why the Board signified the confidence in increasing that authorization to $4 billion. Doug Leggate : Okay. So sorry to press on this point, Travis, and I apologize for my line, but is there a more formulaic way we can think about -- I mean, are we still looking at a substantial variable in the second half of this year? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : None of these prices, Doug, if the stock price stays where it is today, all that cash is going to go towards reducing the share count. Doug Leggate : Great. That's what I was looking for. My follow-up is just a quick one on going back to the A&D very quickly. Can you clarify, as your understanding is today, do IDCs and I guess, NOL is not such a big deal for you guys, but in IDC specifically, do they still qualify as an offset to the A&D in your view? Any color you can offer in your interpretation of that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think our interpretation is they still do. Unfortunately, IDCs have become such a small part of the cash flow stream that they're not impacting things much. So that's our understanding today. But you never know if politicians, anything can happen. Operator : And our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I wanted to ask just a follow-up on some of the thoughts around return on capital. Travis, you talked about conversations with the Board how to make Diamondback competitive relative to its peers. You've seen the evolution of what you guys had promised last year, 50% of 2022's free cash return to shareholders, the rest retiring debt. You've increased it to 75%, you just increased the buyback. I guess when you talk to the Board now about the return on capital programs, are there explicit targets that you're thinking about when you're putting on the outline around the buyback? And how did you come to this amount? Are you trying to intentionally show that Diamondback can retire 10% of its market cap plus every year? Is that -- are those explicit goals now? Or are these more coincidental based on the free cash is today? Travis Stice : Yes. Those are -- those -- we don't have specific goals that are articulated in the way that you just asked that question. We simply look at the value that we believe the inherent value of the stock versus where it's trading at. And we want to demonstratively move into repurchases when we think there's a big location like we see in today's market. And as we go forward in time, maybe that changes. But as it sits today, as Kaes just outlined with the previous caller, we believe that there's still a lot of value in the stock. Operator : And our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio from Mizuho Group. Vincent Lovaglio : Given the scale of free cash flow generation, I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about potential investment in future offtake, particularly on the gas side and kind of connecting that gas molecule to Gulf Coast, and ultimately, hopefully, international markets? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes, Vin, good question. I think just generally, while we are a pretty significant gas producer now at this point, we don't have a lot of control over the molecule. Diamondback has grown through acquisition over the years and with those acquisitions come dedications, and most of those dedications don't come on taking kind rights. So we're certainly doing as much as we possibly can to incentivize pipeline development, getting molecules to the Gulf Coast. We did commit to the Woodford pipeline. We'll have about 1/3 of our gas on that. But generally, you have to have control of that molecule to incentivize development, and we don't have much more beyond that today. Vincent Lovaglio : Got it. And then I just want to go back to the e-fleets. They seem like kind of a no-brainer at this point in time. I'm just wondering, if there were any changes in planning or any hurdles that you guys kind of have to get through before broader e-fleet adoption? Or is it really just kind of securing that line power? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Well, it's really about the quality of the fleet and what you're signing up for. I think what Halliburton has put together is truly an unique product. We're going to have some form of battery storage attached to that e-fleet so that you're very efficient with the use of natural gas and electricity when that fleet is working. So you do need a pretty big acreage blocks, you need large pads like we have ahead of us, and you need a long-term commitment with a business partner like Halliburton. So I think that -- we checked all those boxes. We feel very good about the e-fleet that's coming on in September, so good that we signed up for a second one. So 2/3 of our simul-frac fleets will be e-fleets with Halliburton. And like you said, it's pretty obvious when the economic and environmental advantages sync up, that's a no-brainer for us. And we're looking forward to getting our first one in the field here in a month. Operator : And our next question comes from Leo Mariani from MKM Partners. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to clarify a couple of things that I heard on the call here. So in terms of the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard the numbers right. Did you guys say that you could do an additional $650 million in 3Q alone on top of the $200 million you already announced? I just want to make sure I heard that number right. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Leo taking street numbers and multiply it by 75%, taking out the $200 million we spent quarter-to-date and taking out the $0.75 a share base dividend, and that's your math on buybacks for the quarter. And that's something we look at every day. I mean we have our team rerun the model on a weekly basis to figure out how much cash we're going to have in the quarter to buy back shares when there's this much of a dislocation between oil in the public market then oil in the ground. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the debt paydown. Obviously, you talked about paying off some of the Rattler debt here. Can you maybe just give us a little more color on the decision to kind of pay off some of the paying debt, which wasn't kind of due to the end of the decade, I guess some of the 29, 30s or whatnot in the second quarter. Look like you kind of elected to do that versus kind of pay the higher variable dividend because obviously, cash flows were up for the quarter. Just any more color kind of around the thinking there? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. It's a pretty unique opportunity where E&P has a ton of cash flow and bonds trading below par. And we saw that opportunity. Our Board saw with us and decided that buying back some debt well below par was a good use of capital and also exercise accelerates that deleveraging process to give us more confidence in the increased 75% of free cash flow going back to shareholders beginning in Q3. Leo Mariani : Okay. And just to clarify on the shareholder returns, you guys do not count debt pay down as a shareholder return, right? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : That's correct. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Two questions, please. Can you just remind us what is your hedging policy, if that's an official guidance in terms of what percentage that you want to hedge? Secondly, that with the rising recession period, how that impact your thought process in the 2023 budget in terms of the capital return, balance sheet management and all that? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the hedging policy, and I'll let Travis talk more macro about 2023. Just generally, we do buy puts for rainy days. So we've gone to the balance sheet is strengthened, we bought more and more puts around $50 to $55 Brent. In that situation, if we do go below $55 Brent, we're probably making capital decisions to slow down, but the balance sheet doesn't blow out. We can still pay our dividend and still generate free cash in that situation. So really protecting for a rainy day, trying to spend around $1.50 to $2 a barrel to buy those puts, and we want to be about 60% hedged going into a particular quarter. So if you look at our hedge book, about 60% hedged for Q3, going down to about 0% by Q2, Q3 of 2023. And we'll just continue to keep rolling that forward for rainy day insurance. Travis Stice : And Paul, the energy has typically been a pretty good hedge a bit offset historically. And as you look into 2023, regardless of how you define a recession, it looks like there will be recessionary impacts across our economy. But what's a little bit different this time is that the world today still appears to be chronically short physical barrels with not a lot of spare capacity to fill that gap. And so while we don't necessarily plan on anything other than in the future than our mid-cycle prospect, it looks to me like the macros -- the macro looks pretty positive for energy prices over the next couple of years, even in spite of what I know will be a recessionary impact. And look, if you do see some recessionary impacts, it will probably soften some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing today. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. I'd make one more point. That's the benefit of this new business model where we're not changing our plans for every $10, $20, $30 move in oil prices. There needs to be a $50 move in oil price lower before we discuss any change to our execution plan. And I think this level-loaded plan, level-loaded activity levels has allowed us to fight off the inflation bug a little better than most. And again, as Travis mentioned, there's no oil out there. Paul Cheng : Just curious that when you gentlemen kind of want to keep more cash balance if that's the increasing recession fee? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yes. Right now there is still cash. We certainly want to cash balance. The cash balance moves a lot right now and when you're generating $1 billion of revenue a month, if the cash balance fluctuates wildly throughout each month. I think generally, having a strong balance sheet, having some cash and having access to capital through a cycle is something us and the Board discuss on a monthly basis. And I think that also ties to where your maturity profile sits, right? So if we not only have less debt, but a longer duration maturity profile, that gives us confidence in our access to capital and our ability to generate cash, given that our cash flow breakeven is down in the mid-30s a barrel. Operator : And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again for everyone for participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact informations provided. Thank you.

Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. And before we start with my prepared remarks this morning, I want to encourage each of you to please take advantage of one of our greatest privileges we have as Americans, our freedom to elect our representatives. Please take the time off your busy schedules today to go vote, if you've not already done so. Welcome to Diamondback's third quarter earnings call. A Diamondback, we pride ourselves on our execution. Our commitment to being the lowest cost operator in the Permian Basin has and will continue to position us for success through the cycle. The third quarter was no exception. In the quarter, we produced over 224,000 barrels of oil per day and generated approximately $1.7 billion in operating cash flow. Our CapEx was once again within our guidance range, leading to free cash flow of nearly $1.2 billion. As we previously announced, we increased our return of capital commitment and stated that beginning this quarter, we would return at least 75% of free cash flow back to our shareholders, up from at least 50% previously. At 75%, total capital return was nearly $875 million, with dividends totaling $403 million or $2.26 per share. The remaining $472 million went towards our opportunistic share repurchase program, where we bought back nearly 4 million shares at an average price of approximately $120 a share. To date, we've spent approximately $1.2 billion of our $4 billion buyback authorization, repurchasing nearly 6% of our shares outstanding since September of last year when we initiated our program. In October, we announced the pending acquisition of the assets of FireBird Energy, a company with a large, contiguous position in the Midland Basin. We feel FireBird has right balance of cash flow and inventory and the acquisition is immediately accretive on all relevant per share financial metrics while providing a long runway of high-quality drilling opportunities. With over 350 locations, we expect to have well over a decade of run room at our projected one-rig development phase. In conjunction with the acquisition, we announced that we would sell at least $500 million of non-core assets by the year-end 2023, with net proceeds primarily used to pay down debt. Since then, we closed on a $155 million sale of non-core assets in the Delaware Basin, jump-starting our program and ensuring continuous improvement to our investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to pursue strategic divestitures, including the sale of certain assets within our Rattler portfolio, generating unrealized value for our shareholders. In closing, we know our business. We know we have some of the best inventory in the United States with our low-cost operational machine in place. We have the unique ability to generate significant repeatable returns through the drill bit for decades to come. In 2019, we began co-developing our primary targets. Since then, we've learned how to optimize our development patterns and spacing, and as a result, are seeing material improvement in well productivity over the past 36 months. In fact, our well performance this year is back at 2019 levels, when we were primarily targeting one-off wells in our -- zones, which while having great performance and economics and the potential to withstand significant components of our inventory, leading to material parent-child concerns down the line. Fortunately, we are well positioned for the future. We expect to close on the FireBird transaction at the end of November and slow the development pace on that asset from three rigs to one. We are working with our service providers to ensure that we have the most efficient and cost-effective personnel and equipment in place for next year, including the two e-fleet simul-frac crews we've secured from Halliburton, the first of which is already in the field and performing well. All of this will provide operational momentum as we move into 2023 we expect to deliver the same operational results you've come to expect from Diamondback. While we won't be giving detailed for the 2023 guidance today, we believe that we'll be able to generate low single-digit pro forma oil production growth next year by maintaining our current standalone activity levels plus the one additional FireBird rig. It's not easy to operate in this environment, but our size, scale and quality of the inventory uniquely position us to deliver differentiated results and create meaningful value for our shareholders. Before I open up for questions, I want to address all the Diamondback employees that are on the phone. At Diamondback, we've just celebrated our 10 years as a public company, growing from a $500 million market cap to almost $30 billion today. The people around me this morning and sometimes me individual get too much credit for the success. It's you, the men and women of Diamondback that deserve the credit. It's your pursuit of excellence, your desire to be the very best version of yourself, your dedication to integrity that is responsible for our success. It remains my privilege to represent you. Thank you for all that you do. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : Thanks. Good morning Travis and team. Travis, my first question is on your developmental strategy, specifically, could you all discuss if you have or will continue to develop, you mentioned, I think it's Slide 7, you've gone to the co-development, you all went there really, I think, before a lot of others did. And I'm just wondering, are you going to do that is that pretty much on all the assets included when you take over FireBird, and I'm just wondering the second part of that, are there parts of this process that you believe you still have an advantage over peers. It just seems to me when I'm looking at sort of margins in the perm, you all still are leading. So I'm just wondering, if there are some things you're doing when looking at that Slide 7 that you still think are leading as sort of the pack. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Neal, good question. This is Kaes. I think generally, we obviously had a tough earnings call at the end of 2019, when we made this shift to co-development. I think we learned very, very quickly from that as well as moving more of our capital to the Midland Basin. And I think just generally, the teams have done a really good job on not only spacing within each zone, but the intra-zonal spacing given that these zones talk to each other. And the result is better overall assets here over the last couple of years. So nothing is going to change there. I think we're going to keep co-developing. And in fact, in some ways, we'll end up doing some larger pads, and we even have prior given the amount of virgin rock we have in that sale of Robertson Ranch area that is kicking off in a real way right now. I think generally \u2013 on the other \u2013 on the other question, well costs are certainly the biggest advantage we have as a company at Diamondback, and that's a cultural thing from top to bottom. We're very focused on cost, very focused on keeping costs down in this inflationary environment. I think that gives us an advantage, particularly in looking at stuff like FireBird, right? FireBird we're going to co-develop a lot of zones up in the north at a low cost structure and that central position. There's opportunities for upside, if we bring the Wolfcamp B into the Lower Spraberry development. And that, I think the testament that we can drill them cheap, the returns make sense to compete for capital. Neal Dingmann : Yeah, it really sounds encouraging. Then turn to my second question, well, I guess, I'd call it the topic your and that's on shareholder return and capital allocation. Travis, for you or Kaes, I mean, do you see any scenario where you all would back off that 75% payout and maybe turn to more growth or something else? And then on the capital allocation, obviously, you all had a nice stock move. How do you feel about the buybacks versus it is? Travis Stice : Look, we've seen the volatility in the market that every quarter, we've had the opportunity to buy shares back. And when that opportunity presents itself, we'll do so aggressively. I think the key to any of those questions is the ability to generate free cash flow. And that's certainly what our focus is, and then maintaining the flexibility on how the return of that free cash flow gets prosecuted. I will say that in conversations with our long-only shareholders. A lot of those guys prefer to get the cash back. But again, we believe that we'll have opportunities to repurchase shares back. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. And then no change to the 35% of free cash flow, while it's certainly a restrictive amount of cash to be giving back to the equity holders, we feel that our balance sheet is in a position to be able to do that. And we're still going to reduce debt through non-core asset sales or free cash flow generation and our debt structure is significantly better than it has probably ever been in our company history. So generally, we feel that, it's time for our equity holders to get their cash back after this company has matured from a high-growth company to a high-returning company. Neal Dingmann : Yeah, I would agree. Your total shareholder return certainly speaks for itself. Thanks, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Neal. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning, team, and congrats on 10 years that pass by very fast. So, well done here, my first question is on 2023 capital spending and any early thoughts here as we bridge from your 2022 levels to next year? And talk about all the moving parts ranging from inflation activity? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Neil. I think while we're not ready to throw in the towel that well costs are going to keep going up next year, we do have some things coming our way from an efficiency perspective. But I'll kind of lay it out two ways. Based on the $1.9 billion that Diamondback is going to spend on capital this year, pre FireBird. I would assume we're probably up 10% to 15% from that number gone ahead if we had to make that decision today on well costs. I think another way to think about it is basically in Diamondback today is pre-FireBird at a $500 million run rate of capital, I would say, somewhere below 10% increase off of that makes sense. And then in both scenarios, adding the $250 million of CapEx for FireBird, we ran that deal on current well costs. So those current well costs are running through that the capital free cash flow numbers that we put in for that deal. So that's how we're thinking about it. I think certainly, there are some things that could go our way. Casing has been a massive headwind for us and for the industry. Midland Basin, casing is now $110 a foot, that is a huge number of -- on a fixed cost that we can't really control here. Neil Mehta : Okay. And then we'll look for a little more clarity, but that's a helpful starting point. And then Travis, a question for you is just on your outlook for US shale growth. I think a number of industry participants have been surprised by how flat the US production profile has looked here over the last several months. And so curious on your thoughts on shale maturity? And is the lack of growth that we're seeing relative to expectations a function of service bottlenecks, or is it a function of also asset maturity? Travis Stice : A lot to unpack in that question, Neal, but I think it's really all of the above. I think there is asset maturation. I think certainly, supply chain constraints are also limiting growth. I think for public companies, the continued discipline that we've all been demonstrating on shareholder returns versus a commitment to growth. I think all of those factors weigh into more of a muted production growth from US shale going forward. That said, out here in the Permian, I think we're still continuing to hit production records every month, somewhere close to 5.3 million to 5.5 million barrels a day. But that's going to be challenged to continue to grow that into the future. Do we have the assets out here? Yes, we do. But some of those other topical constraints that I mentioned are going to be impediments to efficient growth assume we'll probably see at higher commodity prices some people try to grow, but they're allocating capital if they're very trailing into of efficiency. So those also create headwinds as well for shareholders. Neil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, gentlemen. Kaes or Travis, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the evolution of your co-development strategy, which you shifted in 2019. You highlighted how your well productivity now has returned to 2017 levels. I wondered to see if maybe you could also maybe compare and contrast how Diamondback's development looks like relative to many of your peers, because you highlighted how you believe you're completing the most number of zones per pad in the Midland Basin? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, Arun, I'll focus more on what Diamondback is doing. We certainly do a lot of competitor analysis and learn a lot from our competitors on what to do and what not to do in the basin. So generally, we have a data analytics team that looks at inter-lateral and reserve spacing, and how many wells are completing per pad and per zone and how close the nearest well bore is. And our math tells us that we're finding a striking a good balance here between IRR and NPV. We may not have the highest oil per foot, but certainly spacing wells a little tighter, as well as co-developing more economic zones together and I expect that trend to continue to head our way. In some ways, these higher commodity prices bring more zones into the equation and maybe even one or two wells per zone. But generally, spacing has stayed fairly consistent here for the last couple of years. So credit to the team for looking at what we've done, what's gone well, what's gone poorly and adjusting accordingly. And I think we're set up now for a few years of very solid development, particularly in the Midland Basin side. Arun Jayaram : Great, great. And then maybe just my quick follow-up. As you guys have now started to develop some of the assets you bought from Guidon and QEP in Central Martin County, can you give us a sense of how the early wells have been trending? And what type of mix should we expect in Martin County on a go-forward basis over the next couple of years? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I mean, certainly, when we go back to that deal, we basically said we did these two deals to get better and not bigger. And I think that's proving out in the performance of the wells and the performance since then. We're just getting started in the main block. There's probably a 24-well pad coming on here in early 2023, and we'll continue to develop that sale in Robertson block very aggressively with probably a three-rig run rate until it's drilled up in three or four years. And that should drive the lion's share of operational performance. Not to be outdone by that, though, we have seen very good well results up in the Northwest portion of Martin County this year due to some adjustments on spacing and landing targets, and I'm proud to say certainly some of the shallower zones, Middle Spraberry has looked very, very good up there relative to prior expectations. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning all. Travis Stice : Hey, good morning Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Travis, with the understanding that you guys have limited exposure to Waha in 2023 and the recent weakness was really driven by maintenance. Could you speak to your macro views on gas ingress over the next few years? And how you plan to mitigate your exposure over time? Travis Stice : Yeah. Certainly, it's going to be tight. I'll let Kaes give some specifics on that. But I think gas takeaway is going to be talked really certainly most of next year, probably well into 2024 as well until we get some of the major pipes on. So we do think \u2013 we do opportunistic hedging, particularly against the \u2013 on the Waha side. And we've committed to some of these pipes that are help making sure we get gas not only that doesn't go to Waha, but goes directly to the Gulf Coast. Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah. I mean, basically, next year, two-third of our gas goes to Waha, and that's all been hedged today, actually hedged a while back. And the other third gets Gulf Coast exposure on the Whistler pipeline. And then as you think about 2024, we think there's going to be pockets of weakness in 2024, certainly easing in the back half of the year when the big pipe Matterhorn comes on, but it's going to be tight from now until then, because some of these expansions, yeah, there are 500 million a day expansion, but I think they're going to be full right away. Derrick Whitfield : Terrific. And as my follow-up, I wanted to focus on your operational efficiency. Given the improvements you've experienced in D&C efficiency metrics really over the last couple of years, most would expect efficiency to ply to due to the law of diminishing returns and the dilution of experienced crews. As you guys look forward in time, what are the levers you're hoping to pull to improve or at least maintain your operational efficiency? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah, a good question. I think the biggest thing that's going to help us next year from a cost perspective are the two Halliburton e-fleets that one has just started and one is picking up. I think generally, on the horsepower side, we get charged a little bit less. They make more margin on that particular piece of business. On top of that, we're not spending money on diesel, right? So we're fueling that fleet with cheap Waha gas for the next couple of years, and that could be anywhere from $10 to $15 a foot of savings depending on what the price of Waha is. And we just opened our first mobile mine or mini mine that's going to be right offset some of our Martin County position. So I think generally, while we're not drilling wells to TD faster than we were last year, we're still best in class in that area. Now, it's time to work on the other pieces of the cost equation as inflation heats up here. Travis Stice : Yeah. And Derrick, there's a lot of conversations always when you see activity levels increase in the Permian Basin about the impacts of the inexperienced or green hands, we call them. But I don't follow that line of thinking, because it's our job as supervisors of those activities to make sure that even the least experienced individual has the right supervision to perform this job not only safely, but efficiently. So they almost actually transfers not to the service companies, within experienced hands, it transfers to our operations organization and our field supervisors to make sure they can provide the oversight to prosecute our plans effectively, efficiently and safely. Derrick Whitfield : Great, update. Thanks for your time. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Thanks, everyone for taking my question today. Travis Stice : You\u2019re welcome, David. Good morning. David Deckelbaum : Good morning. I wanted to follow-up just on the $500 million non-core asset divestiture program, $155 million achieved already on some PDP. Travis, you highlighted in your prepared remarks, some of the Rattler assets. I kind of feel like Diamondback isn't getting credit for us. Should we think about that as representing the bulk of the remaining non-core targets? And could you give us a little bit more detail about the scope of that asset? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Yeah. I mean really, David, it's all value, right? But generally, internally, we see that an E&P business trades at 4, 5 times and a pipeline or a gathering system trades at 8 to 10 times. So it's logical for us, with us not getting any credit for it in our valuation to look at some of the JVs that we invested in alongside contributing volumes to those businesses over the last five years. And now, I think they're in kind of a harvest mode where it might make sense to sell, particularly given our buying of Rattler and renewed focus on the upstream business, which is what we're so good at. So, I won't commit to certain projects, but there are certainly some of our JVs were sitting on big wins, and you could expect us to try to monetize those appropriately over time. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate the color on that, and good luck with those. Maybe just a second one for me. I know we talked a lot about well productivity, but obviously, it's on that slide 7, you guys highlight continued well productivity improvements in the Midland Basin. I guess as we think about going into 2023, I think you guys have highlighted you'll continue to allocate more activity towards some of the virgin rock areas like Robertson Ranch. Also seems like the overall Midland productivity is benefiting from high grading into Martin and Midland. With FireBird, I guess you're putting one rig on there. I guess when you look out, how long does this mix be -- how long is this mix maintains with this sort of intense high-grading within Martin and Midland where we might expect that productivity per well or on a per foot basis to be sustained at these levels are perhaps improving? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean I think it's going to be around for a while, certainly longer than the market can see today, which I think is important, right? We have two well-timed deals in 2020 that that we're benefiting from today. I think generally, our job is to allocate capital to the best returning zones and projects first. So, we won't be able to keep this up forever. But I think as the shale cost curve goes up, which is likely to happen over the next decade, our job is to maintain a cost structure and an inventory that keeps us at the low end of that cost curve. And that's what we've built this business on. And I think we have both the inventory and definitely the cost structure to be able to keep ourselves at the low end of that cost curve longer. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. Thank you, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Kaes Van' t Hof : Good morning, Jeoffrey. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Just a couple for me on the FireBird acreage, in particular, a little bit on productivity, but also a bit on inventory. I saw in the deck that you highlighted some small results on that acreage. I just wanted to get your thoughts on if there are any potential implications there from an inventory standpoint? If you could maybe speak to how the locations you've spoken to, to this point that asset are distributed across the position? And secondly, what sort of upside you might contemplate in terms of inventory based on some of these results? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Jeoff great question. When we announced the deal, we got one with a lot of people, but we haven't been on a big call like this. We basically said the northern prospect, which you can see on slide 8 in our deck, competes for capital right away, and that's the game plan is to allocate that rig to that northern prospect for the first few years of the deal. I think generally, recent well results in the Central prospect would bring in the Wolfcamp A upside into co-development. We underwrote six across in the Lower Spraberry across that block, and that's what we paid for. But, recent well results of co-developing the LSE looked pretty promising today. We have some time to kind of test that out before full field development, but that's kind of the underwritten upside of the trade. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Got it. Thanks, guys. Travis Stice : Thank you Jeof, Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning Travis, Dan and Kaes. Thanks for taking my question Kaes Van' t Hof : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : First, question, maybe just going back to the 2022 guide. The updated guidance for wells drilled, it's now a little bit lower at 260 for the year versus 270 to 290 before, I think. Can you talk about what's driving that number lower now? And how that really impacts operational momentum into next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Jeanine, I won't say it interrupts operational momentum into next year because it's our job to not have those issues. We are running a couple of extra intermediate rigs today to get ahead of these large pads where the big rig follows. So I think the message is nothing to see here from operational momentum. That's what you expect us to do, and that's what we do best. Just -- I would just say, we probably completed a couple of more wells in the Delaware than we originally expected this year, and we ran probably one less rig than we thought for the year. So -- on the other side of the equation, we're completing probably 15 less wells than we went into the year expected to complete. So your capital efficiency is certainly looking good and momentum feels very good going into 2023. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Definitely, I stand out these days in E&P. Wonderful. Thank you for clarity. Maybe our second question is just a quick housekeeping one. In your prepared remarks on 2023, you talked about low single-digit growth on a year-over-year adjusted basis. What baseline oil number should we be using or assuming it's like 220 a day for legacy FANG, but we're not quite sure what to assume for FireBird since we only have commentary for 4Q, and that's only for like a month. So just a housekeeping question on that. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question. I think we did release 19,000 barrels of oil a day net for FireBird in 2023 and that is not changing. The base business FANG, we went into 2022 saying we're going to keep 220,000 barrels of oil a day flat. We've kind of outperformed that a little bit this year. But basically, you can take that 220, complete the same number of wells as we expected at the pre FireBird Diamondback level, and that should spit out a couple of percentage points of low single-digit growth. And then add that FireBird 19 on top of that, and nothing's changed here from our perspective. You think that what you expect us to do, be transparent and hit these numbers. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thanks, gentlemen. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Jeanine. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Tim Rezvan : Hi, good morning, folks. Some of my questions have been addressed. So I think I'll just ask one. Obviously, you opened the door a bit talking about election day today. And I'm just curious if you could talk about if either Diamondback or any of your industry trade groups have had any discussions with the Biden administration in DC about these perceived oil shortages in the US? And any context you can provide would be helpful. Travis Stice : Yes, certainly not specifically inside Diamondback. But yes, aggressively so with the trade organizations that Diamondback is a part of. At the federal level, API, APC we have a lot of sweat equity invested in both of those trade organizations that we lean in alongside all of our industry peers to provide some clear strategies into the White House and the current administration. So \u2013 and that will continue regardless of how the results of the elections turn out today. That's our advocacy arm, and we think it's important for our shareholders to be a dynamic part of that advocacy. Tim Rezvan : Okay. And then I guess the follow-up is, do you believe that anybody do you see is listening to the sort of the domestic group of producers? Travis Stice : Yeah, it certainly seems like the rhetoric has turned decidedly against the industry again in the lead up to these elections. We can only open pray for that our citizens continue to elect morally and ethically excellent representatives, so that we can send people to Washington, D.C. that do a will of the people. And Diamondback is going to continue to do our part like I said, through advocacy, both locally and at the state and federal level as we navigate this very difficult rhetoric that's being addressed or pointed at our industry. Tim Rezvan : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the comments. Travis Stice : You bet. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is Doug Leggate with Bank of America. John Abbott : Good morning. This is John Abbott for Doug Leggate. Again, thank you for taking our questions. Travis Stice : Hey, John. John Abbott : Our first question is on capital allocation. Approximately 80% of your CapEx is to the Midland this year, 20% to the Del, and you sort of look over a multiyear horizon. At what point would you anticipate that the Delaware would become a better or a larger percentage of your overall CapEx? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : Honestly, quite frankly, we look at all our inventory of keep that 80-20 steady for a long time. So I don't think there's any plans to change it. In some ways, with the FireBird acquisition, some more wells completed there will probably be closer to 85-15 Midland, Delaware. And I think the curves that we posted on slide 7 proved out that our Midland Basin is certainly top notch, and that's where we're going to be focused. John Abbott : Appreciate it. And then our second question is on sustainable free cash flow. So, the wells you're drilling this year are over 10,000 foot laterals. Looking at your slide, I think it's about two-thirds of your inventory is about 10,000 foot laterals while the one-third is less than that. So over a multiyear horizon, how do you think about your ability to sustain free cash flow? Kaes Van\u2019 t Hof : I think generally, we have a significant amount of long lateral development ahead of us. At some point, naturally, if we can't get trades done block up acreage, we're going to have to reduce our lateral lengths. But I think on the other hand, you have a lower decline production allowing you to maintain capital efficiency for a longer period of time. So we look at it every quarter, total inventory, total development. And as far as we can see, things look very good for Diamondback's capital efficiency for the next few years. John Abbott : Appreciate it, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis Stice : Thanks John. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Charles Meade : Good morning Travis, Kaes and the rest of the Diamondback group. Travis Stice : Hi. Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, I'd like to ask a question back to the FireBird asset. You guys laid out this view along the North-South-axis. But can you give us some of the, I guess, how the prospectivity changes West or -- East to West? And my understanding is, you're starting to approach or get up onto the Central Basin platform on -- particularly on the western side of that central prospect, and I think it even your Limelight prospect there. So, are there any promising puzzles you're working on, on that side, or is that something we should be thinking about for -- in the near future, or is that a project its way down the line? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah, good question. I don't think it's anything in the near-term. There certainly are some results further West that early time look promising. We didn't underwrite kind of two-mile buffer on the West side for LS prospectivity, but certainly did -- there's certainly some untapped upside with some Barnett and Woodford results nearby, including our Limelight prospects. So that play is getting a lot of attention. But at the end of the day, our investors expect us to underwrite what we're going to develop. And right now, that's all on unvalued upside, which technology and costs work out, it will be certainly prospective into the next decade when we get to drilling it. Travis Stice : And you'll see our development strategy, Charles, as we've moved to that central block, as Kaes laid out as kind of our Phase 2 drilling, but we'll start East and work West. And I think the two wells that are labeled E and F on slide 8 are good examples of what that early development scenario look like. While we didn't complete those wells, the results are really promising. And we're excited about them. But Phase 1 will be up to the North, which is very akin to our Spanish Trail development, and then we'll start on the East side of the central prospect and work our way to the West before you get up, as you pointed out, before you get to the Central Basin platform. Charles Meade : Guys that's good detail. Kaes, when I was listening if you answered, maybe think of a word, I don't think you've ever heard before. I was expecting you say something like that Western side is underwritten or something like that. But anyway, on underwritten, and then maybe just one more following up on this, FireBird deal and Travis in case. I think this is kind of whether we should think about this as a new mode or a pattern for you guys. As I look at the different pieces of your business where you're not committing to 75% cash return -- free cash return to shareholders. That leaves a smaller piece, the 25% piece available to fund the cash portion of any future A&D. And then we look at the FireBird deal, you guys -- it was -- it looks like a good deal. But equity was a big component of it. So is that something we should be thinking about for you guys? Is that as you're retaining less cash and equity is going to be a meaningful chunk of future A&D, or is the -- is that the wrong iteration? Kaes Van' t Hof : Well, I think generally, there's not a ton of A&D left to do in the basin, right? It certainly -- there's not random 200,000, 30,000 acre blocks in the middle of Martin County or Midland County that are available. So A&D is certainly evolving over the next couple of years in the Permian as consolidation continues. I think generally, with the 75-25 commitment to equity versus non-equity on cash returns that makes looking at deals even more -- put deals under the microscope, right? So in this deal, we're very focused on not levering up the balance sheet in a meaningful way because we work so hard to get the balance sheet where it is. And the sellers had an asset that was early in its development and believed in the upside and wanted to take Diamondback's stock to execute on that upside. It's not -- we're not giving up 10% of the company to these guys. They have a 3% position and hopefully, they're long-term happy shareholders. But I think we've used equity to grow this business for the last 10 years. And it's proven out to be the right way to fund deals. Charles Meade : Thanks for that details, Kaes. Appreciate it. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with MKM Partners. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. I wanted to jump back into kind of CapEx. Certainly, I noticed that CapEx has kind of been trending up a little bit in the last few quarters and into the fourth quarter guidance. I assume that's mainly inflation. I think your activity levels have been pretty flattish. Can you just provide any more color around the pace of inflation right now? I know you talked about tubulars continuing to sort of go up? Are you starting to sense that any other items are maybe starting to ease a little bit where they're not rising as quickly, and have you locked in any major portions of your 2023 budget at this point? And if so, can you provide some details on that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Leo, good question. I would say this is, kind of, why we're not looking to give 2023 guidance officially today because I think some things will come to us versus this year where everything just went up. We do have a couple of frac fleets locked in and the two fleets that we talked about. All of our sand is locked in with a large contract with a local provider. You know, the rigs, we continue to roll our rigs on a rolling 6-month basis. And while we're running 15 rigs today, I bet you 12 of them are different rigs that we're running this time next -- this time last year because of cost and efficiencies. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes to keep pushing well costs down or stopped them from going up, and that's what you'd expect us to do. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And I just wanted to ask a clarification question. I know it's too early for exact specifics on 2023. But if I heard you guys right, I mean, the base level thinking is, sort of, flattish year-over-year activity and then basically would just add in -- in FireBird, essentially. So the operated plan for this year, FireBird is relatively intact for next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : That's right. I think FireBird, we're going to drop a couple of rigs drop them down from three rigs to one rig, generate a little more free cash on that business and hit 19,000 net barrels a day of production. We forecasted for that business. I think we'll complete around 30 wells there. So you can basically take Diamondback base business from this year plus the 30 wells from FireBird plus the production that we laid out today to get an early look at 2023. Leo Mariani : Okay, Thanks, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Leo. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. So with that, I'll hand the call back over to CEO, Travis Stice, for any closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again for everyone to participate in today's call. If you've got any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Adam, go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2022 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and welcome to Diamondback's fourth quarter earnings call. 2022 was another great year for Diamondback. We successfully executed on our capital program, accelerated our return of capital plan and generated record cash flow. I'm very proud of all that we were able to accomplish and look forward to what I believe will be another strong year for the company. Looking back at last year, we produced over 223,000 barrels of oil per day, exceeding our production expectations. This is primarily the result of our well performance, which continues to trend in the right direction as our normalized oil production in the Midland Basin improved by 6% year-over-year and nearly 20% when compared to 2020. We continue to optimize our multi-zone co-development strategy, which we pivoted to prior to the pandemic by tweaking our frac designs, spacing assumptions and landing zones to maximize our returns.  On the operations side, we've also built out substantial water infrastructure, which allows us to implement simul-frac completions across our position. This type of completion is consistently more efficient than a traditional zipper frac design because we can complete approximately 80 wells per year with just one crew. When you add in the additional efficiencies we're seeing from our Halliburton e-fleet, our completion savings are approximately $50 a foot. Last year was not without its challenges from significant inflationary pressures, particularly with casing, equipment availability and weather-related downtime. However, our operational team did what it always does, deliver best-in-class execution. Our ability to hold our capital budget flat and stay within our original guidance range while also exceeding our production target is something you should expect from Diamondback as we push to deliver differentiated results quarter after quarter. Financially, we generated over $7 billion in EBITDA and $4.6 billion in free cash flow or nearly $26 per share, both records for the company. We made significant progress on our return of capital plan, increasing our cash return commitment in the middle of the year to return at least 75% of free cash flow to stockholders. In total, we returned 68% of our free cash flow in 2022, which equates to $3.1 billion through a combination of our base and variable dividend and share repurchase program, buying back nearly 8.7 million shares at an average price of $126 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. This represents 5% of our shares outstanding when we announced our program in September of 2021. An additional $2 billion was returned through our base and variable dividend with the total dividend growth of nearly 5x when compared to 2021. In total, we returned $11.31 per share in dividends.  In the fourth quarter alone, we returned over $860 million or $5.65 per share with a total dividend yield of nearly 9%. This included an increase to our annual base dividend of $0.20, now $3.20 per share annually or $0.80 per quarter, representing 54% year-over-year growth. We also announced multiple strategic transactions in the fourth quarter that better position us for the long term. We made two Midland Basin acquisitions, Lario and FireBird, both of which are now closed and seamlessly integrated that added over 500 high-quality opportunities and 83,000 net acres to our portfolio. This additional inventory, along with the associated production and cash flow, has solidified our size and scale in the Midland Basin, giving us a strategic advantage as we execute on our capital programs for the decades to come.  Last summer, we bought in all the outstanding units of Rattler, which gives us additional flexibility to think strategically about our existing midstream portfolio. We now have the ability to monetize assets that trade at a higher multiple than our upstream business and use the proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet or acquire additional upstream assets. The first example of this was the sale of our 10% interest in the Gray Oak crude oil pipeline to Enbridge. We achieved a 1.75 multiple on our invested capital and used the proceeds to partially fund the cash portion of the Lario acquisition.  As we evaluated both our Rattler operated assets and equity method investments, we've also monetized multiple noncore upstream positions. We have now divested nearly $600 million in upstream assets since the third quarter of last year, which includes two recent deals in Southeast Glasscock and Ward and Winkler counties. These assets simply did not compete for immediate capital within our portfolio. We have now increased our noncore asset target sales from $500 million to at least $1 billion by the end of this year. Last year, we improved our leverage ratio, now below 1x, and also pushed the tenor of nearly 90% of our debt past 5 years, with over $2 billion due in the 2050 at an average coupon of below 5%. We will continue to use free cash flow and proceeds from our noncore asset sales to lower our overall debt profile, continually improving our financial position. As we move into 2023, we expect to deliver relatively flat pro forma production year-over-year. When you account for the 11 months of Lario and a full year of FireBird production contribution, our guidance reflects 260,000 barrels of oil a day and $2.6 billion in CapEx, while running 15 rigs and 4 simul-frac crews. In closing, 2022 was an outstanding year for the company. We generated record free cash flow and distributed nearly 70% of it to our shareholders, strengthened our balance sheet, extended our inventory runway and continue to produce one of the highest margin barrels in the industry. Looking ahead, our business model is working, and we are confident in our 2023 outlook and our ongoing ability to continue generating peer-leading returns for our stockholders. With these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes Neal Dingmann from Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for all the details, Travis. My first question is just on shareholder return topic. More than -- it's now been maybe even two years ago, certainly, more than a year ago, you mentioned way back that you thought once the macro supply demand was more in balance, you'd consider potentially more growth. I'm just wondering, has the thinking changed based on what we know of continued investor shareholder return or other factors that continue to drive sort of the environment in today? Travis Stice : Yes, Neal, I don't think the macro conditions are dictating any kind of production growth currently. I mean you still have an uncertain Fed action. You've got uncertainty around China COVID, demand recovery. You've still got Russian barrels that are still finding their way into the market. So it doesn't appear to me that the macro conditions have fundamentally changed. And certainly, the feedback -- and perhaps, most importantly, the feedback we get from our shareholders are encouraging us to continue to embrace a shareholder return more. Kaes Van't Hof : Yes. I think also on top of that, Neal, we're going to be growing oil production per share significantly in 2023 through two well-timed acquisitions and a significant amount of buybacks in 2022. So per share metrics continue to improve. We continue to invest in high-return projects while not having to change our activity plan on a monthly basis trying to follow the crude price. The plan is the plan, and this steady state of activity has produced good results to date and no need to change that while it's working right now. Neal Dingmann : Good point, Kaes. That might really leads to my follow-up just on capital efficiency. Specifically, when I look at -- by our calculation, you all pump out more free cash flow per barrel of oil than any E&P. And I'm just wondering, when you look at this driver, is that based -- is that driven largely on this co-development that you talked about? Is it capital efficiency? I'm just wondering, you all just most recently seem to be hitting all the right numbers. But I'm wondering when I look at this all important metric, what Travis or you, Kaes, would consider maybe some of the drivers of that. Travis Stice : Yes. It's certainly not just one thing, Neal. It's really a combination of all the things that we focus on really multiple times a day when it comes to executing our program. Certainly, well productivity enhancements add to that, but that's really an output of a very difficult decision we made in 2019 to pivot away from kind of the best two zone development strategy and embrace the multi-zone full section development strategy, which we're seeing benefits of today. You also hear us talk frequently about our cost structure and that cost structure is made up not only on the expense side where -- whether it's G&A or LOE, but also on the capital efficiency side where we continue to push the envelope, particularly on the variable cost side of things, simply doing more with less. And all of those things combined, I think, put us consistently towards the top of the most margin efficient producer in the basin. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question I had was around noncore asset sales and you did bump your target from $0.5 billion to $1 billion by year-end 2023. Can you give us a little bit more color around what are the natural strategic assets? And what the market looks like for asset sales right now? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, Neil, great question. I think we announced two E&P asset sales, noncore asset sales this quarter that I think fit the mold of what the market looks like right now. And that's assets that don't compete for capital in our capital plan for many, many years and a little bit of PDP associated with those assets. But generally, a buyer that is looking to develop those assets a lot faster than we're planning. And so these two deals, the buyers are going to get aggressive developing these two assets right away, which in the capital allocators, it's just good capital allocation from our perspective. Going into it, we expected to sell more midstream assets than E&P assets. So that's why we bumped the target, and we still have some strategic midstream investments that are nearing the point where they should be monetized. Gray Oak, I think, was a great example. We retained all of our commercial benefits of the transaction. We still move our barrels to the Gulf Coast. But just that from a financial perspective, the pipeline was a great investment and it worked, and we monetize it to the partners. So I'd expect more on the midstream side. We did highlight what we have from a midstream perspective in the deck for the first time, but we're going to be patient and prudent when it comes to selling assets. Neil Mehta : Yes, that's great perspective. And then the follow-up is the oil volume guide for the full year was solid. Q1 a little bit softer. So maybe you could just talk about the cadence of production over the course of the year and just how we should be thinking about the path for oil production in particular in 2023? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes. Good question as well. I think the plan when we acquired Firebird, Firebird was producing 17,000 barrels of oil a day. We guided to that asset producing 19,000 barrels of oil a day for the year 2023. So clearly, some growth on that asset we're already seeing, but we'll see the majority of that benefit going into Q2 to Q4. And then on top of that, obviously, closing the Lario acquisition on January 31, that immediately adds 6,000 net barrels a day -- or sorry, subtracts 6,000 net barrels a day from Q1 because we didn't get to count those volumes in January. So base case plan is to grow steadily from Q1 through Q4, and we got the projects to back that up. Operator : And our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : Travis, you mentioned in your prepared remarks how the company has really optimized its multi-zone co-development strategy over the last couple two, three years. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail around kind of what you're doing today? I know, on Slide 16, you gave us a lot of great detail on the amount of net lateral footage by zone, but I wanted to understand what you're doing to maybe mitigate some of the issues we're seeing from the industry in terms of parent-child interference and impact some delayed targets. And just your thoughts on sustaining the level of well productivity gains that you generated last year into the future. Travis Stice : Yes. Good question, Arun. In 2018 and early 2019, we were really studying this co-development strategy intently, and the significant observation that we made from our analysis was that essentially, all of these zones talk to each other. And if they talk to each other, which means you actually have pressure communication during the fracking operations, which subsequently also means that you're kind of sharing the reserves as an individual well is produced that if you don't get them upon initial -- the initial development that when you go back in later, you'll find those zones have experienced some depletion and that depletion degrades the efficiency of your stimulated rock volume, which ultimately changes the production profile. And so in order to address that, we examined our spacing assumptions, both side to side and top to bottom, and made adjustments to try to minimize those frac pressure interferences. Spread some zones out further, spread some zones above and below further, but essentially went into a section -- half of section this time was our development strategy and completed all the wells at one time and then brought them all on at one time. And that was a painful decision because it's a lot easier. In fact, I've been -- I've said it before that I'll take criticism from drilling the very best zone, but we found out that, that actually wasn't the right development strategy, and we took some things for that in 2019. But as you can see, we put some details in our -- on Slide 16, as you alluded to. We're -- in the Midland Basin, our well results are equivalent to what we were seeing in 2017. So very proud of the technical team and their diligence to try to crack a very difficult problem and then the courage to stay with that decision through periods when we were questioned about that development strategy. So I hope that answers your question, Arun. Arun Jayaram : That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up. I wanted to get some thoughts on some of the initial well results from FireBird. I believe in that transaction, you guys underwrote just over 350 gross locations, but you highlighted some potential upside based on co-development opportunities. I was wondering thoughts on maybe some of the initial results in the Wolfcamp A, which I don't think was part of your original assessment of locations that you paid for. Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, great question, Arun. I think FireBird, at the end of the day, is the quintessential Diamondback deal, where we know the space and like the back of our hand and have been communicating with the FireBird team as they tested their position further West in the basin than others have in the past. And we follow the results closely and posted a couple of recent results that I think confirm a couple of things, but also give us some hope on upside in the central prospect. And there's a couple of wells sand the future may vary on the Far West side. This was probably the farthest West test to date and not an area we underwrote, and you have a very good Wolfcamp A result Far West. And then in the Southern portion of the position, you have this -- sorry, you have the four corners two-wells Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry. And we underwrote Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A upside across the central prospect, and it's looking more like you can have Lower Spraberry with Wolfcamp A co-development across that position.  So early days yet, but definitely a positive sign from the FireBird deal, and our technical team's work in getting that deal across the finish line. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum from Cowen. David Deckelbaum : The first question is really just a follow-up on Arun's question. [indiscernible] you've seen a thematic of your peers testing additional zones this year. Maybe can you give us a sense of the 330 to 350 wells you're doing this year? [indiscernible] current inventory? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, David, you're breaking up a little bit there. So I'm going to try to repeat what I thought you said, which is, what other zones are we testing outside of our traditional development zones across the basin. Is that correct? David Deckelbaum : That's correct. Sorry about that. Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, no problem. So generally, right, the majority of our capital is going to be allocated to the best zones, co-development. A big development this year in kind of the sale of Robertson Ranches and the Central Martin County area. So that's where the majority of capital is getting deployed. Certainly, there are deeper tests going on throughout the basin. We have our Limelight Prospect, which covers that those deeper zones, a tariff structure on the eastern side of the Midland Basin, where we're going to be developing some Woodford and Barnett. Generally, we're probably going to drill 3 or 4 wells there this year. I don't think it's going to be 10, 15 plus, but I think generally, promising results from the deeper zones across the basin and the benefit of our position is that we hold a lot of those deeper zones, and we have a significantly large mineral company that owns mineral rights to the center of the earth forever in all those zones. So if those zones start getting leased up, it's a great benefit to the Diamondback-FireBird relationship. David Deckelbaum : And then [indiscernible] third year now of being in relatively a maintenance mode or low-growth mode, have you seen noticeable differences year-over-year in benefits from perhaps improved base declines? And how does decline [indiscernible] on '22 or '21? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, again, breaking up a little bit, but talking about base declines. I think the base business, obviously, the base decline continued to decrease since being a maintenance mode from 2020. We did add two acquisitions in FireBird and Lario, where they have built a lot of rate very quickly. And so those two deals have a higher decline rate than the base business, but I think we've managed that in our guidance and also manage that in how we're going to complete wells across the pro forma position. So certainly, base decline is coming down, but I really think the best benefit of this lower growth environment is that we can grow per share metrics while not having to change our development plan with every $10 move in oil price, right? The plan is the plan right now. Shale has certainly become longer cycle with these bigger pads. And so, we're not having to put a stress on the ops teams to move pads around if oil moves $5 or $10 a barrel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question maybe just following up on David's question there on capital efficiency. Capital efficiency looked great in Q4, and you turned to sales about 55 net wells and you hit oil when your guidance, we think, implied like 73 net wells, so that's great. For 2023, the number of wells to sales looks a little bit higher than what we would have expected, if we just use the amount of wells you did in '22 and then we add in the Lario and the FireBird deal wells. So are we looking at that math correctly for 2023? And any color you would have would be helpful since including the divestitures, we still think the '23 outlook looks conservative, and we're assuming that the priority is really to beat on CapEx and not volumes. Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, Jeanine, I think a couple of things, right? Q4 was going to be a great quarter going into December. We had -- obviously, we all had a winter storm here. Diamondback did not announce the winter storm impact, but certainly, the winter storm did impact our production. So going into the last 10 days of the quarter, we felt very good about where we sat and still hit guidance. And therefore, from a POP perspective, we kind of moved some wells from Q4 into Q1 to get a head start on POPs. It's not a huge capital impact, but it is a number where we guide to first production. So there's a good amount of POPS in Q1 2023 because we were ahead of schedule in Q4 and feeling good about where we started Q1 this year. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. And then maybe just going back to return of capital. Looking at just the buyback plus the variable amount for this quarter, the buyback was about 44% between the two of those. Is that rough split kind of indicative of what we should be expecting in the future? Or is it really just more opportunistic every quarter. We're just really just checking in if there's any change in how you're viewing the variable versus the buyback. Kaes Van't Hof : Yes, no change, Jeanine. Really, the variable is the output of how many shares we didn't buy back in a particular quarter, and the buyback is still going to be very opportunistic. And I think now that we've kind of gone through this for four or five quarters, you can see that we step in and buy back when things are weaker. There's still been a lot of volatility in the space. We're going through a period of that volatility right now. And so you look back at a quarter like Q4, bought back less shares in October and November, but hit the buyback very hard in December. And I think you can expect us to keep doing that and then having the variable be the output of what base dividend plus buyback doesn't get through in a particular quarter. Operator : Derrick Whitfield from Stifel has our next question. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all. Congrats on a strong year-end. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Kaes Van't Hof : Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Building on an earlier question, I wanted to focus on your well productivity. Aside from the development sequencing impacts, are there one to two primary drivers that would explain the improvement you observed in all performance year-over-year? Kaes Van't Hof : I think the biggest benefit, Derrick, is not only the assets we acquired from QEP and guide on, I think that deal while done at a tough time hit exactly what you're looking for in a transaction, right? We allocate more capital to those assets that we would have allocated to the business prior to the deals. So we're seeing a little benefit there. Those assets are also in areas where you have three or four or even five zone development, and so we're having massive pads come on in high-return areas with a little bit of a benefit on the Viper side with high mineral interest across that position. So space -- as Travis mentioned earlier in the call, taking a close look at spacing, learning from other operators in the basin, what to do and what not to do and implementing that very quickly into our plan is paying dividends. Derrick Whitfield : Perfect. And for my follow-up, I wanted to focus on your 2023 capital program. If we were to assume a flat commodity price environment, where are your greatest headwinds and tailwinds from a service cost perspective? Kaes Van' t Hof : The biggest headwind over the last six quarters has been casing costs. Now we can certainly see around the corner that maybe we're seeing some softening there. I'm not going to count on it until we see it, but casing has moved up from, let's call it, $40 or $50 a foot to $110 a foot. It's 20% of our Midland Basin well cost now, and that's a significant headwind over the last 6 quarters. I think the headwind is going to ease. If not, it's a little bit out of our control. But the things that we can control are the efficiencies gained from simul-frac operations. We'll probably have four simul-frac crews running by Q2 of this year, which is highly efficient, saves about $30 a foot versus conventional crews. And on top of that, two of those crews are going to be the Halliburton e-fleet Zeus crews, and those use less fuel, but also run on cheap Waha gas right now. So that saves another $15 or $20 a foot. So we're doing what we can to cut costs and keep costs as low as possible in an inflationary environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities. Roger Read : I'd just like to maybe dive into the gas takeaway question and how you're -- I understand how you're positioned not to have Waha basis risk for the most part, but what are you looking at in terms of flow assurance this year and to the extent you can say next year? Kaes Van't Hof : Good question, Roger. I don't think flow assurance is going to be an issue for us, but we are exposed to the Waha price based on how the contracts are written. Through the history of Diamondback, we've been very acquisitive, and when we acquire things, it comes with contracts. And so, all those contracts are with private equity backed or some of the public gatherers and processors in the basin. So I feel really good about our flow assurance and our contracts, the issue is going to be price. And what we've seen in the basin is some tightness coming out of the basin on Waha when pipelines have gone up or gone down over the last six months. But really, there's a lot of processing capacity that's now coming on in the early part of 2023, particularly with two of our Midland Basin gatherers and processors. And I think that generally is going to move the issue further downstream. So it's going to be a tight gas market in the Permian. Henry Hub prices obviously aren't helping as well, but we feel good that the gas will move, and we're well hedged financially to protect from that downside. Roger Read : Appreciate that. And the other question I wanted to follow up on -- I am just looking for the right page, yes, Page 23 on the hedge summary. Any thoughts on -- if we look at where Q1 has hedged, Q2 really kind of similar, is that what you'd want to do ultimately for the back half of the year as we draw in closer and it becomes more financially reasonable to do that? Or are you, at this point, more comfortable going a little less hedged just given the overall structure of the balance sheet, presumably with these dispositions coming, a little more cash coming in? Kaes Van' t Hof : Great question, Roger. We don't believe in no hedges, I think, primarily because our balance sheet is a hedge. Our cost structures are hedged, but we consider our base dividend debt, right? And our base dividend is now $3.20 a share. It's almost $550 million of outflows a year. We think it's well protected today at $40 a barrel but we don\u2019t want to put that in harm's way. So we buy puts as fire insurance, and we basically use the front quarter to extend duration three or four quarters out. We try to be 50% to 60% hedged going into a particular quarter on oil down to 0% hedge four, five quarters out. So I think you can continue to expect us to do that, and your observations are 100% correct that in the back half of the year, it will grow as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from [Jeoffrey Lambujon] from [Perella Weinberg Partners.] Unidentified Analyst : Just a couple for me, follow-ups on the service cost environment and Diamondback read-through specifically. I guess, first, I appreciate the comments on what you're watching for and how Diamondback is positioned to really maximize what you all can control. But I wonder if you could speak a little more broadly to what you're expecting in terms of year-over-year changes on inflation. I think the materials speak to 15% as the base case and really more so how that compares to what you're seeing on a leading-edge basis? And then I guess last one is, how we should think about the balance of the CapEx guide for this year in that context? And then the second part of my question is, just looking for a snapshot of well cost today on a per foot basis are tracking relative to the full year guide range and also relative to the mid-November snapshot that we got in last quarter's earnings? Kaes Van't Hof : Good question, Jeoff. I think, generally, we guided to this year being around 15% year-over-year well costs, sub-10% from what we highlighted in November. And I would say, generally, those numbers still fit today. I would say, we're probably in the upper half of our well cost guidance for both Midland and Delaware today. But generally, there are some things coming our way outside of service cost deflation and that's another Halliburton Zeus e-fleet moving to four simul-fracs versus last year, we ran three in a spot crew. So that last simul-frac adds some efficiency. And I kind of put the budget two ways this year. I think if we see deflation, we're going to be closer to the lower half of our guide. And if we stay flat, we'll be to midpoint to the higher end. But I think generally, the anecdotes are coming in that some things are heading our way from a service cost perspective. And unlike last year, not everything -- not every line item will go up in the AFE. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Scott Gruber : I want to circle back on the completion efficiency comments. E-frac obviously brings a pretty good fuel savings given the gas diesel spread here and obviously, associated ESG benefits. But do you think e-frac additions will be additive to the improvement in cycle times above and beyond what you're seeing from simul-frac? Kaes Van't Hof : I think, generally, Scott, they complete a similar amount of lateral feet as the simul-frac crews as we're seeing early time. But on top of that, e-fleets on a fuel efficiency basis, not just the type of fuel, but the efficiency of the fuel used has been a positive surprise. I think the last thing I would add is that it does operate on a much smaller footprint. So maybe your moves are smaller, but you do have some electrical infrastructure associated with those fleets. Dan, do you want to add anything on that? Danny Wesson : Yes. I think we've only been running the first crew for about six months, and we've been really impressed with the performance thus far. It's outperformed our other fleets kind of on the margin, but not too measurable. We do believe that over time, you'll see that gap widen in performance, just really believe that the maintenance required around the e-fleet equipment will be substantially less. So we're excited to learn through that with Halliburton and recognize some added efficiencies on top of just fuel savings as we go forward. Scott Gruber : And if service costs do start to slip in the Permian with Haynesville rigs and frac crews coming out migrating over, how quickly do you think that will hit your D&C costs? If that starts to kind of pivot here in the near future, is there an ability for you to realize that in the second half? Or we really talk about the 2024 benefit just given your contracts kind of in place at this juncture? Danny Wesson : Yes. I mean we don't really have any long-term contracts in place. We kind of have shorter cycle pricing agreements I think generally, we're exposed to market pricing across the board, and we certainly have some protections in place on some of our consumables, but if we start seeing the market soften, which we feel like is a pretty good likelihood with where we see gas prices today, that should trickle down into the oil basins, particularly on the drilling services side of things first. And we've certainly not seen a lot of upward pressure on pricing in the first part of this year. It's been pretty quiet, and hopefully, we'll start seeing some help on the inflation front here through the second and third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy from Pickering Energy Partners. Kevin MacCurdy : Congratulations on the great free cash flow quarter. It looks like cash taxes came in well under expectations and the guidance for 2023 cash taxes was below our model. I wonder if you can talk about what is driving the cash taxes lower, and any benefits you may be receiving from acquisitions? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Kevin. The biggest benefit we did receive in the fourth quarter, obviously, commodity prices came down quarter-over-quarter, Q3 to Q4. So that was a surprise for the positive on cash taxes. I guess that hurts you overall. But the biggest deferral we got was when we closed the FireBird deal came with about $100 million of midstream assets and some other fixed assets that we're able to depreciate right away, and so that allowed us to defer more taxes into 2023. As we've modeled 2023, we still have about $1 billion of NOL that will be exhausted this year. But on top of that, also closing the FireBird or the Lario transaction, which added some midstream and fixed assets as well. So generally, this is kind of our last year before being a full cash taxpayer. About two well timed deals allowed us to push out a little more cash. Obviously, it's not the reason why we do the deals, but it's a nice tangential benefit. Operator : Our next question comes from Leo Mariani from ROTH MKM. Leo Mariani : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about LOE trends. Just looking at the guide here. In '23, you guys are expecting LOE to come up a little bit kind of versus where it was in '22? Maybe just a little color around what you're sort of seeing there. Travis Stice : Yes. I think you've got just a couple things that are impacting LOE. First, we're fairly exposed to the power market, and we rode through the back half of last year fairly unhedged through the -- we're up in gas prices and that really impacted our real-time power pricing, and you've seen kind of real-time power pricing kind of stay a little elevated through the first part of 2023 here. And so trying to guess where we're going to land with respect to power and have an opportunity to get hedged to protect ourselves, but -- so that's adding about a dime. And then you've got another impact from the FireBird acquisition with about 900 vertical wells, which had another dime or two to our consolidated LOE. So between those two things, you're looking at about a quarter, and we think we're probably running in the lower end of the guide today. And if we see some things come our way, we think we could potentially be under the guide, but we're not baking that into our guidance. Leo Mariani : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on M&A, obviously, you guys were helpful in terms of talking about some of these noncore asset sales, but I think you did mention in your prepared comments that perhaps, some of those proceeds could go to bolt-ons out there in the space. I was hoping you guys could just give us a little color in terms of what you're seeing? Are there bolt-ons available that are kind of in and around your asset base? And how would you kind of characterize the market now? Do you think that generally speaking, expectations from sellers are reasonable these days? Just trying to get a sense of whether or not there's a decent chance you might pick something up here in '23? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes. I don't know if sellers are ever reasonable, Leo. But generally, I do think the two larger transactions did happen because Diamondback's cost structure was differential in the second half of the year and going into 2023, right? We're drilling wells $2 million, $3 million, $4 million cheaper in the Midland Basin than peers, and that is when you underwrite PUDs, that drives value to the good guys even if you're not running strip oil pricing. So I think generally, that's what's happened. There's less and less large opportunities like the two that we announced last fall. So it's relatively quiet at the moment. But some of the smaller things that tend to trend with the large deals like the blocking and tackling, a couple of other deals that Firebird and Lario we're working on when they sold. That's the kind of stuff that we're focused on right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : In your presentation, you show a number of the energy ownership that in the pipeline and gas processing. Just curious that if any of those that you will consider strategically important for you to own their equity ownership? Or that -- I mean just trying to see that I mean, whether any of them have that strategic importance to you? Second question is that when we're looking at your inventory backlog, for those you consider over 10,000 feet, lateral length, you roughly say, call it, 5,500. Just want to see if we can drill a little bit more into that, and what percentage of those wells you can actually do maybe 3-miles? And whether there's an opportunity for trade and swap that you think you may be able to improve on that? Kaes Van't Hof : Great. Thank you, Paul. I'll take the first one on the JVs. We did highlight all of these JVs. I think generally, these all sat at our Rattler entity before consolidating it. Generally, from a financial perspective, I think they're all good investments that eventually will be monetized at higher value than what we paid -- what we put in. But the strategy behind why we did these things is that we got commercial agreements and benefits locked in with the financial piece. So whether it's -- like the Gray Oak pipeline, right? We got 100,000 barrels a day of space on the pipeline, that's not changing even though we sold our equity interest in the pipe. On the gas processing side, we invested 20% into WTG. We and our partners decided to build 200 million a day cryo plants immediately after closing the deal, and that is alleviating a lot of the gas flaring and gas processing issues in the Northern Midland Basin. So we try to drive value through molecules committed to these investments, but generally, at some point, it makes sense to monetize them.  On the inventory side, we try to drill 15,000 feet wherever we can. I think most of our land in the Midland Basin is pretty locked up from a lateral length perspective. I think generally, if we had four sections North to South, we would drill through 10,000-foot laterals. If we had five sections North to South, which is rare, we would drill two sets of 12,500 foot laterals. And if we had three sections, we would drill 15,000-foot laterals over two 7,500-foot laterals. So we underwrote the FireBird deal with a lot of 15,000 footers because that is a big contiguous block. And on the other side, Lario, pretty landlocked in the center of Martin County with a lot of competitors around. So we kind of had to live with the lateral length as they were presented. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate : So I'll just ask, I think it was the case. I think you did touch on the M&A line of sight. I wonder if I could just dig into that a little bit more, particularly on the remaining asset sales and whether those are midstream weighted? Do you see additional opportunities in front of you that are midstream rated? And if so, are you basically looking to pay back your main exposure? I guess I'm really trying to understand how that impacts the cash flow of E&P business? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes. Good question, Doug. I would say, generally, we were surprised at the amount of E&P assets we sold relative to initial expectations of $500 million of noncore asset sales because we raised that to $1 billion. We're at $750 million to date. It's logical that most of those -- most of the rest of the $250 million or more come from noncore asset comes from midstream assets. I will say if they're -- it's going to be harder for us to sell operated midstream assets versus non-op midstream assets like the JVs that we highlighted in the back of our deck like you inferred, operated midstream assets do have an impact on LOE and financials. Whereas non-operated assets, you do have a cash flow impact from less distributions from those assets, but not as meaningful to the parent co. So I think it's logical that more non-op stuff is top of mind, but for the right value, some operated stuff would be on the table. Just we'd be cognizant of what that would do to our operating metrics. Doug Leggate : Okay. I guess we'll watch and see how -- the raise is obviously a positive. So thanks for the clarification. Guys, I apologize for being predictable. I'm going to put myself in the cross-hairs a little bit and go back to the cash tax question because it's through a sort of bit of a loop, to be perfectly honest. But it's about 50% bigger than the P&L tax. And what we are trying to figure out is, when E&P kicks in, which I guess would be the end of this year because you'll have had $1 billion of earnings presumably for three consecutive years, what in the $45 million of deferred tax, it's about 1/3 of your free cash flow, what do you think the normalized level of deferred tax would be if the conditions were the same? Is that an easy question to answer? Kaes Van't Hof : Yes. I mean, I guess the answer would be, we're going to get through all of our NOL in 2023. So that will be exhausted, and we'll be a full cash taxpayer, although as you mentioned, we will be able to defer some with respect to intangible drilling costs and the CapEx we spend on the business. So I guess it will be dependent upon where -- obviously, where commodity prices are in 2024. And second to that, where CapEx is, I think we're obviously in a world where we're going to be spending -- continue to spend less than we make. So it's logical that there will be a tax burden. There's just too many variables right now to predict 2024. Operator : With no further questions, I would like to hand it back to Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks. Travis? Travis Stice : Thank you, again, to everyone for participating in today's call. If you have any questions, please contact us using the information provided. Thank you. Operator : Okay. That's it for today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Gina. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's first quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and stockholder letter, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and Adam mentioned that we released a shareholder letter last night in conjunction with our press release. I hope you find that useful. We believe that it not only increases transparency directly to our shareholders, but also improves efficiency. So we'll move right into questions. Operator, if you would open the line and begin with our first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : First, thanks, Travis, for the new format. Appreciate it. Travis, my first questions for you or Danny, on one of the top [indiscernible] that service costs. Specifically, are you able to quantify how your continued operational efficiencies have recently mitigated the cost? And just wondering how you all think about spot versus long-term contracts in the current environment? Travis Stice : I think, Neal, the read through that question is, kind of what the CapEx is going to look like in the back half of the year. And I think there's -- and I will let Danny talk about the specific operational efficiencies we've seen year-to-date, that's offset most of the inflationary pressures. But when we talk about deflation, it's really -- that's raw materials. It's diesel, it's sand, it's steel, particularly on steel, because we're buying our steel needs multiple quarters in advance. So we know what that steel cost is. And it's already down for the future purposes $20 to $25 a foot. And then we've also got the rigs we talked about what we\u2019re involved with a couple of rigs, and that allows us to do -- to look at our entire rig fleet and the cost associated with those rigs and we see rig costs are coming down as well. And then lastly, it's -- while it's not necessarily a CapEx issue, we're seeing improved efficiencies as we've got that second e-fleet that's -- that started last week. And we've also got rid of our two spot frac crews and replace them with one simulfrac crew. So we're seeing $10 to $20 a foot efficiency gains there as well. So regardless, Neal, of what's going on with CapEx, our commitment has always been to be the low-cost leader when it comes to prosecuting our development plan out here, and we've got now almost a decade of demonstrating that. So we anticipate that we're going to continue to do that. And that's what our shareholders should be comfortable in. Danny, do you have some additional color for near-term? Danny Wesson : No, I think Travis covered everything that we're -- we've kind of seen on the drilling services side and consumable side, on the drilling side, that\u2019s leading us to see leading edge costs coming down. And then on the completion side, just with the additional efficiencies from the additional e-fleet as well as the replacement simulfrac fleet replacing the two traditional zipper fleets that we took over as far as the two acquisitions at the end of the year. Neal Dingmann : Great. Thank you for that. And then my second question for Kaes on shareholder return. Kaes, specifically it seems you all plan to stick to or you are sticking to that 75% free cash flow payout. Can you give me your opinion on maybe why not pay more like some peers and on the capital allocation part of the shareholder return, is that plan still just to see what your stock price is doing versus the mid cycle, or how do you determine that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neal, we always -- when we upped the shareholder return program to 75% of free cash going back to shareholders, we bought the mix of 75% equity and 25% to the balance sheet was a good mix. We still believe that's a good mix. I think when things are going well, like they have in the last couple of years, 75% feels like a max number to go back to equity while continuing to improve the balance sheet. Really the test of this new business model and returns -- return of capital-based business models when things go south in a potential downturn, that's, I think, the time when we should be allocating more capital to buying back shares, reducing the share count a lot more efficiently than it is even when things are going well at today. So we've kept a flexible return of capital program since the beginning. I think we like that. We want to keep that. And Q1 is an exact reason why we maintain that flexibility. We don't want to blow out the balance sheet to buy back stocks, but we also recognize that when your stock is down significantly in the quarter, variable dividend doesn't matter. And that's what we did in Q1 and allocated a lot more cash to the buyback. Neal Dingmann : Glad to see it. Thank you all. Travis Stice : Thanks, Neal. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs & Co. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning, team. And again, thanks for the new format. The first question was around gas price realizations. Obviously, they were soft in the quarter. There's some one-time dynamics it felt like. But just curious on your views on how local gas pricing is going to play out here? And what protections you guys have built in place in order to mitigate pricing negativity? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neil, good question. I think it's two things, right? There's certainly the unhedged realized gas prices for us that were weaker in the quarter relative to the expectations. Really a lot of that comprised a $15 million true-up payment between contracts that moved from selling at the wellhead to taking on our -- taking kind rights downstream. So that's kind of an intercompany issue, but I recognize it did hit gas presence for the quarter. What we've done from a hedging perspective and from a physical perspective to protect against future gas price loss in the basin, which we think there's going to be periodic points of weakness throughout this year and next. We've hedged all of our Waha exposure in the basin, which is about two-thirds of our gas through the end of 2024. And then the other one-third of our gas gets combination of Henry Hub and Houston Ship Channel prices. And then on the Henry Hub side, we have protected with wide collars with a $3 floor, about two-thirds of our gas this year in 2023 and probably a third of it next year. So in general, I think we tried to give the Street some guidance on future unhedged gas realizations and the hedging piece has been a tailwind for us as gas prices weakened both at Henry Hub and in the basin. Neil Mehta : Okay. Thanks for that, Kaes. And then just a follow-up on some of the recent acquisitions that you've done here that you've had them in your portfolio now for a couple of months. Just any update on how they're executing early thoughts on productivity and efficiencies that you're able to realize out of the new assets? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, that's a great question as well. I would say, generally, Lario, we knew what we were getting. That asset is nearby all of our existing production in Martin County. So that's as advertised. I think at the end of the day, when we look back at the FireBird acquisition, in a few years that's going to be one of the better value deals we got. We estimated there's almost 500 locations on that acquisition without even pushing the limit on upside locations. And there's been some well tests where we've co-developed the Lower Spraberry and the Wolfcamp A on the southern part of the position that gives us confidence that some of those upside locations are going to become real locations that we are going to develop over time. Second to that, the ops team, they're going into a new area. We are already completing or drilling a 15,000-foot lateral and sub 10 days on the new field. So everything is going well on both those deals. I would say, generally, over time, FireBird will prove to be one of the better deals we did because of the amount of acreage that came with it and the upside from a geologic perspective. Neil Mehta : Awesome. Thanks, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Neil. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, guys. We do appreciate the new format. So that was really helpful. My first question is on CapEx. Your first half CapEx guidance plus the 1Q actual implies around $1.36 billion in spending or about 52% of the budget. You talked about having line of sight to some meaningful declines in service costs. So I was wondering maybe Kaes, if you could describe your confidence on hitting, call it, the midpoint of the range of $2.6 billion for the full year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Arun Jayaram : And how does your cash -- I know you account for CapEx on a cash basis versus accrual basis. How does that influence the timing of CapEx in a rising service price environment versus when it's falling? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Arun. On the cash CapEx thing, the prime example was Q2 of 2020, while I don't want to relive that particular quarter, we reduced our rig count from 15 -- or 23 rigs down to 6, and we had to pay for that in the second quarter. So there's a big disconnect between accrued and cash CapEx. Now that's not the issue we faced here, right? We are talking about things at the margin like a $50 million or so reduction in run rate CapEx, which is, in my mind, very achievable based on three things : lower activity, we are going to reduce our rig count by 2 rigs as expected at the end of this quarter through the back half of the year. Second, lower service costs and Travis broke those down into the drilling side, which is a significant reduction in raw materials and a smaller reduction in the service piece of the drilling side. And on the other side of that DC&E line completions down because of efficiencies because of the high grading to two zones [ph] fleets with Halliburton and two simulfrac fleets. And lastly, midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money on midstream, building out our Martin County water system that's nearing its end, so that the whole system is connected and infrastructure generally slows down in the back half of the year. So that's the line of sight we have. We feel very confident that those things are coming our way based on what we can see in the accrued numbers that we pay for over the next 45 to 60 days on the cash side and CapEx. Travis Stice : Yes. And just again to -- Arun to reiterate my opening comment to the first question is that our commitment to our shareholders remain unchanged to be the low-cost leader in efficiency and in execution. And it's certainly been our track record, and that's what we anticipate going forward. But our commitment hasn't changed regardless of what CapEx does. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot, Travis. My follow-up, team, we've heard about some industry activity and leasing in the Midland Basin in deeper zones. Can you remind us how your leases are structured? Do you have rights to those zones currently? And perhaps this obviously could have some positive implications for VNOM. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how FANG's leases are structured and maybe positive implications for VNOM? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. There's really no one size fits all to leases in the Midland Basin. I would say generally, we have most of our leases cover the Wolfcamp B, which is a deeper zone that's going to get a lot more attention over the coming years and some to a lesser extent, we have the Barnett and Woodford covered now. We've been exploring the Barnett and Woodford on the Eastern - on the Western side of the Midland Basin for a very long time now with our Limelight play. It seems that the Barnett and Woodford Play is going to extend more into the actual basin, and that's something that we're involved in, along with many other large peers testing that zone and looking at it for future development in the end of this decade, into the next decade. We'll say, generally, that's the benefit of owning a lot of minerals is that we have the other side of our business card that is going to have a front seat to leasing any of those deeper rights should they be unleased throughout the basin. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Travis Stice : Thank you, Arun. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. Turning back to service rates, the service companies have been talking about a bifurcated market here for both rigs and frac pumps and their characterization is that the highly efficient crews, the next-gen kit, especially nat gas fuel rigs and pumps will largely maintain pricing, while it's going to be the legacy equipment and/or lower quality crews where you'll see the more meaningful declines in rates. Is that how you see the market developing here? Or do you see more broad-based reductions in pricing kind of across this spectrum? Kaes Van' t Hof : Scott, I think that's partially true. Certainly, on the frac side, the higher quality equipment, the superspec e-fleet those have real contracts associated with them with less global room on pricing. So that's why we think generally, we make more money or save more money there on the efficiency side. On the rig side, I think generally, the 10% of your market is going away in a quarter or 2, it's going to have an impact on pricing. There's just no doubt about that. So leading edge rates certainly are lower. I think we've also proven in the past to do more with less when it comes to equipment on the rig side, particularly in the Midland Basin, where it's a lot easier to drill in general than other places around the country. Scott Gruber : Got it. And then just turning to operating costs, LOE came in at the low end of the range. We kept the full year and then you mentioned the fixed price contracts for power. Just any color that you can provide on how operating costs should evolve over the course of the year, given the outlook for natural gas and power and other things, chemicals, et cetera, go into operating costs? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Look, I think obviously, we had a very good start to the year on LOE. We still feel good about the midpoint of that range mainly because not because of power, but because of some of our activity is moving to areas where we have water dedicated to third parties, not ourselves. And so that has a little higher rate. And so we expect LOE to trend up a little bit in Q2, Q3 as some of those big pads on third-party areas are developed. But generally, we received a benefit in terms of gas prices on the power side to lock in a lot of power. And I would say generally, we've locked in about 75% of our expected power needs for the foreseeable future that should keep LOE generally lower for longer and less exposed to the price spikes that we saw last summer. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate the color, Kaes. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, Travis, Kaes, Danny and team. Thanks for taking my questions today. Travis Stice : Sure. Good morning, David. David Deckelbaum : Morning. Just longer term from an efficiency gains perspective, you all made some headway and you highlighted the benefits of using e-fleets and moving that second e-fleet this year. How do you think about as we progress into '24 and '25, the mix between simulfrac fleet and e-fleets, if we assume sort of this flattish rig count towards the two to two mix, the expectation for longer-term development? Danny Wesson : Yes, David, good question. I think our plan right now looking out into '24, '25 is probably to stick with the kind of 50-50 mix. We would basically have to underwrite the e-fleets and sign up for a longer-term commitment with them which is a little harder to do 100% of your capacity committed for a long-term commitment. But the additional simulfrac fleet as more e-fleets come to market and are available in a, I guess, spot basis, we would certainly migrate to more e-fleets that we have some flexibility around utilization. David Deckelbaum : Got it. And then my second question just around asset sales. You already did around $773 million or so the date you point out that you've exceeded your target. You guys also highlight the remaining five or so outstanding investments that you're articulating on slide back in the back, mostly on the midstream side might be a source of funds going forward. Could you place like -- is there a high probability that we'll see another asset sale this year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I would place a pretty high probability on that, David. We wouldn't have increased our target from $500 million to $1 billion of noncore divestitures if we didn't have a pretty good line of sight. I can't guarantee it's going to happen today, but certainly there's a few things in the works, either on the JV side or some of the small operated midstream assets that could be up for sale. So we still feel very comfortable with that $1 billion target. I would just say it's tailored more towards midstream versus upstream. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate it. Thanks for the time guys. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Kaes Van' t Hof : Rod, you're on mute if you're on the line. Travis Stice : So let's move to the next question, please. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin MacCurdy : Hey, good morning. With the 1Q release, you've kind of given the pictures to figure out what the 4Q '22 or '23 CapEx and activity is. As we look into potential 2024 maintenance CapEx program, is the 4Q activity kind of a good activity and CapEx is a good starting point? Or would you need to add any activity to keep production flat next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : That's a good question, Kevin. I'm not fully ready to commit to 2024 today. But I would say, if we had to commit today, running some sort of plan with for simulfrac crews is probably the most efficient and capital efficient plan we can put together. Now whether that spits out slight growth to flat production is to be determined. But I think generally running this capital efficient plan without changing activity levels too much and letting growth be the output has been, I think, rewarded over the last couple of years with this new business model, and that's kind of where we are circling things going forward. Kevin MacCurdy : Great. That\u2019s the only question for me. Thanks guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Kevin. Travis Stice : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning all and congrats on a strong start to the year. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Derrick. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Building on an earlier question on Waha price weakness, could you perhaps elaborate on the degree of tightness you're projecting with in-basin fundamentals? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Derrick, good question. I think generally, we are going to see very -- a lot of volatility and some pockets of extreme weakness. Obviously, there's a few expansions coming on, three expansions in the back half of this year and the beginning of next year, ahead of a large flat coming on at the end of 2024. I just think there -- the issue to date had been masked in the field as processing capacity in the field was short. Now that that processing capacity is coming on, the tune of bcf a day or more that's going to push the problem downstream to the downstream residue pipes. So I think it's coming, it's going to be pretty weak for periods and then pressure will be relieved a little bit when these expansions come on. But generally, our take is, let's remove our risk to that pricing weakness by hedging everything through 2024 and getting more physical molecules for the Gulf Coast. Ideally, we'd like to have control of all of our molecules to the Gulf Coast, but most of our contracts we inherited from deals that we bought have not come with taking kind rights, and we've worked to improve that over time and control more of our molecules further downstream. Derrick Whitfield : Great. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on well productivity, which has been a positive development for you guys. Referencing Slide 14, could you speak to your expectations for 2023 well productivity relative to 2022? And how does that project over the next couple of years as you think about the integration of Lario and FireBird acquisitions? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question. I think we said multiple times to investors, flat to 2022 is probably the base case, and we do a little better. That's one for the good guys. I think we are on pace for that, particularly in the Midland Basin where we've had a really strong start to the year. And I would just say FireBird and Lario only enhance that ability to do that for longer. At the end of the day, as we've said before, the shale cost curve is going up. It's our job to make sure we have the inventory duration and the cost structure to be at the low end of that shale cost curve, which we've done well for the last 10 years, and we expect to do well for the next 10 years. Derrick Whitfield : Well done, guys. Travis Stice : Yes, Derrick, I think just to reiterate that point that I've made a couple of times now about Diamondback's commitment to our shareholders about maintaining the lead and efficiency and cost execution. It's exactly what Kaes just said. Derrick Whitfield : Thanks for the added color, Travis. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Hey, thanks. Could you all provide a little bit of color on the cadence of activity moving forward? I mean you all talk about having some larger pads going forward. And you all have had a very smooth production trajectory. Does some of these large pads, will that create some lumpiness? Or is there some timing considerations we need to think about as we see those being developed? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question, Scott. I would say internally, it certainly does. This business is not easy to grow consistently and hit numbers consistently. But externally, we think we are going to grow fairly smoothly organically through the back half of the year. In general, our target is to turn about 85 wells to sales a quarter, some quarters are going to be a little higher, some are a little lower based on timing. But in general, that's our job, right. It's -- there's a lot going on beneath the surface, and that's what makes the Diamondback operations team the best in the business. Scott Hanold : Great. And then if we could talk about M&A a little bit. And it looks like some of the private equity companies are dropping rigs in the Permian. And obviously there have been some sales and talks of more sales coming up. Like what are you all seeing on the private side in terms of activity? And what's your interest level in looking at some of additional M&A opportunities? Travis Stice : Yes, we've commented a couple of times about the increase in activity through 2022 was largely driven by independents and the challenge there is depth of inventory, right? And the secondary challenge is how much can increase further beyond their max cadence that they achieved last year. And I think both of those are playing out now. The max cadence may be softening, as you see by rigs getting laid down. And certainly, the inventory depth is getting accelerated with this rapid pace of bringing wells to production. So I think from an M&A perspective, it's going to be an interesting time over the next couple of years as these entities, the small ones, private, just try to figure out a way to monetize. And I think you've also got while their catalyst is unclear, you've also got some small cap public companies that are going to need to figure out some form of exit strategy to be -- continue to be relevant in the future. And then there's always the large private unicorns that's still flowing around out there as well, too. So I really think the next couple of years are going to be interesting in the M&A landscape. Scott Hanold : Yes. So do you believe though that some of these private equities that have burned through a lot of their acreage? Does that make -- does the inventory factor make it less interesting to you all? Or is there a case to be made if you can buy PDPs cheap enough and kind of manage them down there in interest? Travis Stice : Well, Scott, when you do M&A, and if you do it correctly, you want to extend inventory life, you want to make sure that your free cash flow or cash flow accretive and you don't want to impact your balance sheet. So just doing PDP type acquisitions doesn't necessarily fit into that calculus, but it's -- I think that's what you're going to end up seeing with some of these exit strategies or just kind of straight PDP divestitures. Scott Hanold : Fair enough. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon of TPH. Your line is now open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Travis Stice : Hi, Jeff. Jeoffrey Lambujon : The first one is just on commentary and the supplemental release that talked about the trend continuing this year in terms of the large high NRI pads coming on in the Northern Midland Basin. Is there any additional color you can give there in terms of how the mix of the total program going to that type of acreage where you might have much less surrounding development compares to that same mix or waiting to that type of acreage last year and just how to think about that mix over the near-term? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, good question, Jeff. I would say the mix of undeveloped DSUs is probably similar to years past. Now the quality of the location of those undeveloped DSUs is probably a little bit higher this year than in 2022 even. So it was kind of related to our comment on productivity. There's certainly a line of sight to very high productivity this year from development in the middle of Martin County and some of that, we have up to a 6% or 7% NRI on large pads at the Viper level. And so because we report consolidated financials, that is a benefit to the total enterprise, where the high-end development is going to drive organic production growth at the entity. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great. I appreciate that. And then on the services side, I certainly appreciate the detail just around where you see potential improvements and the timing around that throughout the year. I was just hoping you could speak maybe high-level to how your contracts are set up, I guess, across the services spectrum just to give a sense for how some of these improvements will layer in from Diamondback specifically over the course of the next couple of quarters? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I'd say on the rig size, everything is kind of a rolling 3 to 6-month contracts. So we see -- we can see that our Q2 average day rate is down from Q1 today. And so that's going to continue to come our way on the rig side. On the frac side, our two e-fleets on the simulfrac e-fleets are pretty locked up on pricing. I would say we saw some weakness in the spot frac pricing in Q1 versus Q4. And as we move those other two fleets to simulfrac fleets, I think the more benefit will be on the efficiency side than the price per horsepower side. But generally, a simulfrac fleet saves up $20 or $30 a foot regardless of the price of actual horsepower. Travis Stice : Jeff, in addition to that, we talked earlier about purchasing steel multiple quarters in advance. So we are seeing the steel that we are purchasing for our 3Q, 4Q, 1Q costs already coming down. And so while it's not necessarily a service cost deflation, it is a cost deflation that could be as much as $20 or $25 a foot additionally. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Appreciate it guys. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Hey, John. John Freeman : You all had -- in fourth quarter, when you all are running ahead of schedule and you moved some of those POPs from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, and just given all the commentary on the big efficiency gains on the final fracs as you now go to towards four with funnel fracability, if we end up in a similar spot where you have efficiency gains later this year, is it likely that you all -- and again, it's a first class problem, but would you similarly make a decision like last year where you would sort of, I don't know, pump the brakes is the right word, but maybe slowdown in touch so that the budget is intact? Or do you just sort of plow ahead with the efficiency gains and just bring more wells online? Kaes Van' t Hof : No. Listen, I think we are highly incentivized to hit the budget. I think high incentivized to increase free cash flow, which is part of the new business model, which has used growth for returns, and that's been the mentality. It's been a working mentality that has worked for the last couple of years. So it would be a first class problem. We are still early in the year, but generally that would be the plan now. I think the only nuance to that is we would like to keep rigs running and building DUCs, particularly if rig costs are a little bit lower than they are today. John Freeman : That's great. And then I really appreciate all the detail and color you've given on the service cost front. So does it sound like -- obviously, things are coming down from the peak levels of 1Q, but is it -- are you all basically indicating that you are on track to potentially have lower total completed well costs by year-end '23 versus year-end '22. Like when you factor in what you're seeing on the cost side, but maybe more importantly the efficiency gains from the simulfracs? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I would say, yes, that's a fair answer. I mean particularly, listen, steel is the biggest driver. I'm not -- we are not forecasting a total capitulation in service costs here. But when steel went up for nine quarters in a row to over $110 a foot, we see in Q3, our steel costs are going to be closer to $90 a foot. So I mean that in itself makes up for a significant percentage of the savings. So I would say, yes, Q4 2023 well costs below Q4 2022 because generally, Q4 '22 and Q1 '23 were the highest. John Freeman : That\u2019s great. I appreciate it guys. Travis Stice : John, listen, just to reemphasize, we run the business to maximize efficiency as well. And so Kaes made the point that whether it's on the rig side or the completion side, we are about efficiency because we think that that's the greatest driver of shareholder value in a business where you don't control the price of the product that you produce. John Freeman : Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Rezvan of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Tim Rezvan : Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back Dave's questions previously on asset sales. I'm sure you won't give a good answer on the Bloomberg story about Pecos County. But I think it highlights the number of levers that you can pull to get to $1 billion or more on asset sales. So trying to understand, Kaes, what do you think a good kind of target debt level is? Do you think about it in terms of leverage or an absolute debt metric as you compare yourselves to the large cap peers? And I guess why wouldn't you go bigger than that $1 billion given you're not allocating a lot of capital to the Delaware right now? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Tim, that's a good question. I'm not going to go bigger because we want to beat the number, first of all. But second to that, listen, the Delaware Basin overall still produces a lot of barrels and a lot of cash flow for us. And that's important to the credit ratings. It's important to our free cash flow forecast and all of the above. So I think we have sold a few small things in the Delaware on the acreage side. And the recurring theme of what we sold is that someone paid for upside. So we are not going to sell PDP cheap just to sell PDP. At the end of the day, someone has to pay for upside and pay for a faster pace of development than we were expecting. And that, I think, has been a common theme in the Delaware deals as well as the deal in Glasscock County, not only they pay for PDP, but they paid for some PUDs that didn't compete for us in the next 10 years plan. So if that happens, then we'll look at -- do what's right for our shareholders and look at divesting more in the Delaware Basin. But generally, that production and cash flow has a lot of value to us today. Tim Rezvan : Okay. And then just getting back to that number in an ideal world, how do you think about what the right debt number is, whether either in debt or in leverage terms for [multiple speakers]? Kaes Van' t Hof : Sorry, I apologize, I forgot to reply to that part of the question. I think we think about that in terms of -- two ways to think about it, right. Not only absolute debt and the leverage ratio, but also duration. And I think we obviously want less debt over time, but we feel comfortable with the amount of duration we have between now and our next maturity, which is 2026. So I'd like to take that out so that Travis won't bother me about it until 2029. And -- but when we have excess free cash flow, we are going to use it to reduce absolute debt. I think in a perfect world, a turn of leverage at a $55 or $50 oil price would be, in my mind, an ideal debt level with no debt due for multiple years before next maturity. Tim Rezvan : Okay. I appreciate the color. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks, Tim. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good day, Travis, Kaes and to the rest of Diamondback team there. Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Charles. Travis Stice : Good morning, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, this may be for you. I like the new format as well, but the -- I was also thinking about the shareholder letter. And Travis, in your prepared comments, I think you said you were hoping this format would be more efficient to pick up on a big thing for you this morning. But I was wondering also, does this -- the iteration on your communication style, I mean, does this also reflect an element of maybe dissatisfaction with how either your story is being understood or the traction that you're getting or that you maybe feel like [technical difficulty] that you're not? And if that is true or if that's the case that there's some element of it, what do you think the market might be missing? Travis Stice : No, we didn't put this letter in place trying to fix the communication issue. We've got an incredible transparency communication format that we have with our shareholders. We just thought that based on a decade of doing these earnings calls and the lack of attention really paid in the prepared remarks, felt like we could remove that. And we also know that other industries are well ahead of the oil and gas sector by not doing prepared remarks. The other thing is that we could communicate more in this shareholder letter than what we traditionally would put in a truncated CEO quote in the earnings release. And then we didn't have to have anybody spending Sunday night preparing our transcript either as well, too. So I mean, from a staff perspective, there's a lot more efficient there. So no, we did this because we think it's a better way to communicate, not that we need to improve the message or the understanding in our stock price. Kaes Van' t Hof : I think it also allows us to talk directly to our shareholders, right? Because a lot of the times, the sell side is in control and narrative and this allows us to -- so a little bit of the story behind the numbers directly to our shareholders. Charles Meade : Insight into your thinking. I appreciate that. And, Kaes, I want to go back to the question on the buybacks. I know this has been addressed at least in one other earlier question. But all other things being equal, I know I recognize they never are, but all other things being equal, is the shift to buybacks that we saw in 1Q, does that kind of signal a durable shift? Or if not a durable shift to durable change in the preference towards buybacks? Kaes Van' t Hof : Listen, I think our preference has always been to buy back shares. Now what we wanted was a governor on what fundamentally are we buying back shares for? Are we buying back oil in the market cheaper than we can buy it in the ground? And that's our NAV versus looking at a deal like Lario or FireBird. So at the end of the day, we are still going to run our NAV at a conservative mid cycle deck, which is $60 oil. And the market has presented us opportunities to buy back shares every quarter since we started this buyback program. So at the end of the day, again, our preference is buybacks, but we have a little bit of a governor on what share price we are going to be aggressive on and Q1 was the perfect example of that. Travis Stice : And Charles, we've tried to be mindful of sins of the past, our industry has been known for, which is oil price goes high, free cash flow goes up and share repurchases are done not counter cyclically like we are trying to do so, but in cycle with higher oil prices and that hasn't created a lot of value. So we may not always be perfect in the calculus, but as Kaes pointed out, whether it's the banking crisis here recently or other forms of volatility, we've had an opportunity to purchase $2 billion worth of shares back at roughly $120 a share. So we feel like we are following through on our commitment of not only being flexible in our return program, but also being mindful of the method and the timing at which you repurchase shares. Charles Meade : Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate the color. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Roger. Kaes Van' t Hof : Hi, Roger. Roger Read : Let's dig into the service cost in deflation, I guess, we could call it at this point. We haven't so used to using inflation. Can you talk to us a little bit as you think about well costs being lower in the fourth quarter, how much of that is efficiencies and how much of that is just a decline in the cost of doing something being drilling rigs or whatever? 50-50, 60-40, 80-20, something like that as well. I was curious. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I would say it's a quarter efficiencies and 75% actual costs. Now of the 75%, I would say two-thirds of that is due to raw materials and a third -- and the other third is due to the actual service piece of the equation. Roger Read : Okay. Yes, that's helpful. And then the other follow-up question I had was, is there any sort of rule of thumb approach you use as you switch to fleets? Or as you went from the zipper frac to the simulfrac in terms of how do you want to think about it, stages per day, cost per stage, something like that? Again, just trying to understand some of these changes as they get applied all across the entire complex. Kaes Van' t Hof : I will give you the cost estimates, and Danny can give you the efficiencies. I said, generally, a simulfrac fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a conventional fleet and an e-fleet is $20 to $30 a foot cheaper than a simulfrac fleet. Danny Wesson : Yes. I mean an e-fleet towards utilizing our simulfrac fleets, they're just powered with electric power that we generate on location or that we pull off the grid. So really, the savings on the e-fleet comes from the fuel consumption piece and just being more efficient on location. We do think we see a little bit of disparity between the kind of lateral footage completed per day by the e-fleet versus the diesel simulfrac fleets, but we don't have a just a ton of data yet to quantify that, but we are hopeful that over time, the e-fleets will kind of widen the gap of execution efficiency just because of the lower maintenance and R&M stuff that's required on location. Travis Stice : Danny, the difference between zipper and simulfrac in terms of footage per day yield. Danny Wesson : Yes, I mean -- so we kind of say simulfrac fleet depending on the jobs can do about twice as much lateral footage per day as a traditional zipper fleet. Roger Read : Yes. So very, very large differences. One, just a little clarification on your comments very beginning about locking in some of your electricity costs, being able to predict your LOEs a little better during the summer. Is there any interruptible risk with those contracts? I mean I'm not talking outages, which would affect everybody, but just to get the lower cost or fixed cost, you have to accept the risk of being turned off? Danny Wesson : No. It's just a hedge in the market. So it's just a financial hedge, not a physical trade. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to follow-up quickly on LOE. I just wanted to clarify one of your earlier comments. It sounds like you guys are expecting LOE per barrel decline here in 2Q and 3Q versus where you were in 1Q. Just wanted to make sure I sort of heard that right? Kaes Van' t Hof : No, we expect it to go up to the midpoint of guidance from $5 to midpoint of $5 to $5.50. So going up slightly due to third-party water handling. Leo Mariani : Okay. And you're viewing that is somewhat temporary just based on where the rigs are going to be sort of be drilling location wise here in the middle part of the year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, just dependent upon where the completions are. The completions are on a third-party dedicated piece of acreage. The cost is higher than it would have been on a prior Rattler [ph] dedicated piece of acreage. Leo Mariani : Right. Okay. And then just on cash taxes. Looking at first quarter, you guys kind of came in below the guidance. So far, I guess, quarter-to-date here in 2Q, commodity prices are kind of flat to down. You guys are expecting cash taxes to kind of increase here in 2Q per the guidance. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color in terms of how the year plays out? I mean do you generally see cash taxes increasing throughout the year? And maybe that just has to do with NOLs that are completely disappearing in your other tax shield that disappears. But -- any other color kind of around that cadence of cash taxes as the year progresses? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think the only real added benefit that Q1 had versus Q2, even if commodity prices were flat is that we closed Lario in the quarter and got to write-off some of that, the hard assets that came with that right away. Leo Mariani : All right. So it sounds like it's just M&A driven on the tax shield side and now maybe 2Q is more of a normal representative rate going forward? Kaes Van' t Hof : That's fair. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our final question comes from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : I just want to add my appreciation with the new format, I think that's great. Two questions, please. First, you've been increasing your overall activity in the Midland over the last several years. So now it's 85%, 15% between the two. Should we assume this is going to be pretty steady and stable for the next several years or that you may start to doing more [indiscernible] maybe sometime over the next 1 or 2 years? Kaes Van' t Hof : I think over the next few years, the 85%, 15% is a very fair yearly estimate. Obviously, some quarters will be higher than others. We want to continue to complete multi-well pads in the Delaware. So you have a quarter like Q1 of 2023, which was higher Delaware when Q4 was 0 wells in the Delaware. But on an annual basis, 85%, 15% feels like the right lateral footage mix. Paul Cheng : Okay. And the second question is that you talked about the budget. You feel very comfortable about the midpoint of the full year. Just curious that in that budget, how much is the cost saving or that the -- you're talking about the line of sight of the cost is coming down. How much of them is already or regionally building into that budget? Or that in other words, was that a reasonable probability, you're actually going to be below the midpoint of your budget? Kaes Van' t Hof : I don't know if I'm ready to commit to that today, Paul. We certainly have some work to do, but we have very good line of sight from an activity and a cost perspective that we've seen the peak in well costs and a little bit of a tailwind from the activity of 2 rigs coming down. Now I think that will happen a little bit in Q3 and more in Q4, but it's still early. Paul Cheng : Okay. Can you share with us that, I mean, how much of the saving your rate, generally, $1 billion? Or how much is the deflation in the second half that you have [indiscernible] into your budget? Kaes Van' t Hof : I would say if we saw more service cost deflation that would be upside to what we've modeled here. Paul Cheng : Okay. [Indiscernible]. Kaes Van' t Hof : [Indiscernible] not raw materials. Paul Cheng : Okay. [Indiscernible]. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn it over to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you for joining us this morning. I think another benefit of this new format is to allow more questions based on the amount of questions we had this morning. So, if you have any additional follow-up that you need, just reach out to us using the numbers that we provided earlier. Thanks again for joining. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to the VP of Investor Relations, Adam Lawlis. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Jules. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Good morning, and thank you, Adam. As Adam mentioned, last night we released a shareholder letter in conjunction with our press release, and this is our second quarter in a row we've tried this. I hope you find it useful. We believe that it not only increases the transparency directly to our shareholders but also improves efficiency, and those of you who have followed our story for a long time know how important improving efficiency is to us. So with that, operator, let's move right into questions, if you'll open the line. Operator : At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Morning, Travis. Guys. Nice quarter. Travis, my first question, maybe get right to it, is on service cost, and we've heard a lot of chatter about. Specifically, could you speak to maybe the current rig and frac rate environment today versus a couple of months ago? And maybe more importantly, what are you all assuming the change in cost for the remainder of the year, and how this could impact the '24 levels? Travis Stice : Neal, Good morning That's a good question. When you look at our business partners on the service side, they have always been responsive to declining and increasing rig count, and the Permian Basin rig count continues to decline. And with the discipline we're seeing across the E&P space with the reluctance to increase spending, we believe that we will continue to see a softening in cost on our -- from our friends on the service side. Now with that, that's only part of the calculus. The other part, which we view more as the variable side, we continue to drive cost out of the equation with increased efficiency. And like we talked about in May, we also see continued input costs coming down on steel, cement and other items. So it's hard to forecast into the future, but we definitely believe that we're going to see a softening in many of the costs that we've seen from the first half of the year. And we also continue to rely on the organization to do things more efficiently, which they continue to do quarter-over-quarter. Neal Dingmann : So Travis, is it too early to call any deflation for next year at this point? Danny Wesson : I think it's premature to call it deflation from where we're headed at the end of the year, Neal. I think high level, we entered the year in the Midland Basin in like in the low 700s a foot, drilling complete and equipped costs, and we'll probably exit the year in the low 600s a foot. Again, we're not calling for a cratering of the service market, we're just calling for a rationalization of it where costs certainly went up into the right for all service lines and raw materials for 7 or 8 quarters, and now that's coming back down to earth a little bit. So we can kind of enter 2024 and rest of 2023 in the low 600s per foot in the Midland Basin. That feels like a pretty good baseline for 2024. Neal Dingmann : Great. Great point, guys. And then my second question on capital spend. Specifically, it looked like you slightly increased the midstream and upstream CapEx guidance very, very slightly. But I'm just wondering, are you able to give a little color on maybe how this will be allocated both for the upstream and midstream? And then potential benefits with this slight push in cost, especially noticeable around the midstream, but I'm curious around both, maybe any benefits that we could see from this upturn? Danny Wesson : Yes. I'll start with the upstream. We drilled a lot of wells in Q2, right. We've drilled a record amount of wells, 98 wells in the quarter. That would imply we're drilling almost 400 wells a year versus guidance at 340; so a lot of pipe in the ground, a lot of -- lot of footage drilled, almost a little over 1 million -- 1.1 million lateral feet. So it was a good quarter operations-wise, which is why we're slowing down the drilling pace in the second half of the year and building a few DUCs, so that's kind of part of the main bump on the DC&E side. And then on the midstream side, we have a lot of infrastructure in the Midland Basin that most of it is -- does have extra capacity. And if the neighbor needs water or needs to dispose the water and we have that capacity, we will spend a few dollars to connect to that person. So a few unique opportunities came up in Martin County throughout the last three or four months, and we're going to spend some dollars to get a lot of barrels, and that's high payback, high-return midstream spend. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Thank you so much, guys. The first question, Travis, is just on the M&A landscape in the Permian. And maybe you could talk about, do you see a role for Diamondback to continue to be a consolidator in the basin? And then also provide an update on the asset sales, as that program has gone very well for you guys? Travis Stice : I'll take those in reverse order. If you're talking about the deals that we did earlier in the year, they've been seamlessly integrated with absolutely no issue. I will say that both of those companies we acquired were running more rigs than we're currently running now, which again continues to be the trend as you see acquisitions occur, operators that are acquiring or dropping rigs as they focus on increased profitability. The landscape, Neil, certainly relative to what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, there's just really a few opportunities out there, I mean there was a rush primarily on the private equity side to get deals into the market. And relative to what we see right now, it's very, very limited. As to Fang's roll in M&A, we have created a lot of shareholder value through M&A but our discipline has also been noteworthy as well, too. It's not important to win every deal. It's important to win deals that make us not bigger, but better, and so we'll continue to always hold ourselves accountable to that. But I'll go back to my earlier comment that relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, it's pretty parsed on a go-forward basis. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Travis, and the follow-up is just optimal capital structure. We've talked about this in the calls over the years, but just how do you think about what the optimal cash level, leverage level is for the business? And it will help us sort of calibrate the return of capital profile for Q2? Thank you. Travis Stice : Sure. The leverage obviously moves around with the oil price, but I think having a leverage ratio of less than one is appropriate for the size and scale of a company of Diamondback size. I do think also with building a little bit of cash on the balance sheet continues to make sense in order to be opportunistic for share repurchases in a countercyclical way. But those are kind of the two inputs that we build our capital structure and return model around. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, Travis and team. Both of my questions relate to CapEx. My first question is on your updated guide, you're guiding to an $80 million decline in sequential CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q, which you're pegging as the new baseline. I was wondering if you could help us understand the drivers of the lower CapEx in 4Q versus 3Q? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Arun. I would say 4Q versus 3Q is a combination of lower activity and lower costs going through the system. As you know, we're a cash CapEx payer, so we can see a few months in advance what CapEx is looking like and certainly coming down in the outlines. I would say generally, that's probably the low end of a baseline for the next year. I certainly think that a low 600s a quarter kind of runrate feels okay -- $600 million a quarter run rate feels okay for 2024. It is on the August 1, so we're going to put that in pencil and see where service costs shake out. But certainly, things tend to be moving our way from a well cost perspective. I gave some kind of cost per foot language earlier in the Midland Basin down to the low 600s by the end of the year. Still feels very achievable, and that kind of sets our targets for the upcoming year. Arun Jayaram : Great. And kind of stole my thunder here on the second question, but your 2024 outlook is to drive low single digits oil growth. I know the Street is now modeling around $650 million per quarter in CapEx, but it sounds like you're comfortable, case as we stand here today, at something in the low 600s. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I'd say that today. Obviously, still a lot of things to shake out, but I think the quality of the inventory that we have coming up as well as the high mineral interest in the core of the basin, completely undeveloped sections and units feels like a very capital-efficient plan. We've kind of been highlighting this for the last couple of years. The guide on in QEP transactions provided a lot of undeveloped inventory that we can bring a large-scale execution machine to, and now we're seeing the benefits of those couple of deals. Travis Stice : Arun, just as a reminder, we've been guiding for kind of lower CapEx all year long in the back half, and we're seeing it play out now. And as we laid out on Slide 6 of our investor deck, sort of a forecast by quarter of what that looks like. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning all and congrats on a strong quarter. Travis Stice : Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Staying on 2024, now that you've fully integrated FireBird and Lario, what is the right base level of activity that would support the 2024 outlook from a rig and frac spread perspective? Danny Wesson : Yes. I'll kind of highlight what we've done in 2023, and that feels like a good baseline for the floor plan, not forever, but how we think about capital allocation. We have a business where we can run four simul-frac crews efficiently, right? And simul-frac crew on the completion side completes about 80 wells a year. And for us, in this new business model of capital efficiency and profit value over volumes, we're focused on running the most efficient plan possible which would be that four simul-frac crew plan. Absent a major change in commodity price, that's -- the plan is the plan, and that allows the teams to plan their business and also allows us to execute at the lowest cost from a CapEx perspective. So kind of that 15-ish rigs and four simul-frac crews feels like a really good baseline for us. Travis Stice : And Derrick, just to add to that, this profitability model that we've been demonstrating now for multiple quarters in a row and the industry has pivoted to, I hope we have been able to demonstrate that volume growth is an output of efficient capital allocation that's laser-like focused on profitability. So as here on August 1, as we're entertaining questions on 2024, the volume growth will be an output of efficient capital allocation that maximizes the value for our capital allocation decisions. Derrick Whitfield : Understood. Thanks for that, Travis and as my follow-up, I wanted to touch on well productivity, which you've rightly highlighted on Page 15 as a positive. When you look out to 2024, how do you guys think about well productivity relative to 2023? And then how does that project over the next few years? It feels like you guys have a very deep portfolio that has quite a bit of stability over the next several years. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Derrick. I think generally, we feel very confident in the forward outlook for productivity. I think that's going to be a unique position in North American shale. We've been -- we timed deals very, very well, and we've made the shift to co-development four or five years ago now, and that's resulting in very steady productivity. As you can see within 1% of 2022 levels already in '23. And I would just say flat feels like the baseline, and if it's better than that, that's one for the good guys. Travis Stice : Derrick, we continue to lay out on Slide 16 in this deck what our inventory looks like. And as I look into the future, I couldn't be more confident about the long-term quality of our inventory. And in fact, that confidence in the future business plan is part of the reason that we're confident in being able to increase our base dividend. I mean that's, to me, the clearest indication from management to our owners about the future of our business and the quality of our inventory, is our ability to continually increase our base dividend. I think our quarterly CAGR for dividend increases is around 10% since we initiated it in 2018. So I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, Kaes and Adam and the rest of the FANG crew there. Travis, I wonder if you could drill down a little bit on the improved cycle times that's allowing you to increase your gross well count for the year? Is this something that's -- I can think about a few possibilities. Is this something that where you have a couple of rigs that have just increased their performance? Or is this something that's more widespread across your whole rig fleet, like perhaps a bit selection or something like that which is letting every rig just to get through the laterals quicker? What's the driver there? Travis Stice : Charles, I wish I could say it was one individual piece of technology that's transferable across our entire rig fleet, but it's much more subtle than that. And I'm going to let Danny give you some specific examples. But we get this question a lot, and it's always phrased in different ways about why does Diamondback do what they do, but the answer remains unchanged. It's the culture that we have that has an extreme focus on cost control and efficiencies. And the reason that that's important to our culture is because when we make those gains in efficiencies, those gains become permanent in part to our future capital allocation decisions, which makes us more competitive for the same dollar that's that we're competing with relative to our peers. And it's not -- again, it's not one or two items. It's thousands of items that are decided upon every one of these rigs. And look, we have a healthy competition among our rigs and completion crews that we incentivized monetarily for efficiency and cost control measures. And Dan, do you want to add some specifics on that? Danny Wesson : Yes. I think we've seen certainly our year-over-year days reduced by some measurable percentage. And what it boils down to is the team is measuring every little thing they can on the rig and measuring which way those operational metrics are trending. And when one is not trending in the right direction, they attack it with a fervor that is unlike anything I've ever seen, and that continues to output year-over-year improvements in execution. And this past month, we had a couple of wells that they've drilled at their all-time records for us for 7,500-foot laterals that were sub five-day wells for just over four days TD. And those results are remarkable, and we don't talk about individual well results a lot, but those are the things that we continue to do in the day-to-day of the company that can continue to drive our execution downward. Travis Stice : Charles, just one add to that. We just completed our quarterly reviews several weeks ago, and the teams present to us levels of details of measurement that Daniel was talking about, which is almost stunning to me, but we do it almost every quarter. And that is, they measure how long it takes to physically screw pipe together for 300 times for every trip they have to make. And in that measurement of just simply screwing pipe together in five minutes versus the next rig over that was 6 minutes, you think doesn't matter. But you do that several bit trips, bit runs per well, it adds up, and that's the level that our organization focuses on efficiency. And we have a lot of Diamondback employees listening into this call this morning, and I want them to hear that I'm proud of that work that they continue to do and deliver those results of four days, 7,500-foot wells that Danny just alluded to. Charles Meade : Thank you, Travis. It reminds me that's saying what gets measured gets done. But second question, and this kind of gets to the capital structure question. I wanted to ask how you view the decision or the trade-off between that the share buybacks and the note buybacks? I'd like to see those no buybacks, and it looks like you guys did some good prices, but sometimes that could perhaps get lost in the -- because it's not technically cash returns to shareholders, but it is a return to shareholder. So how do you guys approach that that look on buying back notes versus shares? Travis Stice : Let me talk to you about how we discussed it at the Board level. The primary form of shareholder return is in our base dividend. And we put that in place to be not only a sustainable, but a growing base dividend. And as I talked about earlier this quarter, we increased our base dividend another 5%. And so as you look into the future, that base dividend will remain of paramount importance to us, and we believe that we have that base dividend covered down to $40 a barrel of oil. So I'll just give you some confidence as to that base dividend. The second piece of the equation is share buybacks, and share buybacks are determined based on our future expectation of future cash flows and turned into a stock price so that we can measure where we want to repurchase shares back. And so you can tell from the last several quarters, the fact that we've leaned in all of our discretionary free cash flow after our base dividend to repurchase shares. And in a general sense and not specific, because everybody wants to know what stock price we're using, which we won't say until the quarter is behind us. But the lower the stock price, the more you get share repurchases. The higher the stock price, you tend to purchase less. So I hope that makes sense. And then anything left over from that calculus, Charles, is going to be distributed in the form of a variable dividend because we made a commitment to our owners that we would return 75% of our free cash flow. So I hope that makes sense. Charles Meade : Thank you for that elaboration. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Benchmark Company. The line is now open. Subash Chandra : Hi. Good morning, everyone. The first question is how you think of oil cuts going forward into '24? Is that a function of maybe the zones you're drilling or just spatially where the acreage is located? Or perhaps other factors like gas capture, et cetera? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Good question. Listen, we're allocating a lot of capital to the Northern Midland Basin where it's very oily particularly early time. I think we kind of guide people to 59%, 60% oil. I think that's probably a fairly good baseline for the next few years. In a world where we're not growing as much, that oil cut stays flat and comes down slightly because the oil declined a little faster than the gas piece. But generally, we had a couple of higher gas cut wells in the Delaware Basin in the beginning of this year that boosted the gas production as a company. But overall, kind of high 50s, 60% in a good quarter would be a good range for oil cut. Subash Chandra : Right. Terrific. And the follow-up is, I guess, on asset sales. So they've been largely midstream. How do you think the market now is for upstream assets now that oil has returned back to 80 in the bid ask? And in the cash flow statement, I think there was $140 million, $150 million of asset purchases. Just curious if that's just a flow -- overflow from the first quarter on deals announced already or just immaterial acquisitions? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I'll take that two ways. Generally, on the purchase side, we've been doing a little bit of leasing as well as a little bit of netting up. We try to make our asset teams involved in BD. They're making offers on undeveloped interests and those non-op pieces that we don't own in our development. So they're doing work there. We've been looking at leasing some of the deeper rights in the Midland Basin across some of our positions, so that's tied to some of those purchases in the cash flow statement. And then on the divestiture side, we've divested a good amount of what we deem noncore acreage and acreage that doesn't compete for capital in the next kind of 10 years of development, and have received some good prices there. I'd say we're on the sidelines more on the divestiture side today outside of what would be a very unique offer. Instead, we're more focused on the noncore midstream type divested like the OMOG divestiture we announced this earnings. We didn't increase our noncore asset sale target. We certainly have some more assets that make sense to sell, we'll just most likely be tagging along and not controlling the process. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hi guys.Want to talk a little bit about production here, so second quarter, a very nice beat versus the guidance. I think you guys said that you kind of drilled a record number of wells in the quarter. Looking at third quarter production guide, it does indicate that on a total basis, production should be down a little bit this quarter. Can you just help us kind of think through that dynamic a little bit with kind of record drilling last quarter, but production is coming down? Maybe you guys are kind of holding some wells off in terms of turning them in line until later in the year? What's kind of happening there? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Leo. I kind of see -- we kind of think about the oil guidance is what drives the decisions here at the company. I kind of see Q3 as flat to maybe up a little bit from Q2. But Q2 was a very good quarter from a completions perspective. The drilling side doesn't really drive the production profile. We were probably building a few ducts in the back half of the year to set us up well for the next year. Completion cadence was also high in the first half of the year. I think we completed 89 wells in Q2, come down to kind of 80-ish for Q3 and Q4. So I think, again, the production is the output of smart capital-efficient decisions. If this was 2017 or 2018, we'd be stepping on the accelerator and spending more capital. But instead, we're focused on generating more free cash flow in the second half of the year and returning that cash to shareholders. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on capital here. So kind of looking at kind of where you guys were in the second quarter. I mean, it looks like that's going to be the peak. So we should be expecting CapEx to come down, I guess, both in 3Q and in 4Q. How much of that is kind of related to service cost? You just talked about fewer completions in the second half, but is it really fourth quarter where you start to see maybe more service cost benefit? You talked about going from low 700s per foot start the year at a kind of low 6s by the end of the year. So are you starting to get some of that benefit here in 4Q? A similar number of completions, 80, should be down kind of a fair bit on capital here in 4Q? Just help us think of that a little bit. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think right now, we're seeing the benefits of the raw materials decreases coming through the system, mainly pipe, cement, diesel. And now, it's kind of after this call through the -- into Q3 into Q4, some of the true service side rolling through the numbers. As we mentioned, we're a cash CapEx payer, so today, we're paying for activity in June. So we kind of have a good forward outlook that that CapEx is coming down. I think the cost per foot we're seeing on wells put in the ground today is lower even than Q2, and that's all going to translate to a lower average well cost in the -- at the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys two questions, please. One of your large customers is bragging about how much is their EUR recovery way has improved or is going to improve based on the work that they are doing. Just wondering that, Travis, that in this debate, I mean, are you guys looking into that? Or that -- what does that -- based on today's technology and commodity price, is it economic for you to pursue trying to substantially improve the recoverable way? That's the first question. Second question is on -- yes. Kaes Van' t Hof : Why don't we answer the first one first. I think Diamondback is really a technology company that produces oil, and we spend a lot of time looking at improving EURs, we spend a lot of time looking across the bench-line of what competitors and peers are doing. There's not a ton of secrets in the Permian Basin, so if there is a better mousetrap, we're going to find a way to do it. I think our advantage is that we can do it at a lower cost. So generally, we're constantly pursuing, improving EURs, improving recoveries, improving technologies. You'd expect us to be on our front foot there. I don't think we're going to spend a ton of dollars testing that, but would instead be a fast follower on anything that looks to be working. Paul Cheng : Yes. I mean based on what you can see today on the technology and the current pricing, is it profitable that you pursue such activities? Kaes Van' t Hof : I don't think it's possible today. I certainly think there's some people spending money to look at it. But for us, we really want to allocate capital to the best returning projects that we have today. And that for us is high-return, multi-zone development in the Midland Basin. Paul Cheng : Great. The second question is on the lateral length You guys have been very successful, continue to lengthen it. I think the third quarter is expecting about 10,800 feet. Based on your existing land position in your portfolio, do you think that there's far more room for you to [indiscernible] is going to be able to push substantially higher than here? Or that we are pretty close to the max, unless that there's some meaningful portfolio changes? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think it's a risk-reward decision, Paul. There are certainly some areas where we can drill longer. I think -- but I think generally, the way our land position is laid out and the way our acreage sits today, that 10,000 to 11,000 range feels about right on average. We'd rather drill a 15,000 footer than 2 7,500 footers. But I think today, we'd rather drill 2 10,000 footers versus 1 20,000 footer. So I think the drilling guys can do it on the drilling side. There's no doubt about that. But it's it's a risk-reward decision because if something bad happens at 18,000 feet, that's expensive mistake. So we'd rather continue to get wells down at 10,000 feet in 8, 9 days consistently versus risking a 30, 40-day well when something goes wrong. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Appreciate everyone listening in this morning. Good set of questions. I hope you have a fantastic day. If you've got any questions, just reach out to us at the number provided. Operator : Thank you. At this time, that concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Steven. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy\u2019s third quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback\u2019s website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in Company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis D. Stice: Thank you, Adam, and good morning to everyone. As Adam mentioned, we released a Shareholder Letter last night that contains much of the narrative we hope to cover again this morning. So with that, we'll just open the lines up for question. Operator? Operator : Alright. Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Morning, Travis and team. Thanks for the time and another nice quarter. Travis, my first question is on capital allocation specifically. Several quarters ago, you suggested you all would return to more of a production growth type model, I'd call it. And I think you've mentioned when the macro fundamental supported. I'm just wondering, do you believe we're close to that scenario and wondering, why do you believe the continued high free cash flow payout is warranted? Travis D. Stice: Yes. Neal, that's a good question. Look, the world is certainly in a mess right now across any number of fronts. All of which could potentially move the markets both positively and negatively, both with the supply disruption or even a demand destruction as well too. So, obviously, we can't control any of those items. Again, we simply respond to our shareholders that own our company. That right now return a shareholder model versus a growth model, as we've intimated our plans as we look forward into next year again, look for real efficient capital allocation and as an output of that capital allocation which expect low-single-digit type volume growth. Again, not as an input, but what results from an efficient capital allocation program. Neal Dingmann : Got it. That makes sense in this environment. And then secondly on your development, couldn't help but notice the new slides on slides 10 and 11 highlighted the efficient execution and then, differentiated development. My question is, does most of your remaining Midland inventory lend to the 24 average, wells per project size that you mentioned. And then I'm just wondering, could you speak to where the largest cost efficiencies continue to come from on these projects? Travis D. Stice: Sure. On the development strategy, over time slide, which is slide 11 for those of you that are looking at it online. We tried to demonstrate our evolution from 2015 to today, and we said average wells per project is about 24 wells. I think generally that applies across our Midland Basin. However, not all deposits are equal in terms of the way the shale were laid down across the Midland Basin. So, there will be areas where we can do slightly more than 24 wells, and then areas also where we'll do slightly less than 24 wells, which usually translates to one or two wells less per shale interval. So again, it's a general representation showing the development over time. But that's a good that's a good summary. And then, let's see. What was your second question? Neal Dingmann : Just on the cost, on the cost, I know, Kaes and I've talked about, I mean, is it just on, I know you have lower casing just different, sort of raw material costs, but is there, is there other, areas in that that larger projects that are causing these, when you see that, that well productivity chart on the right, sort of what's driving the lower cost efficiencies there? Travis D. Stice: Yes, certainly. Again, referencing back to slide 10, we've laid out the biggest elements of cost savings, cost components, and the reductions over time. And again, as you pointed out, it's casing to down 20% or so. It's really, as you look into next year, we feel more of a kind of a steady state run rate on our cost. There'll be some puts and takes on both sides of the equation. Kaes, do you want to add anything? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, I think the biggest benefit to the large scale development, Neal, is the consistency of running the rigs in the same spot for a long period of time. But, on the frac side is where we save the most money from a capital perspective, because we're doing -- in some cases, two SimulFRAC crews on the same site at the same time. So, you're saving essentially, $250,000 - $300,000 a well from SimulFRAC. And now we have two of those fleets or e-fleets that run-off lean gas that save kind of another $200,000 - $250,000 of well. So, now this large scale development kind of ties to the longer cycle nature of our business, and that also means we don't want to change the plan every move in oil price. And so, we've had a consistent plan here for a few years now, and the output of that is consistent results on the well productivity per foot. Neal Dingmann : Thank you both. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Neal. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs & Co. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thanks, guys, and appreciate the helpful letter and the time today. Travis, why don't we start on return of capital as a topic talked about this in the letter of, you wanting to air on the side of caution as it relates to, buying back stock to avoid repurchasing pro-cyclically and as a result, leaned into the variable dividend in the last quarter. Can you talk about, the way that you're approaching this and how that should inform the way we think about, the split between buybacks and dividends going forward? Travis D. Stice: So, Neil, our main focus remains a sustainable in growing base dividend that we think represents the most efficient way for our shareholders to understand what our shareholder return program looks like. Following that is the share repurchase program, which we laid out the -- what we've done in the third quarter in so far in the fourth quarter. And then we honor our commitment to return at least 75% of our free cash flow by making our shareholders hold in the form of variable, which we've seen we did this year. I think the most important thing is when you talk about share repurchases is that you need to have some discipline around that because in my experience, lack of discipline leads to chasing stock repurchases all the way to the top of the cycle. So, we like most of our capital allocation decisions, actually like all of our capital allocation decisions, we hold ourselves accountable to some form of rigorous analytics, and in this case, we continue to run a NAV value at mid cycle oil prices, which is $60 oil, and calculate oil price or calculate stock price, and depending on where our stock is trading relative to that calculation, we either buy more of in the further dislocation we get from that, we buy, we increase or if not then we pivot to a share repurchase -- or to a variable dividend like we did this time around. So, again, it just it's based dividend. Its share repurchases with a degree of caution in a pro-cyclical environment and then honoring our commitment to the form of a variable dividend. Neil Mehta : Okay. That, that's really helpful. And the follow-up is just on non-core asset sales. You've done a good job of exceeding your target. Can you talk a little bit about the Deep Blue Midland Basin and JV, and then not only in terms of the proceeds, but what does it mean for your go-forward cost structure, as we think about modeling the impacts through 2024? Travis D. Stice: Yes. Good question, Neil. The Deep Blue JV was a very big deal for us. It took a long time to pull together. We had built a significant amount of midstream infrastructure over the years and spent a lot of capital doing it. And, we felt it was an opportune time to monetize that in the hands of who we see as operational experts in Deep Blue and the Five Point team. I think they have already proven to have commercial success with third-parties where maybe if you\u2019ll the Diamondback business card, you weren't going have the same type of commercial success. I think that sector is certainly ripe for consolidation as well. And I think they're the experts that can get that done. So, that's kind of why we retained the 30% equity interest in the business. We're very confident that they're going to be able to grow the business and generate a good return for our shareholders. Outside of the $500 million of proceeds we got in which is the big winner. There will be some impacts to our cost structure. I would say generally, LOE is going to be up about 8% to 10% versus prior as a company. And then we'll have a lot less midstream CapEx as we don't have very many operated midstream assets. And that'll be kind of canceled out by slightly higher well costs $10 to $20 a foot, depending on the area, as we buy water from the JV. So, all-in-all, we sold the business for a much higher multiple than we trade. And then we're excited to see what they can do in terms of creating value for the 30% that we're retaining. Neil Mehta : Thanks, team. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Neil. Operator : Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Morning, Travis and Kaes team, and Danny. Thanks for taking my questions. Travis, I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the remarks in the Shareholder Letter on being an acquirer and exploiter and just maybe putting in context sort of how robust you think that opportunity set is right now, just given the cycles in the business and some of the PE cycles that have gone through the Permian right now? Travis D. Stice: Yes, David. And I appreciate you referencing the Shareholder Letter. I tried to address that head-on. I think just in a more macro sense, we'll always do what's right for our shareholders. I mean, we've got now over a decade of what I think is demonstrating doing the right thing for our shareholders. But, we remain laser focused on delivering on our business plan, and you're right, we have built this Company through an acquirer and exposure strategy. But I think as investors are really starting to understand, we have such a high quality inventory right now, that the bar is pretty high for additional opportunities to add to our inventory that meets those the criteria that we laid out in our Shareholder Letter would sound industrial logics and being able or -- logic and being able to compete for capital right away and then being accretive on those financial measures that are so important to all of this. So, there has been a lot of private equity roll through. And I think, based on lack of our name on those, it just tells you where we view those assets relative to our inventory. Like I said, I'm really pleased with the quality of our inventory. And I think, we're executing on that in a flawless manner. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And then, maybe just for Kaes is just, the DUC backlog is built, I guess, up to a 150 by the end of the year. I think you guys talked about low-single-digit organic oil growth for next year. One, I just wanted to confirm, I guess, if that oil growth is reflecting the benefit of the increased royalty interest through the VNOM acquisition or Viper acquisition rather or if that's -- how we should be thinking about that growth rate and then just in concert with the DUC backlog are -- is it -- should we think about that flexibility, especially in this pricing environment just based on frac crew availability, or is that really just like a capital allocation decision? Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. I'll hit the organic growth comment first. Certainly we excluding the Viper deal, we expect it to grow organically. And we expect to grow organically in 2024. I think, the Viper deal provides a little bit of a jump start here in Q4, but think the team's expecting to grow off that number to steady state throughout the next year, just due to the quality of what we've got in front of us. And, on the DUC side we were kind of operating pretty close to the rigs on the completion crews and really needed some flexibility here and that the drilling team's done a really good job this year getting ahead of plan, drilling more wells than expected sooner. With these large pads and large projects you really want to have the flexibility to be able to go somewhere if something bad happens and, that DUC backlog allows that. So I think, 150 plus or minus 10 or 20 wells either way is a pretty good number for our run rate. And, we've kind of set the stage for a world where we run for the SimulFRAC crews consistently throughout the year, they each do about 80 wells a year. And, in our mind that's kind of the most capital efficient development plan we can imagine here. So, that's our backlog, just let Danny sleep a little better at night. And, allows for some flexibility heading into next year. David Deckelbaum : Good deal. Thanks for the responses. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, David. Operator : Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Yes, thanks. If I could go back to the M&A topic a little bit differently. When Kaes, Travis, when you step back and think about like where Diamondback's inventory depth is and to be a long-term successful large scale play in the Midland. Like, do you think that more large scale M&A is necessary over time? And just remind us like where you think your inventory life is, and where ideally would you like it to be? Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. I mean, I don't think it's necessary, Scott. I think we've positioned the business through both large scale and small scale M&A. It's just kind of been in our DNA for the last 10 years. I'd kind of go back to thinking about what positions in North American shale or in the Midland Basin would be envy, and there are very few particularly with where we sit today and the amount of deals we've done over the years. So, I think it's a fortunate spot to be in with the inventory duration and depth that we have relative to what's out there. I just think Travis's comment is really about knowing who you are. And this Company has been a, acquirer and exploit company that's been able to execute on acquiring and exploiting assets through our low cost structure. And, generally we have had a philosophy that the low cost operator in a commodity based business wins. And, our cost structure is what has created this business to be as big as it is today. Travis, do you want anything to that? Travis D. Stice: I think that makes sense. We've talked about the high bar for entry into the Diamondback portfolio. And, there's just, that's just how we view it. And, we're very proud of the inventory we have. And I think what goes along with that durable inventory is how we convert that inventory into cash flow. And again, you see this quarter flawless execution from our teams in converting rock into cash flow. And that's, our cost structure is enviable. Our execution prowess is unmatched. And that makes that makes a big difference when you talk about a profitable oil and gas company like that. Scott Hanold : Yes. And then and just as part of that was the inventory life kind of conversation more of like where you think you're at now and what do you think is ideal? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, I think I kind of said this that we put our next five years up with anybody in North America, and I still stand by that. I think we have another solid, five or ten years beyond that. It's very logical that at some point you're going to have to move down the quality of your inventory. We don't see that in the forward plan today, but if we retain our cost structure and our ability to drill wells $1 million or $1.5 million or $2 million cheaper. Well, as the shale cost curve goes up, we continue to stay at the low end of that cost curve. It's kind of been our mantra for 10 years now. And we started with 50,000 acres an hour at [55000] (ph). And, as that culture and mantra has not changed. And I think that sets us up well for a world, where assets are getting more and more sparse. Scott Hanold : Got it. Understood. And if I could follow-up on our conversation we had last night, just on the shareholder returns and stock buybacks. And I thought it was an conversation we had on just where it FANG\u2019s intrinsic value is now and the opportunity to grow that over time. And so, like when you step back and think about the current oil market, obviously, we're in a little bit more heightened oil price versus your intrinsic point. But, like as you see yourself progressing over the next years, I mean, does it seem to make sense that buying back stock at higher prices in this heightened market relative to what you did in the past still make sense from a value return standpoint? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, it's really all about value, like we talked about last night, if you run your business conservatively from an oil price perspective and accrete value quarterly at $75 to $80, $85 crude, if you're actually building equity value on a conservative basis, right. I kind of said last night to you that, I think generally if you run a quarter like last quarter versus the $60 base case, you're basically building $3, $4 a share of extra intrinsic value. And I think that's what we've done here over the last couple of years in this up-cycle. And, as Travis mentioned, we want to be conservative when buying back stock. We think capital is precious and capital discipline not just applies in the field, but it applies, to returning capital to shareholders. And that's why we've had this flexible return of capital program since we put it in place two and a half years ago. Scott Hanold : Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Alright. Thank you. For your question one moment for our next. Next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I think I'll skip the obligatory share repo versus a variable dividend question for a moment, and just go back to the operational aspects. So, can you give us an idea, as you mentioned, the sort of accreting value into the shares through operations, what we should be looking at over the next, say, 24 to 36 months for what else you can do operationally that'll accrete value. And thinking that we're not going to have some of the asset sales that have been going on that have certainly helped on the sort of cash flow generation assets? Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. That's a good question, Roger. No, I think it's interesting, we put it to slide in, slide 10 about operational track record in prowess and, I think we sat in this room two or three years ago saying, hey, the drilling guys, they're near the asymptotic curve of drilling these wells. Well, you look at the top left of that chart, they're still taking days out of the average well on a much bigger program, right. These guys are drilling 280 wells in the Midland Basin, two, three, four days faster than they were even two years ago. And, the culture that we built accretes that value to our shareholders. It's not something we model, but it certainly comes our way. So in the field, I think that's part of what is coming our way. I also think, generally we've tested some other zones in the Midland Basin that looked very, very good. We got a couple Upper Spraberry tests in the Northern Midland Basin that looked very good relative to our Middle Sprague Road, Jo Mill development. So, we're excited about that. I think the Wolfcamp D in the Midland Basin is starting to become a primary development zone in some of the basin. And, certainly, there's a lot of excitement about deeper zones in the Midland Basin as well the Barnett and the Woodford that we're on the testing. So I think, the Midland Basin, the [stacked bay] (ph) and the amount of oil in place, just provides a lot of opportunity for future value to accrete to our shareholders that they don't know about today. Travis, do you want anything to add? Travis D. Stice: Yes. Roger, if you back cast 10 years ago, when we first started this, we're still drilling a few vertical wells. And, I put in the letter that we released last night, just a couple of data points on a 7500 foot lateral well, which has a total depth, total major depth of about what we were drilling vertically when we started. But drilling, we drill those 7500 foot lateral wells in under four days. And when we started, we were drilling it, sometimes it'd take us over 24, 25 days to get down to that same measured depth vertically. And so, probably the most repeated question that we get, is what is the secret sauce, what is the magic that Diamondback does that allows execution quarter-over-quarter to just far exceed the competition. It's essentially, the same rock and the same tools, but the culture that we built here at this Company with that laser focus on the conversion process of rock into cash flow, is felt by every employee in the Company. And when you have everyone leaning in the same direction on cost and efficiency, as long as we can continue to give them good rock, they're going to generate the outstanding results that we're known for. So, I know that's a little bit of motherhood and apple pie, but it's -- I'm really proud of the organization for -- through all the cycles we've been through over the last 10 years, what hasn't changed is an unrelenting focus on delivering, best-in-class execution, highest margin barrels at the lowest cost. Roger Read : I appreciate that. I'm not going to be in between motherhood and apple pie here in the U.S. So, I'll turn it back. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Alright. Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Please go ahead. Derrick Whitfield : Good morning, all and thanks for all the incremental disclosures this quarter. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Building on an earlier question, how should we think about 2024 maintenance capital, run rate, assuming the benefit of deflation and your current operational efficiencies? Kaes Van' t Hof : That's a good question, Derrick. And I'd probably say that maintenance CapEx would be $100 million to $200 million cheaper, 30 wells maybe, Danny. Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. I think, we're kind of looking at it, like, our maintenance our case for 2024 is kind of a maintenance activity case. So, flat activity outfits a little bit of a growth, but, if we were to try and maintain a flat production profile, you'd probably be in the line of 20 to 30 less wells in the year. Travis D. Stice: You know, Derrick, while you're on that topic of maintenance CapEx, I might just point you to slide seven, we've had that slide in there a couple of times, but it shows maintenance CapEx, which Danny just defined, is kind of holding, the fourth quarter production flat for next year. And I just want to show you what our breakeven prices are on that slide, $32 a barrel to cover maintenance cap, maintenance CapEx, $40 barrel to cover our base dividend. So, that kind of goes back to my cost and execution comments that ultimately translate into a very protected business model even at low commodity prices. Derrick Whitfield : That's great. And as my follow-up, with respect to your non-core asset sales, how should we think about the market value of what's being retained by Diamondback and how that will be realized over time now that you've exceeded your disposal target? Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. Good question, Derrick. We do lay out some of our remaining JVs that we have on slide 26. Yes, I think some of those logically are monetized at some point in the coming years. I don't think we're in a huge rush to do so, but, in most cases, we're kind of a non-op partner to these JVs that do have a ton of value just not something that we can commit to monetizing today. Derrick Whitfield : All done, guys. Thanks for your time. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Derrick. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Derrick. Operator : Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Kevin MacCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin MacCurdy : Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary on industry consolidation. Digging into your cost structure comments a little bit, now that you've had FireBird and Lario in house for almost a year, can you comment on the level of cost synergies you've created in those transactions or maybe just share with us your analysis of Diamondback costs versus peers. I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of uplift assets get when they're incorporating it to Diamondback in your cost structure? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, that's a good question, Kevin. I hate to say it, but we didn't win those deals because we were buddies and been left and other people. So, I think we bid the most, but we bid the most because we could underwrite it with the lowest cost, right. At the time, I think some Lario well costs were near $8.5 million, $9.5 million for 10,000 foot lateral, and we were drilling them at [$6.5 million to $7 million] (ph). And so that's kind of been our mantra for a long time. I would just say generally if you split the two deals out, Lario was an execution deal because we knew we could drill those units cheaper, and execute on large scale development. I would say, FireBird is more of a technical deal. And, we had a technical view of that particular area that the basin could move further west, particularly in the northern top portion there'd be some multi-zone development that looks really good. I think we're conservative on the multi-zone potential of the central block. And now feel a little more confident about the Wolfcamp A and Lower Spraberry and maybe being wind wrapped in that area. And also, with the benefit of that block being so contiguous, we're able to bring a 15,000 foot lateral manufacturing process to that area. So, now we underwrite these deals at our cost structure, which if you look at our cost structure versus others that means we should get more of those properties at the same rate of return because of our ability to execute. Kevin MacCurdy : Great. That's only one for me. Appreciate taking my question. Travis D. Stice: Good question, Kevin. Operator : Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon of TPH & Co. Your line is now open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Travis D. Stice: Morning, Jeff. Jeoffrey Lambujon : First, one is on the ops and capital allocation side. If you can just speak to any more detail on next year's plan in terms of where you might focus within the Midland Basin, both in terms of geography, but also maybe just less active zones in terms of industry activity that you may be testing more, and if you could speak maybe a bit more onto some of that laterally in the commentary in terms of how that might evolve over the near-term program? That would be helpful as well. Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. Jeff, with these longer cycle projects we have a pretty good view of what the projects look like coming up here in 2024. I'd say generally we're going to be in the range of 11,000 feet average lateral length, probably maybe even a little bit more than that. I would say it's also a very heavy, Martin County development year for us, which is great, large scale, multi-zone development, and some of the best undeveloped resource remaining in the Midland Basin. I'd say, from a testing perspective some more wells can be probably making it into the plan and a lot more Upper Spraberry making it into the plan. We kind of have a couple really good tests and part of our culture is when something works, we implement it very, very quickly. And that's how we kind of see the shallower development picking up the pace in the Northern Midland Basin, particularly that Northwest Martin County area that we feel really good about for adding a new zone. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Okay, great. And then maybe just a housekeeping type question on the non-core asset sales side, particularly on the upstream. I think a few people noted now just how you're exceeding or you've already exceeded the target, before year end here, and it makes sense that there's no need to go out, and do more right away. But just wondering if you could speak to potential opportunities, maybe in terms of longer dated inventory that someone else might find more valuable than theirs, how do you think about opportunities that can near? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. A good question. That ties to something that Danny answered your last question. The number of wells in the Midland Basin will be kind of 85%, 90% of total capital. So, the Delaware Basin still be a small percentage of total capital. I think if I'm getting what your question is, it's what, where does the Delaware Basin sit in the portfolio. I think, for us certainly we start that area of capital a little bit here in the last few years. I think it provides a lot of cash flow and a lot of production which is beneficial to us today. But, as you've seen over the course of the year, it certainly seems like, inventory is coming in a premium. And, there may come a time where someone really, really wants to Delaware position of ours or portions of it but we're not going to sell it for [ASONG] (ph) and PD15, right, PDP. So, I think we're going to hold it for now. And if someone wants to pay for upside in a reasonable, number versus where we trade, we'll take a look at it. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Perfect. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar of Mizuho. Your line is now open. Nitin Kumar : Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Travis, I want to start on slide 11. That you've been espousing the co-development approach for some time and you show pretty solid results, and consistent results since 2020. Just curious, one of your, I guess, peers in the Basin talked about increasing recoveries by 20%, through the use of technology. You guys are at the cutting edge yourself, so I'm curious are you seeing anything out there that can improve recovery factors by that kind of magnitude? Travis D. Stice: Nitin, we keep our figure on the pulse of a lot of emerging technologies. We focus our internal expertise on improving recovery. That's not something that's on our radar screen that we're aware of today, but that's not to say that the potential is not there as you look forward in the future. There's a lot of smart guys in our industry. We have a ton of smart guys inside Diamondback, and whether that technology is developed internally or externally, it's widely communicated and quickly followed as particular that kind of result. So, we're focused on improving recovery and I know our peers are doing the same. That's not a today number for sure, though. Nitin Kumar : I guess my follow-up would be if you are a fast follower you've talked about how volume is an output of your program, your capital allocation framework, in an event that you could improve recoveries that way, would you allow, would you keep activity flat, or do you expect to reduce CapEx and just maintain that volume growth to be in the low-single-digits? Daniel N. Wesson: Yes. I mean, I think generally that would be a great problem to have. It really ties to this can you run a SimulFRAC program consistently on that position and those projects and those paths kind of goes all those back to this longer cycle nature of the shale business model. And, I think, we feel really good about four SimulFRAC crews running consistently right now, Nitin, and have the infrastructure to do that. And, if growth exceeded expectations there'll be a good problem to have. Nitin Kumar : Great. Thanks. That's it for me guys. Operator : Alright. Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning. Travis, Kaes and Danny. I want to ask one more question, but maybe from a different angle on the on the A&D outlook. Kaes, I think it was, I think I wrote down what you said that, in your prepared comments or maybe earlier Q&A, that there's very few positions out there that you envy. And so, that makes sense that you guys, your bar is high. But from my seat, it also looks like if you look at the other side of the equation, it looks like, there not a lot of positions you want to buy, but there's also fewer possible, fewer potential buyers out there, particularly for some of these large, large private positions. So, how does the -- I guess do you agree that there's fewer credible buyers some of these big packages that may still be out there. And more broadly, how's the kind of the lineup shifting is your active in data rooms and in processes buyers versus sellers? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. That's an interesting observation Charles, and it's certainly not lost on us. You've had a couple very large buyers do a couple of deals in the basin and out of the basin. They could kind of do whatever they want, it seems like, but, I would just say generally industry consolidation has happened is continuing to happen. I think a lot of the privates are gone, as you mentioned, to logical acquirers. I would just say that there may be less buyers of assets, but they're all very well-funded good operators, big balance sheets, and competitive. So, I think we just have to stick to our zones and our underwriting philosophy, which is our cost structure, our rates return internally, lot of hurdles for commodity price and usually that has resulted in more assets coming to Diamondback because you can underwrite wells drills at $1 million or $2 million cheaper. We can run LOE above cheaper, that's the kind of stuff that accretes to our shareholders. Charles Meade : Got it. Thanks for that. That's it for me. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Charles. Travis D. Stice: Thanks Charles. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to keep on the A&D theme. When we are assessing the potential of a large private or one of these unicorns to potentially consolidate, does it just come back to price, or is there something do you think that they think about in terms of the independent versus major oil business model that could be advantageous to a company with, like, Diamondback who's in Midland and again the lowest cost structures in the industry? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Arun, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about what sellers think. We just think about what is the best opportunity available for our shareholders and creating shareholder value for our shareholders. And you know at the end of the day, I think Diamondback hand on heart as one of the best positions remaining in North America and the best cost structure. And that should be a, a very winning combination for our shareholders for a long time here. Arun Jayaram : Understood. I want to maybe switch gears and just talk about the DUC efficiency gains, really surprised to see this year the drilling efficiency gains seems like the drilling efficiency gains are outpacing maybe what we're seeing on the completion side. Are you guys recalibrating the call it the rig to frac crew ratio, but give us a sense of, maybe what you're doing on the drilling side for these efficiency gains and maybe help us recalibrate what that drilling the SimulFRAC crew ratio looks like today? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. It's interesting. We really haven't thought about the rig to crew ratio in a long time because just changed so much. I think we've moved to a world where we know how many wells we need to drill and how many wells we need to complete in a year to hit numbers. And the drilling side, maybe a year ago that was 15 to 16 rigs for a full year. And now this year, in upcoming, it looks more like 14 to 15. So, the amount of work that our planning team does on the plan and how we're doing relative to plan is pretty astounding and how far ahead they are on these paths. And when we need to pick up a rig and when we need to drop it, you're really kind of just targeting, can we keep those silent track crews busy consistently? And I would guess, I guess the number is kind of in that high threes, almost four rigs to one SimulFRAC through today. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. Arun its Kaes. Our goal is to keep the drilling program ahead of the SimulFRAC fleet and just keep the SimulFRAC fleet moving in efficient just like we want to keep rigs moving from pad to pad without waiting on pack instruction or whatever. So we kind of see them as two different programs altogether, knowing that they're very dependent on each other. But I think the, the drilling and completion teams both this year have really done an excellent job of leaning in and pushing the machine to the limits and finding the little pieces of efficiency gains that can pick up. And we continue as we've always done to tinker and find better ways to execute our development strategy and build a better mousetrap. And when we find different ways to design these wells and execute that. We'll lean into it and continue to chase that the efficiency line. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning and congrats on another good quarter. I want to follow-up on Arun\u2019s question, just on the activity set in the next year. And get some more clarity on the plan for the DUCs. And so it sounds like you could be running, the 14 or 15 rigs. Will you end up drilling, 330 or so wells by running 14 or 15 rigs, or will the base plan for next year contemplate a drawdown of some of those excess DUCs? Kaes Van' t Hof : I don't think we're planning on drawing any down, absent any in the field issues. I think generally, we feel a lot better at this level of DUCs for the size of projects that we have ahead of us. Earlier this year, we were getting pretty close, that the rigs or the frackers were getting pretty close to the rigs getting off location and 20 well pad or 24 well pad or however you want to break it up, you have to have all 24 wells done before you can bring on the drilling side, before you can bring the fracture in. At least that's how we do it. And that's why that kind of 150 number, we mentioned feels like a much more balanced number going forward. Scott Gruber : I got you. So the inventory count is under normal conditions is just going up. I got it. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. This feels like a good inventory number. Again going back, we're not these aren't the days of two well pads where something bad happens, you can pull out the pad and go somewhere else. These are long cycle mini, Daniel like to call mini offshore projects given the amount of dollars that go into a project before [first oil] (ph) comes online. Scott Gruber : That makes sense. And in good detail on, all the cost trends across the various, buckets on slide 10. If you think about, going through RFP season for various services, I know you have some longer term contracts in place, but do you think you'll see any continued deflation across any of the major buckets as you go into 2024? Are those starting to stabilize now? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. I think we think, it's kind of stabilizing right now. And then for us, there really is no RFP season, right? RFP seasons every day coming back. If something's cheaper and we can do something cheaper or replace something with something cheaper, it's going to happen right away. It's not going to wait for next season or for the summer. It's going to happen now. So it's a constant RFP season here. And these are all real time costs that the team has to present to Travis on a line by line basis every quarter. And this is a real time look at where we are and where things are headed. As you noticed, we put a Q4 2023 number in there. Just to kind of show where, even we've moved from Q3 to Q4. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hey, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on 2024. If I'm kind of reading this right, it looks like you guys are talking about a rough budget next year of just a hair over $2.5 billion. Sounds like that's kind of flat activity. Just wanted to get a sense of kind of what's assumed in there for inflation or deflation? Are you just kind of assuming sort of current well costs in that number? Travis D. Stice: Yeah. I mean, we're always kind of a little conservative here, Leo. So, I would say we're kind of in the range of where we think we are today. Again, we think generally service costs have kind of modelled or flattened out. And, I've seen a major change in rig count. This feels like a pretty good range for next year. Leo Mariani : Okay. And then just to follow-up quickly on the M&A topic here. Think you guys have made it pretty clear that you want to continue to be a consolidator over time with your cost advantage. I guess at the same time, just kind of, you guys talk about kind of a $60 type of budgeting case, for oil, obviously, been above there. Is there any scenario where FANG thinks about potentially going the other way, and actually selling at the end of the day? Travis D. Stice: You know, Leo, I tried to address that a little bit in my opening comments as one of the first questions and also in my letter. Look, we'll always do the right thing for our shareholders we've been -- I feel like we've done that for 12 years now. But again, what our focus is on delivering our business plan, and we believe in our business model, we believe that there's a meaningful spot in our investment community for a company like Diamondback, and we continue to execute flawlessly. And I think I'm really confident about what our forward plan looks like. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks. Travis D. Stice: Thanks, Leo. Operator : Alright. Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. One, one of the way that to reduce costs, I think the industry is moving for the electrification. And shot at that, wondering if you can give us some idea that how far along on your process in doing so? And secondly, that with the Deep Blue, I think in the past that, you guys are very proud of your water infrastructure and all that. So is that signaling that now you have a change of view of, what kind of infrastructure need to be on by or need to be controlled by Diamondback going forward. So should we just assume that this means that you really don't think that's necessary for you to have control or to own those infrastructure. Thank you. Travis D. Stice: Yeah. Good questions, Paul. I'll take the second one first, on the midstream infrastructure. We spent a lot of money building those systems to the specs that we needed. And so, I think we're not turning over a blank canvas. Right? This is a painting that's already been, it's finished finishing touches. And so we feel confident, particularly with a lot of our field team members going over to Deep Blue to run the asset, that will be well, well served as its largest customer and also a large equity holder. So think if we were early in our development plan, might be a different story. But in this case, it's a very well built out system that is kind of readymade to turn over to them to, in our minds, do some more things commercially that we couldn't do as a standalone, water enterprise. And then your other question on electrification, know, certainly a hot topic in the Permian I think, generally electrification means both lower cost and lower environmental footprint. And that's a great thing for us in the basin. And we've done a lot of work ourselves I think the state of Texas and the utilities need to kind of do their part to get, more power out to the Permian to connect to all of us so that we can run off of line power versus different forms of generation in the field. So I think that's going to be a constant battle that we're intently focused on. And, again, it saves us money and improves environmental performance that that feels like a win. Paul Cheng : Just curious that, I mean, what percent of your operation now here has already been electric buy in, that way you think is the biggest opportunity over the next one or two years. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yeah. We've got about 90% to 95% of our current production operations, electrified, we've been the biggest opportunities we've been working on to-date, in the production operations world or been electrification of our compression fleet. And I think we're probably 70-ish percent electrified there. So we'll continue to work on getting rid of our gas, gas receipt compressors and putting electric packages, in their place. And then on the DMC side, we've got two SimulFRAC fleets that are, Haliburton, what they call their zoos fleets, are there electric fleets and we've really enjoyed the benefits of those and look forward to continuing to try and electrify the completion world. And then on the drilling side we've got, I think, five or six rigs running right now on line power, and we're continuing to put in the infrastructure that we need to run those rigs off line power, as the supply chain kind of frees up, on the back of COVID and we can get the electrical equipment we need to convert those rigs. So, it's kind of all over. But we're working on it as fast as we can and I anticipate that over the next four or five years, there won't be much of the field that's not electrified. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Alright. Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO for closing remarks. Travis D. Stice: I appreciate all the good questions this morning. I hope you find our shareholder letter constructive in in the way that we can help communicate details about our business plan. The last comment I want to make before we sign off is that we have an opportunity this Saturday to recognize all of our veterans across this country on Veterans Day, certainly for all of the veterans that are important by Diamondback, thank you for your service. And then anyone that's on the phone that also dedicated a portion of their lives to our country. I want to tell you, thank you for your service as well. And then, particularly for the Diamondback employees, hopefully, we'll see you at breakfast or lunch ceremonies that we have planned for this Friday. So thank you. You all have a great day and God bless. Operator : Alright. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the stockholders letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. So obviously a lot of the material is in that stockholders letter. So with that operator, would you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Well, good morning, Travis and team. Thanks for the time. Guys, my first question is on Endeavor specifically, just want to go back to this. You all highlighted about 344,000 acres with about 2,300 locations, that compares to 494,000, 3,800 for you all. And I'm just wondering, does this slightly smaller current core footprint provide a material amount of immediate incremental locations, Travis. And I'm just wondering or potential upside and I'm wondering how you would thinking about I know it's still a while until this thing likely closes but how you will attack these assets. Travis Stice : Yes, Neal. I mean listen, we wanted to be conservative and how we laid out the inventory counts for both us and them sub 40, I mean I think there's been a lot of aggressive inventory counts put in deals lately. And I think for us to be able to say that combined we have about 12 years of sub 40 breakeven inventory is truly a best-in-class number in North American shale and that's kind of why we put it there. I mean I think generally as with Diamondback's position, there's a lot of inventory that breaks even well above those numbers. I think there's a lot of testing going on throughout the basin. There's probably some zones like the Upper Spraberry that we'd probably call a sub 40 breakeven zone today. But I don't think they're ready to fully put it in the location count. So I think it's just conservatism. And I think on a relative basis not all locations are created equal and within that combined 6,000 location count, there's some that breakeven below 30, right. I mean it's all about what we're developing today and saving the upside for later. And we know that that upside is going to accrue to us with the size of the acreage position pro forma. Kaes Van' t Hof : Neal, just to add to that point if you think about a company's future two things are really important for the oil and gas sector. One is kind of this durable inventory in case just walked you through some numbers there. But it's also the conversion efficiency of that inventory and I think now with the announcement of this Endeavor merger, we're in control of both the numerator and denominator of that ratio. So our durable inventory greatly extends and then our conversion efficiency that we've been known for a long time actually gets to come to bear on a larger asset base. And I think to give you a little bit more color and comfort; we didn't put our thumb on the scale as we looked across the barbed wire fence. And what I mean by that is we simply applied what Diamondback is doing today on drilling and completion and operating wells and then physically adjacent. This case was just explaining, made the assumption that that can be applied across the barbed wire fence. So I wanted to give you a little bit more color there, Neal. Thanks for your question. Neal Dingmann : No, I appreciate both and I definitely appreciate the conservatives. And I think your right case has been something inflated. And my second question is on your current Slide 11 of today on the multi-zone development strategy specifically. Really like that you all for 2024 had -- sorry, for 2023 had the average project size of around 24 wells. And I'm just wondering will that be approximately the same this year? And I'm just wondering with that how do you all continue to mitigate the frac hits that seem to plague other operators so much when they do these larger projects? Travis Stice : Yes. Well, I mean I think generally Neal; the project size is up, I mean 25 is not an exact number. It's going to be different, different counties where you have different spacing within different zones. We're not -- we don't use a cookie cutter strategy to develop the asset. We use a unique development strategy for each area. I think we've had a lot of experience with practice over the years. I think we've learned and our planning group has gotten significantly better at looking around the corner and seeing what issues might arise. And certainly, there's a benefit of size and scale, right? If we have one of these 24 projects coming on every quarter, well, there's a lot of risk in that one particular project. But here we have four, five, six of these coming on every quarter. And that allows us operational flexibility to move around and plan our business. And that's just one of the other benefits of size and scale that will only be magnified with the potential with the Endeavor merger. Kaes Van' t Hof : And Neal, when you look at our 2024 budget, you kind of see that the capital efficiency shining through because we're essentially maintaining the volumes profile that we had in the fourth quarter, but we're doing so with 10% less CapEx. And as case we're just talking to our development strategy yields the same well performance. So I think as we look across the industry universe, capital efficiency for this year is going to be very, very important. And I like the way that our budget execution is shaping up in terms of that capital efficiency. Neal Dingmann : Agreed times, and seems even better next year. Thank you all. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with TD Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Thanks for taking my questions, Travis, Kaes, and team. I appreciate the time. Travis Stice : Thank you, David. David Deckelbaum : I was just curious, Travis, if you could provide an outlook. I know when you announced the Endeavor deal; I think you said that you weren't going to sell anything, obviously, until the deal closes, which makes plenty of prudent sense. But I'm interested just with all of the minority interest that you have in various pipeline investments. How should we think about just where that pipeline cycle is right now relative to investing versus harvesting? Is that something that we might see if we think about the risk for probability around 2024, seeing some of those investments being harvested? Is the market kind of ripe for that right now or you kind of expect these to be more long-term investment harvesting Endeavor? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Dave, I mean, some are -- some are able to be harvested today. Some are probably further down the line. I mean, we've done a pretty good job selling some of these non-core, we call them non-core, but equity method investments over the last 12 months. We sold the Gray Oak Pipeline interest. We sold our interest in the OMOG oil gathering JV. I think it's logical that some of our assets that we can control the sale of will likely pursue a sale, but there's others that we're probably someone who would tag along with a bigger sale, and I can't control when those happen. But it's certainly an asset that we are assets that we have on our side of the ledger that will be used to reduce debt quickly on a scale basis, or through the indefinite merger. So I think that's certainly on the table. I think Travis' point on not having to sell significant assets is important, right? When we structured the cash stock mix of the deal, we didn't want to be a forced seller of assets to pay down debt. And I think we've done that with the mix we presented last week. Travis Stice : Yes, I can't emphasize that point enough, David that we're not going to be forced sellers of any of our assets. We're going to be very thoughtful as we move forward post close in looking at monetization strategy for these minority interests, particularly relation to debt reduction. So we'll be very thoughtful and do the right thing. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate that. And just maybe a little bit in the weeds on this one, but the 2024 plan, when you lay out the Midland Basin development, this year maybe coincidentally or not, there's a more -- a little bit more on the margin going to Wolfcamp D and some of the other zones. Is that just more coincidence of geography where you're developing this year and presumably years beyond? Or are there some things that you saw in 2023 that are sort of increasing your confidence of wanting to allocate more capital there and if there's any color you could provide? Travis Stice : Yes. I mean I think both from our drill bit and from others drill bit, we've seen really good results in the Wolfcamp D. I think it makes sense to put it into the stack today, maybe not in every situation, but in more and more situations. So more Wolfcamp D in the plan, and then in the other bucket, we have more Upper Spraberry in the plan. So I think generally, if we're able to add these zones to our development plan and see similar productivity per foot, that only extends the inventory duration that we have both on a standalone basis and pro forma with Endeavor. They've been developing a lot more Wolfcamp D than us and we talked a little bit about that last week, but I think it just shows the beneficial nature of the Midland Basin and stack bay that we're adding zones like the Upper Spraberry and the Wolfcamp D that we didn't talk about three, four, five years ago and now becoming core development targets. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning, team. Thanks for doing this. I guess I have a couple pricing related questions, and the first, would love your perspective on just hedging as standalone and then also pro forma once you roll in the Endeavor assets. Historically, you talk about trying to maximize upside exposure while protecting extreme downside. Just curious what that means for you as you think about hedging in 2024. Travis Stice : Neil, I mean I think we need to protect our side of the ledger through the period between signing and closing, so we can generate free cash that reduces the cash portion of the purchase price. I think we've done that. We've historically bought funds in the kind of $55 WTI range. We now kind of stepped it up to kind of that $60 range. And we'll probably be a little more hedged on our side between sign and close than we have been in the past, closer to -- I don't know, two-thirds, three quarters hedge, so that we can make sure that, that, that cash is there to reduce the cash portion of purchase price. I think longer-term, it all depends on the strength of the balance sheet and the break-even that we have with our base dividends. We've always kind of tried to buy hedges at kind of 50 to 55. And that protects free cash flow, balance sheet doesn't blow out and the dividends well protected in that extreme downside scenario. So I don't expect us to move to a non-hedging company because we just believe that it's prudent to protect the balance sheet and our base dividend which we see like debt. Neil Mehta : Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on natural gas. I know it's a smaller part of your economics, but gas prices have been under a lot of pressure. And in the Permian, we've been surprised to see associated gas supply up as much as it is two fees year-over-year. So just your perspective on how the gas market rebalances and the Permian in particular, do you see this as a structural challenge of continued associated supply or as we move towards more oil discipline gas markets can calibrate with it. Travis Stice : I think generally, regardless of oil discipline the gas curves in the Permian Basin always exceed expectations. I think we're always pretty conservative on the gas side. And that almost universally beats expectations, which is why you're seeing on a basin level more growth than we all expect almost on an annual basis. So I think that's going to continue, Neil. We don't -- we could run the gas price at zero in the Permian and still make great returns on oil wells. For us personally, we try to protect our gas price by through hedging as well as through some pipeline commitments to get our gas to bigger markets as well as protecting our basis exposure. But generally I think the Permian, even if you stay disciplined on oil, eventually you're going to have to move to gassier zones and there's a lot of gas and associated gas left to be produced in the Permian. Neil Mehta : That makes sense. Thanks again. Travis Stice : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, gentlemen. Travis, Kaes, I'd like to know if maybe you could walk us through kind of the path to get to the $10 billion net debt target in terms of timing and how do asset sales, would that influence timing of reaching that target? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Arun, I think we kind of laid out in a $75 world generally the two businesses throughout the course of this year will combine to generate about $5 billion of free cash flow. And if we're looking at a late 2024 close, just high level, half that number $2 billion to $2.5 billion will be used to reduce the cash portion of the purchase price. That kind of puts you in the kind of $12 billion of total net debt at close and with the business continue to generate more free cash in 2025, with the numbers we laid out. You could see that $10 billion number by middle of 2025. That excludes any asset sales or acceleration, and I think we try to be an under promise over delivered company, and there's a lot of things that we can do to accelerate that outside of commodity price because I don't think we want to put the entire bet based on commodity price. So we're looking at what's available to sell down in the next couple of months here and beat that target. Arun Jayaram : Got it. And just maybe a follow-up. If you do plan to do something in the Delaware Basin, would you wait until kind of reaching close on the transaction or talk us through maybe the timing when you would contemplate doing asset sales? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think we're highly focused on deal certainty and getting the deal closed, and we're not going to do anything that derails that process. So I think the Delaware Basin is great cash flow for us, great free cash flow and a very low decline rate. And we've reduced our capital commitments there and necessary wells we need to drill for lease holding purposes. So I think it's a good asset to have for the time being and its good option value over the long run, but certainly not looking to do anything in the near-term. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Travis Stice : Thanks, Arun. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Stifel. Your line is now open. Derrick Whitfield : Yes. Good morning, all. Wanted to -- Travis Stice : Good morning, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : Wanted to start by really commending you guys for the leadership you're demonstrating on capital discipline, as many of your peers are treating the environment as if it were naturally balanced today. Travis Stice : Thank you, Derrick. Derrick Whitfield : With my first question, I wanted to focus on the service environment. In light of the collapse in gas directed activity that is underway now and the preexisting lower utilization rates the service industry experienced last year, is there an opportunity to revisit service prices on some of the higher spec equipment? Travis Stice : Yes, Derrick, good question. I think we expect that we'll see some softening in the service market this year if the gas basins do kind of remain muted in their activity levels. We are not -- we don't set the price of the service market. We're price takers. But we'll certainly continue to push on our end on finding the market prices for all of our service lines where we don't have existing commitments in place. Derrick Whitfield : Terrific. And as my follow-up, wanted to touch on Endeavor, since you guys have been out meeting with investors since the deal was announced, are there any aspects of the transaction that are underappreciated in your view? Travis Stice : I think the first question that came up was on the synergies of the $3 billion worth of synergies, most of those underpinned by our existing cost structure, applied to the Endeavor assets. And so those are usually the entry questions. But once we explained that the cost assumptions that we embedded are the same cost assumptions we're currently doing today, a lot of comfort was gained, and then we went to the more kind of strategic questions with the shareholders. So I think probably the cost efficiencies were the first, and then secondarily, were some of the debt retirement strategies that case just went through were probably the two most topical questions that we dealt with. Derrick Whitfield : Terrific. Thanks. Great quarter and update. Travis Stice : Thanks, Derrick. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Derrick. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I just wanted to come back, you talked earlier about some of these other benches that might work, and it's a question of whether they'll be as productive and efficient or the productivity and efficiency in those benches. Give us an idea of maybe some of the, let's call it science or just applied efforts that you're seeing that can open up some of these other benches. And I'm thinking within your footprint, as well as what will be an expanded footprint here before you're in. Kaes Van' t Hof : Roger, I mean I think for zones like the Wolfcamp D, we've had some testing on our assets, but also seen a lot of results across the fence line. Diamondback doesn't spend a lot of time. We spend a lot of time looking ourselves. We also spend a lot of time looking across the fence line at what other people are doing, either through M&A process or just general competitor analysis. And we've seen that the Wolfcamp D has been very competitive, particularly in that kind of Midland Glasscock County line area. And also, as you get into Southern Martin County, so that's getting more attention. I would say the Upper Spraberry, we've done a lot of work on ourselves, actually, an old energy well drilled in the Upper Spraberry in 2016 or 2017, and we revisited that well recently, last year, and some of the Upper Spraberry wells that we've completed, one in particular is probably one of the best wells in our portfolio. So I'm not ready to say that the Upper Spraberry exists across our entire acreage position, but it's certainly getting more capital and attention this year, and particularly with the co-development strategy and the fact that these zones talk to each other in some form or fashion means we've got to get it now. And so we've added the Upper Spraberry into our kind of Northern Martin County development plan. And I think the results speak for themselves because you haven't seen a degradation in productivity. I think that's the key to this exploration resource expansion story is, if you can expand your resource without impacting productivity, that's a win for our shareholders. Travis Stice : Roger, I'll just add a comment from a high-level on what Kaes just mentioned. In my experience, as companies get bigger, the more inwardly focused they become. So they focus more on their own results and less on what others are doing around them. And it's been a hallmark of Diamondback since the very beginning. One, you could say, out of necessity when we first started, but it's been a hallmark of ours to really pay attention to what goes on around us. And so right now, it's culturally ingrained not only to rigorously examine our own internal results, but also spend intellectual capital on looking across the barbed wire fence at what others are doing. And as we move into a much larger position post close, I promise you that culture will stay intact. We will continue to look and find what others are doing potentially better than we are and adopt accordingly. Roger Read : I appreciate that clarification. That's my only question. Thank you. Travis Stice : Thanks, Roger. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Co. Your line is now open. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the time. Travis Stice : Hey, Jeoff. Jeoffrey Lambujon : My first question -- hey, my first question is on the step change in capital efficiency you are looking forward to into 2025. Could you talk more about the pathway there? I know you're already there for the legacy portfolio of, well cost, as you mentioned, Travis, but can you comment maybe on the larger buckets or moving pieces you'll be focusing on the Endeavor side, both in terms of that well cost reduction and in terms of the non-DMC line items that you think about as we shift from this year into next. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Jeoff, I think generally there's two big buckets on the DMC side that we see across fence Endeavor that we'll probably look to put in place with the team there as we start to integrate on the completion side, it's really the SimulFRAC development plan, as well as probably half of that plan being a SimulFRAC e-fleet, which only reduces the cost of the completion side of the business. I don't even think we've modeled the benefits of a much larger supply chain to these numbers. This is just us getting their cost down to our costs on the capital side. So there's probably some upside there at some point. And then on the drilling side, we've been a big proponent of clear fluids not using oil based mud to drill these wells. It saves time and money. That was something we put in place and learned from the QEP team three or four years ago. And so I think that's just a decision to make. That saves significant dollars. And what I'm excited about is to get under the tent with the Endeavor team and learn what they're doing that we can do better, right? I think that's not modeled in this pro forma business. And we've learned something from both energy and QEP are two large mergers that we've done to-date. So I think there's some upside there. But really, all we're doing is looking to put in place what we're doing today on a larger asset base. Travis Stice : And, Jeoff, since I spoke just a second ago on some of the cultural elements of Diamondback, another cultural element is when we combine assets in our history, we've done a really good job of checking our egos at the door and finding out what's really working. And it's a culture of seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood. And as Kaes just mentioned, when we put the two companies together, we're really excited about understanding what they do, why they do it, and making -- collectively making improvements both on our side and on the incoming asset side. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Perfect. And then for my follow-up, I wonder if you could just speak to how the philosophy around the balance sheet longer-term will evolve, if at all, once the deal closes. We appreciate the commentary on the path to get to the $10 billion net debt level, but we're just thinking about how the pro forma math continues to push Diamondback to new levels in terms of weight class within the space. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean that's a question we got on the road a lot last year, kind of from investors saying, hey, listen, you're in a different weight class now, and you probably need to reassess your long-term leverage profile. And I think that resonated with us and fits with what we're trying to do. I think we eventually want to get to kind of a $6 billion to $8 billion net debt number, keep real cash on the balance sheet. I think the concern that Diamondback is going to go do every deal and use all cash to do deals has probably been removed with this merger. And in my mind, that leaves us flexibility in terms of capital allocation to lean into a buyback in a down cycle or lean into an acquisition in the down cycle and be -- be pro cyclical -- not be pro cyclical in how we look at allocating capital on the repurchase side or the deal side. So long-term, $6 billion to $8 billion would be a good number. If it gets to zero, that'd be great. But I think generally running in that half a turn at strip is a pretty good place to be. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great. Appreciate the time. I have to turn it back. Travis Stice : Thanks, Jeoff. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Jeoff. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Last week when you announced the deal, you gave the 2024 and 2025 CapEx pro forma and also the [indiscernible]. It was 2005 the pro forma compared to 2004 with the above say call you wrong number $700 million lower. Can you breakdown that how much relation because you think the antipathy will be lower or that asset because you're not going to grow as fast and how just truly is just -- Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Sure, Paul, you kind of cut out a little bit, but I think I get your question. Question is, how do we bridge the gap between the combined 2024 CapEx guide with us and Endeavor separately, and the combined business in 2025, which is down $700-ish million? I would say most of it is running our cost structure on the Endeavor DMC. And so that's basically 175 wells at $1.5 million, $2 million cheaper, it gets you to about $300 million. I think combined business is not going to need as many wells to hit the production number. Endeavor was growing last year. They started slowing down mid-year, but their decline rate is shallowing. So that'll help. Our decline rate continues to shallow. That'll help. I think we're going to allocate capital to the best combined resource probably in North America, which will help. And so that kind of gets you to needing probably 50 less wells at $6 million, $6.5 million a pop. That's about another $300 million. And I think generally we're spending some dollars this year, probably about $50 million on environmental CapEx. That is kind of one-time in nature and will be reduced on our side as well. So you put all that together and that's a very, very capital efficient business in 2025, assuming existing well costs, and that can move around. But that's how we're thinking about 2025. We might have lost Paul. So we'll go to the next question. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask about the Endeavor FANG combination here. Do you guys see any tax benefit for the combined entity where you might be able to defer some of the cash tax payments as a result of combining these two companies? Have you had any preliminary look at that? Kaes Van' t Hof : I mean there obviously be some benefit with the cash portion of the transaction and the associated interest expense, but we're continuing to do our combination work. I mean we're a full cash taxpayer, essentially. I mean they're pretty close as well. So I don't think there's going to be too much to do there, Leo, but certainly, the cash piece is going to shield a little bit of taxes on our side. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just jumping back over to M&A, obviously you guys got the big prize and the Permian, and the market has clearly rewarded the Diamondback shareholders here. As you look at kind of the remaining landscape, do you think there's anything out there left to do that's kind of chunky that would be of interest to FANG? Or is it maybe just kind of more little stuff over the years to kind of tie everything together? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Listen, Leo, we're on the sidelines here. We're fully focused on getting this deal closed as soon as possible and we can assess the landscape when that happens. I mean I am confident that the landscape will look different whenever that time does come. Leo Mariani : Okay. Thanks. Travis Stice : Thanks, Leo. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open. John Abbott : My question is, does that have any impact on integration, planning, or does that go ahead anyway. Kaes Van' t Hof : Hey, Doug, you have to speak up. John Abbott : This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Apologies I was on mute. Just one more, just one question going back to Paul's question on the difference in CapEx between 2024 and 2025. That's about $725 million. And then you talk about the $550 million in synergies. So when we think about that $725 million is there an addition on top of that, as were we sort of thinking to 2025? Just sort of trying to reconcile the two numbers? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think the difference between the two numbers is really activity between the $550 million and $725 million, right? The combined business has less activity in 2025 versus 2024, which is helping, but we kind of see the $550 million as more of a longer-term run rate, John. John Abbott : Appreciate it. And that's really it at this point in time, but thank you very much for taking our questions. Travis Stice : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Great. Thank you. I really appreciate everyone listening in this morning and asking questions. And if there's any follow-up, just reach out to us and we'll address them then. Thank you. And you all have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thanks, Jose. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback Energy's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and letter to stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van\u2019t Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation of the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining again this morning. I hope you continue to find the stockholders' letter that we issued last night in an efficient way to communicate. We spend a lot of time putting that letter together, and there's a lot of material in that. So operator, with that as a brief introduction, would you please open the line for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : A lot of good stuff in the letter. Two quick follow-ups. First, just on natural gas. You spent a lot of time talking about some of the steps you've taken to mitigate some of the softness that we're seeing in Waha pricing. Can you spend more time on that? And as it relates to that, how do you think about the timing of debottlenecking Permian gas? Travis Stice : Well, from a macro perspective, I think we've been pretty clear that we're going to continue to need pipes being built about every 12 to 18 months out of the Permian to accommodate the associated gas that goes along with just 6 million barrels a day that we produce out here. Natural gas is right now being almost like a waste product, and we've got it. This -- when matter workup zone this fall, we'll see some of that reverse. But Kaes, do you want to give them some description of what we're doing in the rest of the gas? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neil, I mean, this will be long term, we want to be able to contribute to more pipes. We've done that in the last couple of years with commitments on Whistler and  Matterhorn. We've relinquished taking kind rights in other areas to commit to other pipes that were built. As Travis said, we just need to do more. And I think with our size and scale and balance sheet, we should be taking a leadership position on these new pipes. We've talked to a lot of people that are working on them today, and it seems that there are projects in the works that will help the bottleneck past the end of this year. But as we control or have the ability to control more gas flows on our side, as contracts roll off, et cetera, we're going to keep pushing on more pipes and more markets out of this basin. Neil Mehta : Yes. And then the second is capital efficiency. You talked about the 10% improvement that you're expecting per lateral foot. So just talk about what you're seeing real time in terms of deflation. And then also, what are those the next steps in terms of driving your cost structure lower as we think about efficiency of fleet? Travis Stice : Well, I think the deflationary pressures we continue to see in the Permian are being driven by the decline in the rig count and the decline in the completion crew count. Those will be tailwinds for us as we look through the rest of this year. But also without regards to those deflationary impacts, we continue to push the envelope on our D&C operations where we're getting -- I think we averaged almost 13,000 feet for the quarter this year, and we continue to get these wells drilled faster and then our completion crews continue to push the envelope on the number of lateral feet that are completed in a 24-hour period. So we're working on the numerator and the denominator of capital efficiency and really like the way the rest of the year sets up for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun  Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. Arun Jayaram : Travis, you and the team had highlighted up to $550 million of annualized synergy capture in the transaction in the Midland Basin, including a 150-foot decline. And do you see any cost in the Midland Basin to that $600 million to $650 million range? Maybe a follow-up to Neil's question, but where are you seeing kind of leading-edge cost today in the Midland Basin as you continue to push those lateral links a bit longer? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, this is Kaes. I think the combination of those longer laterals, 12,000-plus with some efficiencies on the completion side that we probably weren't expecting going into the year as well as some softening on the service side makes us feel pretty good that we're in the lower half of that $600 to $650 a foot in the Midland Basin. As you know, 90% of our capital is being allocated to that basin. So with those costs trending in the right direction, I think on a real-time basis, closer to $600 a foot, we feel really, really good about our plan this year as well as carrying that momentum into a Q4 close. The Endeavor deal and into 2025. Very clearly, we laid out some strong synergy targets and a very strong capital-efficient 2025 plan, and we still feel very, very confident in that plan. Arun Jayaram : Great. Kaes, looking at the quarter, you didn't really -- how many activity in terms of [ TILs ] in the Delaware Basin. Can you give us some thoughts on the Delaware program? I know it's 10% of the program, but what's your thoughts on the Delaware as we think about moving on into the back half of this year and into next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Listen, there's still a place for the Delaware program. There are still some really good projects coming up in Q2. I think we have a project in that Romeo area, Northern East County that's going to be very good. I think generally, with large pad development, you're going to see pockets of development in the Delaware rather than consistent development because we want to go over there and complete multiple wells, multiple pads in a row and keep that capital efficiency high versus the Midland Basin where 3 or 4 simul-frac crews are going to be running at all times. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Maybe this question is for both of you guys. But considering the positioning a bit early with the debt that you raised earlier this month, now the expectation that the deal will close at the end of the year with Endeavor. You talked about kind of the synergy expectations in the last series of questions. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that initial sort of noncore sale asset target and maybe some of the updated timing around those thoughts, considering the market's changed a bit, especially around the cash consideration portion? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think what's changed is just timing, right? I think the projects we see as noncore asset sales or the asset sales to subsidiaries we have is still the same. Endeavor has a really good midstream business that would fit well with our midstream JV. They have a significant mineral business that I think is going to be a game changer for Viper if those 2 businesses are combined. And our strategy to execute on those trades has not changed. It's just been pushed out to the right. So on top of that, there's an $8 billion cash consideration, that continues to be worked down with free cash flow between sign and close. I think that just means, we have to pony up less cash at close in Q4. And we raised the money a couple of weeks ago because we were preparing to potentially close the deal as early as today. Unfortunately, the deal has been pushed out due to regulatory review, but we had to be ready to fund the deal, and that's where we were. Fortunately, the bond deal was pretty well-timed. We're actually earning very minimal negative carry on the cash that we have sitting at the banks today, and we'll be ready to use it when we close in a couple of quarters. David Deckelbaum : Maybe just to follow up a little bit more on just the gas pipeline side. Just for my own edification, just some clarity. Just you highlighted you didn't have any issues with egress. You have Matterhorn coming online in the third quarter. Is there a point as you look forward, where you anticipate egress issues? Or is this more appearing to be just more proactive to get involved with taking on firm capacity in future pipelines? Do you need to take a more active role beyond that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Well, I mean, we're facing them right now, egress issues, right, not on the physical side, but it's really on the price side. So I think if we can remove the pricing aspect of pricing modules in Waha versus pricing them further downstream and just paying a fixed fee on the pipe. That to us is a risk mitigation strategy that makes sense for Diamondback shareholders. So I think we see the gas forecast continuing to increase. If you do look back the big public third-party services and what they thought gas production was going to be in 2024, they've all been wrong. So it's always been more gas sooner. And so for us, we need to handle that physically where we can. And with our balance sheet and size and scale, we can sign those 10-year deals because we know we're going to be around to produce for a very, very long time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Scott Hanold : I'm just going to stick on the gas team as well because it is very topical, but it sounds like, and just correct me if I'm wrong, you guys feel good about your development program on a Diamondback stand-alone basis as well as with Endeavor with gas capacity, at least for the foreseeable future and just confirm that's correct? And if you could also maybe opine on just broader Permian in general, do you expect other operators to see some physical constraints not being able to get their gas out and potential shut-ins related to that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Scott, we're 100% confident in our plan. I think we have a lot of visibility. We have more and more physical space coming our way. Every molecule is moved to date. I don't like the speculation blame game in the Permian about who's going to be able to move or not. I'm focused on Diamondback, and we're going to be in really good shape. Scott Hanold : Okay. Fair enough. And then my next question is on stock buybacks. Obviously, it sounds like it's going to be a little bit more tempered until the deal closes with Endeavor, but can you give us your thought process on buybacks post-merger and how you think about the intrinsic value of the combined company? And what mid-cycle price makes sense to underpin that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think philosophically, part of the move back to 50% of free cash flow returned every quarter allows us to build more cash, pay down debt faster, but also make the bigger bets on buybacks, right? In a single quarter, if you're having to distribute 75% of your free cash flow, you don't get to really make the big bet on the buyback at the right time. And so this flexibility will allow us to do that. Clearly, we've been a little limited on buybacks since announcing the deal. I would expect that to stay about the same here in the second and third quarters depending upon the market. If we see some weakness, we're going to step in and support the stock. But longer term, we want to make the 9-figure, 10-figure bets on buybacks at the right time, and that's the flexibility we want on capital return. I think we still see kind of mid-cycle in the $60 to $70 range. I think we were firmly 60 for a long time. We're probably closer to $70, $20 and $2 or $3 gas. And in the combined business, you look at what we have with Endeavor, there's a significant amount of inventory and a lot of NAV accretion. So -- and probably a lower combined cost of capital. So I think we feel like we can raise that buyback up a little bit, but we're probably going to be cautious until we close. Scott Hanold : Yes. Just to clarify a couple of points. Just broadly speaking, how much accretion do you all feel Endeavor added? And can you give us a sense of like when you think about cost of capital, like what were you kind of thinking before when you did intrinsic value. Was it like a 10% kind of flat? Or do you get a little bit more scientific with that? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. We've always been a little higher than 10%. I think in after-tax [PV-12] felt like at a mid-cycle price, felt like a very conservative price to buy back shares. And that also makes sure we don't get trapped into a positive feedback loop of buying back shares all the way to the top. So I think an after tax, 12% rate of return in this business is a really good rate of return at a mid-cycle price, and that keeps you in a good spot through the cycle. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Roger Read : Yes. I'd like to come back on the, let's call it, efficiencies and lower costs. Obviously, some part of that, as you mentioned, was service competition, rig on rig, crew on crew lowering costs. But if you look at the underlying improvements you cite e-fracs over a diesel frac, kind of where do you think we are in terms of running through continued efficiencies there as we, let's say, alter the equipment, maybe alter the methods of doing some of the wells and with the danger of crossing the line here to post Endeavor, kind of what you see as maybe a year or 2 out in terms of continued efficiency gains. Daniel Wesson : Yes. Good question. We are continuing to drive costs out of the business through our operational plan and execution. On the completion side, A lot of that's going to come in the way of getting any fleets off of generated power and on to some form of grid power where we can recognize a lower energy source cost. We're continuing to try to drive days out of our execution, and we're kind of on the asymptotic slope of that efficiency gains that we are getting to a point where the fixed cost of the wells are a significant -- significantly larger portion of the cost of the well than the variable cost. So we're getting to a point where the variable costs that we're going to impact our pennies and nickels and not as much the dollars anymore and to get those large chunks, we're going to have to think about doing things differently as far as the physical plan for the wells and what we are going to consume as part of the fixed cost of the wells. Travis Stice : Roger, I give our guys some joke with them a little bit on the drilling side because they're almost to the point where they're spending more time screwing pipe together and unscreen pipe together than they are actual rotating hours and the lateral, not quite, but they keep certainly pushing the envelope. And really, if you go back to what we said during the acquisition announcement with the merger announcement with Endeavor, we talked about $150 a foot. $100 of that foot was from just simply going to a simul frac and the other $50 a foot was going to clear fluids. And really, that's what we're doing today. So we emphasized at the time. That's not a big stretch. It's just simply doing what we're doing today on a new set of assets. And in Dan's comments, we're spot on as well. Roger Read : Got you. So we just need somebody to come up with the next better mousetrap out there for the step functions. I appreciate that. Kaes Van' t Hof : Listen, Roger, one other comment on that. I mean the guys are so good on the drilling side now. They're measuring how thick the threading is between casing and on the drilling side to say, \"Can I screw that pipe together half a second faster versus what I used to do.\" I mean it is down to the absolute second on-site to reduce those variable costs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. John Freeman : Just following up on these efficiency drivers. Obviously, in the quarter, the wells that you all completed, the 101 wells, they were right in line on the lateral length of what your guidance was for the full year around that 11,500 feet. But obviously, you all point out the 69 wells that you all drilled in the Midland Basin that were significantly longer than that over $13,000 a foot, obviously, first-class problem given the capital efficiency you're seeing on these longer laterals. But should we still use that full year guide of 11,500-foot average for the year? Is that still applicable? Or should we consider that probably moving up relative to the original guide? Daniel Wesson : Yes, John. I think in the first quarter, those longer laterals were really just a function of where we were completing the wells that average lateral length of 11,500 is what we expect to see for the rest of the year. John Freeman : Okay. And then just shifting gears a little bit on the topic of, I'm trying to get a sense of like how much you are able to do sort of in advance of the Endeavor deal closing. And I know that in those initial efficiencies that you all laid out, things like, maybe pricing power supply chain, things like that weren't even necessarily priced into those initial synergies. So I'm trying to get a sense of like how much can you all do in advance in terms of negotiating with some of your service providers in anticipation of sort of a larger combined entity buying in bulk, things like that, like how much of that, if at all, can you do in advance or you just kind of have to sit and kind of wait until the deal closes to kind of get running on that stuff? Travis Stice : Yes, John, we got to operate as separate companies until the deal closes, and those things will come to the benefits of the combined company, but certainly can't influence any outcomes until deals were closed. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Travis, my question for you, okay, is just on the marketing side. You are looking not only from a capital efficiency, but it seems like from a takeaway, you all continue to get better and better sort of realized margin. I'm just wondering, now with the larger size, or I guess when that closes, what type of benefits will you continue to see the benefits on the back end that you've been seeing on the company? Because it seems like noticeable that a lot of your margins and all just on the marketing side continue to improve. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neal, I mean, I think -- I don't think we're going to see much more improvement. I think it's -- for us, it's more about risk aversion, right, and having our barrels and molecules go to different, bigger markets downstream. So we have a lot of oil that goes to the Gulf Coast in Corpus and is exported. We now have a good amount of oil going to Houston feed refineries there. So I think we've kind of grown up as a company in terms of marketing. And very clearly, mistakes for May 5, 6, 7 years ago when the Permian got tight, and we're just not looking to make those mistakes again. So with our size and scale, we're going to be contributing to oil pipes, contributing to new gas pipes. We've made some investments in gatherers and processors and many midstream investments throughout the years here that 1 made our shareholders' money on the investment side, but to protected us on the commercial side. So I'd expect that trend to continue as we get bigger. Neal Dingmann : That Kaes, you're saying you'll continue to contract more of those longer-term marketing contracts then? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I think our philosophy is to get our barrels to the most liquid bigger market and very clearly, selling within Midland or in the Midland market has not always been the most beneficial to our shareholders. There are pockets of time when the Midland market is very loose, but there are also periods where it gets very, very tight. So the way we see this physical marketing protection is a long-term insurance policy to make sure our barrels move to the right market. Neal Dingmann : Okay. And then just quickly on project size. You all continue to do a fantastic job not only that you have the larger projects, let's call it, on average, 6, 4-well pads, things on that nature, but you seem to have the flexibility that the larger and oftentimes the majors don't on those projects. Will that continue to be sort of the standard for you all going forward on these larger projects where -- and you'll maintain that flexibility or maybe you could just hit on that briefly. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean you can go on for hours about that. I mean, that ties the culture, right? And our biggest benefit at Diamondback is that we have a small company dynamic culture with a large asset base that's now growing larger. So we are going to have to make sure we maintain that gritty quick, fast-moving adaptive culture to a larger asset base. I'm fully confident that we have the exec team and employee base to both at Diamondback and Endeavor to do that. And I think these big projects, there's a lot of capital being put in the ground before first oil sometimes upwards of $250 million, $300 million, but as long as you have the ability to move crews and rigs within a quarter, within a year, keep hitting numbers, we're going to keep doing that at a larger scale. Travis Stice : And Neal, as we built this company over the last 10 years, we've always maintained a couple of constants. One is the fact that we keep a real flat organization. And we keep a non-siloed organization as well too. And the only way that you can grow an organization and maintain that effectively is to have an unreasonable level of trust. And as we encourage our -- the Endeavor employees to come over, we're going to be demonstrating this high level of trust because it's going to be a very important part of our evolving culture as a much larger company. But those 2 things will stay the same, flat organization, no silos. Neal Dingmann : Look forward to the new assets, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Whitfield of Stifel. Derrick Whitfield : Congrats on another solid brand. With my first question, I wanted to focus on the second request from the FTC at a high level. Art Research indicates that most of the larger transactions have received that. Is that consistent with how you're thinking about it? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, that's consistent. Derrick Whitfield : All right. Terrific. And then shifting over to ops. So during the quarter, you completed 3 additional Upper Spraberry wells.  Based on those results and some from last year, could you speak to how the interval competes in your portfolio and if it's likely to get added to your inventory charts on Page 21? Daniel Wesson : Yes, Derrick. We followed up this year with -- in Q1 with 3 additional Upper Spraberry completions kind of following up that success that we had in the North Martin area with that first test. And we really like the initial results from those wells. And I think that from a cost perspective, we're seeing those costs be pretty competitive. And I think we'll probably look at adding that development to subsequent developments in the future. Kaes Van' t Hof : I think to fill this up to the top of that, Derrick. If you start to add in zones like Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D, we've got some really good Wolfcamp D tests in some of those same pads. If you start to add those in and you don't see degradation on a corporate basis in terms of the cume curves that everyone looks at so closely every year. That's inventory extension in our existing asset base. And with the combination of us and Endeavor, adding in zones like the Upper Spraberry, Wolfcamp D into full-scale development, only extends the duration of what we can do here in the Midland Basin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Travis, is that in your presentation, you have an interesting statement on the ESG, you intend to eventually invest in income-generating projects that are expect to more directly offset remaining Scope 1 emissions. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how big is the kind of investment? Are you expecting that to become a new division or that a new business for you? Or that is -- when it is going to be pretty small scale and result pay over the too much attention on that. That's the first question. The second question is interestingly that the E&P producer, no one really talking much about AI, but the service provider, now it's number they start to brand about say, how AI is going to drive their revenue and it's going to allow the improvement of EUR and productivities -- of the well productivity. So just curious that is Diamondback, you guys have been always do a lot on the technology. Have you tested on the AI application and whether that you see that going to be meaningfully change your EUR or your well productivities. Travis Stice : Well, the first emphasis on AI has been not degenerative AI, but using AI to process data information a lot quicker. And so, look, we're really excited about the long-term implications of AI on our industry, whether that translates to improvements in AUR or improvements in efficiencies or hopefully both, I think, is yet to be determined. But it's one of those things that we're trying to be fast followers on. This is arena of our industry that's moving incredibly fast. These electric frac fleets that we're using right now actually are accumulating more information than we can process. So we're storing some of that information and hoping to use smart algorithms or AI to help us process that information in a more usable and more real-time fashion.  Kaes, this first question was the income-generating tech to offset that. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean we have a subsidiary snake company called Cottonmouth Ventures, that's kind of our new ventures snake, I'll call it. But it's not a huge business today. I think one of the more exciting projects we're working on is with our Verde Clean Fuels partnership where we are in the scoping phase of building a plant, a gasoline plant in the basin that's going to be tapped into one of the pipelines that we are participant in. That plant will convert 35 million cubic feet a day of gas -- natural gas, lean gas into 3,000 barrels a day of gasoline. So that, I think, fits our model of, if we can contribute molecules and expertise to a project, not just capital, but the other things, to drive value. We're going to look at it. I would say that project might FID by the end of this year and be up and running in a couple of years, and that might be a good little offtake for 35 million a day of gas. And if it works, we're going to build more of them. Travis Stice : Paul, when you look at the capital program, it's going to spend between $4 billion and $5 billion a year on a pro forma basis. The percent of that, that we're going to allocate to income-generating projects is probably pretty small and that in an individual sense, it will probably have a larger impact, but I wouldn't expect it to move up to the noticeable level on a company that's spending between $4 billion and $5 billion a year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH MKM. Leo Mariani : I just wanted to touch base on sort of activity cadence this year. It looks like you guys had kind of 89 first quarter completions, all in the Midland, but that's a pretty healthy percentage, about 32% of your full year budget on completions.  Is there some anticipation that maybe some slowdown as the year goes and just seem like a quicker pace than I expected here in the first quarter. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Leo, a couple of things. I think we're having a pretty good end of the year last year into Q4, and so we pushed completions into Q1. So Q1 looks a little high relative I think generally you can think about that 70 to 80 overall completion a quarter as the base case. Q2 might be a little towards the high end there. But because we're a little bit ahead of plan in terms of efficiencies and timing we're probably going to reduce our frac crew count by 1 for a period of time over the summer as well as kind of get down into that 12, 13 rigs on the drilling side to complete -- to drill the same number of wells. So we look at the plan almost weekly with the planning team. And I think, generally, the efficiencies have led to less overall activity, more capital efficiency and setting us up well for this potential close here in Q4 with Endeavor. Leo Mariani : No, that's helpful color. And then just shifting over to asset sales. You obviously talked a little bit about sort of when the Endeavor deal closes, maybe moving some midstream assets into your Deep Blue JV and also a drop-down to Viper. Outside of some of the Endeavor-related asset sales, is there anything else that you guys are sort of working on. You talked about raising cash for, just from free cash flow here over the next handful of months until the deal closes. But just trying to get a sense if you guys are looking at other asset sales in the interim. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Not many. We sold a piece of our Viper ownership in the first quarter, and that plugged another $450 million of cash on the balance sheet. And I think I'll go back to when we structured this deal. We certainly do not want to put so much cash into the deal with Endeavor that we had to be a seller of assets, and that's exactly what we've done. Now I think we've had some price help here in the last couple of months that has boosted free cash flow and reduced the cash portion of the transaction. And listen, I think the price has got to be right for any asset sale, whether it's the Deep Blue, Viper or otherwise. And we're going to be patient post-close. I do think those assets make sense in other hands, but it's got to be the right value. Leo Mariani : Okay. That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask about your production kind of severance tax here. You give the guiding to kind of 7% of revenue. It's kind of come in below that the last handful of quarters, closer to 5% to 6%. Just wanted to see what was kind of going on there. Maybe that was kind of anomalous in the last handful of quarters and 7% the right number going forward? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. It was just higher than that before then, a couple of quarters before that, and we had to work off the accruals. That number has been 7% for 10 years. We had a consultant that told us it was going to be higher last year, and that consultant is no longer working for us, but it's going to be 7% on an annual basis on average. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you again to everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions, please reach out to us using the contact information provided. Thank you, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Steven. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback's second quarter 2024 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam, and I appreciate everyone joining this morning. I hope you continue to find the Stockholders Letter that we issued last night, an efficient way to communicate. We spent a lot of time putting that letter together, and there's a lot of material contained in the text. Operator, would you please open the line for questions? Operator : Yes, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann with Truist. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, Travis and nice results. Travis, my first question is on sort of the leading capital efficiencies you all continue to highlight. Specifically, you talked about the latest announcement and I think you guys talked about dropping to 10 from 12 rigs and I think what that's even versus 14 a few months ago. And I'm just wondering, are the drilling efficiencies so good that you're able to maintain the pace from nearly 30% rigs than just a few months ago? And just wondering how you anticipate or if you anticipate the same type of efficiency as once you take over the Endeavor assets? Travis Stice : Sure. Good question, Neal. The first half of the year was really typified by us doing more with less. And you gave some numbers there, but just to, just to repeat some of those in January of this year, we estimated that we could get 24 wells per rig per year and now we're up to 26 wells per year for the rest of the year. And you see a similar efficiency gain on the completions, where we previously signaled 80 completions per year per crew, and now we're up to over 100 completions per crew per year. Those are simul-frac crews. And look, as we look into the future, one of the things that I get excited about is that these efficiencies are things that we don't get back. And so as we incorporate after close the new assets from Endeavor, I fully anticipate our operations organization combined with Endeavor's operations organization will be able to continue these results. And what's significant about that is when we talked to the market on February 12 announcing this deal, one of the biggest, the biggest synergy that we talked about was being able to apply Diamondback's current D&C cost on a larger asset. And I'm pleased to say today we're significantly below where we were in February. So that just accrues the benefit to our shareholders and, and really supercharges the delivery of the synergies that we were talking about. So, yes Neal, I'm very confident that we'll be able to continue this leading edge capital efficiency on a larger asset base. Neal Dingmann : Great to hear. Then I want to ask just quickly, on shareholder return plans, maybe just on sort of broad strokes, specifically, how would your plan vary? I mean, obviously, oil prices are jumping around. It could be anywhere from $90 to $70 environment. I'm just wondering, given your market sort of leading costs that we see on Slide 9, I'm just wondering, depending on where oil prices go, is that just a matter of having more free cash for buybacks and variable dividends or would there be any other changes we see in a high oil price environment versus a lower price environment? Travis Stice : Yes Neal, I mean I think the key point here is we've always had a very flexible return of capital program. Since the very beginning, when we put this in place in 2021, we've said we'd like to be able to flex between buying back shares and paying a variable dividends and we take that capital allocation decision very, very seriously. So we're set up in a way where if you have periods of weakness like we've seen over the last week or two, that's when the buyback kicks in. And if it continues to be weak, we'll continue to buy back more shares. That's the benefit of having a low break even on your capital program, low break even on your base dividend, and continuing to generate free cash flow down to much lower numbers than peers or than what the market is used to. So I think we're excited. If things do stay weak, we'll flex that buyback and be aggressive there. And if things improve and we have a good quarter in the 80s or 90s on crude then and we'll pay a big variable dividend. But I think that flexibility has been very, very advantageous to our shareholders over the last three years. Neal Dingmann : How low has that breakeven gotten down to? Travis Stice : Listen, we were very focused on looking at our base dividend breakeven at $40 crude, so mid-cycle capital costs $40 crude, we could keep production flat. I don't think in a $40 crude scenario we would do that. I think kind of lessons learned from what we've seen through the cycles over the years is that it's okay to let production decline if we were in a very, very weak commodity price scenario. But in that scenario, we should be allocating 100% of our free cash flow or even more to buying back shares, because in that situation, your share price is going to be likely to be very weak. So we're really trying to move the capital allocation decision from the field and the assets to what do you do with your free cash flow and that's I think is a good place to be. Neal Dingmann : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning and congrats again on very strong execution here. You've talked about getting that net debt level lower post transaction case. Kaes and Travis, how do you see yourself doing that? Is it through asset sales or through organic free cash flow generation? Just your perspective on the asset sale market recognizing you did some small deals here in the quarter? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neil. I mean, I think when we announced the deal, we were very conscious of the cash stock mix that we put in place for the Endeavor merger. I don't think we put it -- we didn't put so much cash in the deal that we had to be a seller of assets. But what you've seen us do is, sell multiple things now over the last couple quarters that start that up. Right? We sold a little bit of our Viper ownership to take some risk off the table and get some cash in the door. We sold our interest in WTG West Texas Gas to Energy Transfer. That will get some cash in the door. And then little things like our little mono [ph] sale that we did last quarter, all that kind of almost adds up to $1 billion, which on top of free cash flow generation between January 1 and today is going to reduce the cash outflow burden for the Endeavor deal. I think we planned on looking at the deal as a delevering process through free cash flow, but the asset sales are a kicker that accelerates that. And I think we're highly focused on getting to $10 billion as quickly as possible. And then I think things can slow down from there. But I don't think you'll see us be a forced seller of assets post deal close. And I think we're going to be very, very stingy on keeping operated properties in the Permian because they're kind of worth their weight in gold right now. Neil Mehta : Yes. Makes a ton of sense. And then just your perspective on managing gas price volatility, first of all, what are your latest thoughts on Matterhorn and when that comes in? And then secondly, how do you mitigate some of the risks around gas prices so you can really earn the margin that you deserve on the oil side of the equation? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, that's been a big topic lately and obviously we need to start making more money on our gas in the Permian and Diamondback specifically. If you look back to the history of Diamondback, we've grown through acquisition. A lot of the deals that we've done have come with marketing contracts where we don't control the molecule much further than the wellhead. And so what we've been doing over the last, I'll call it five years, is that as contracts roll off, we've been taking advantage of that and getting taken kind of rights on that molecule. We started with our commitment to Whistler and have grown that. That combined with Matterhorn will have a little bit of gas on both of those. And then I think you saw our press release last week that we're going to be a participant in the next pipeline from those guys, the Blackcomb Pipeline. And I just think that fits the strategy of let's take control of our molecules and see what we can do with them and I don't think that stops at pipeline commitments. We're really looking at power needs in the basin. Things like our Verde gas to gasoline plant and trying to find ways to create a local market here in the Permian, because it's a shame that we continue to sell gas near zero or below zero. So it's on us to continue to improve that portfolio and I think with size and scale and time we'll be able to do that. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Kaes. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Yes. My first question is just on the efficiency gains you highlighted in the letter. It looks like you're pushing you're drilling cycle times to 26 wells per rig and on the completion side, pushing 100 wells per frac fleet, simulfrac fleet. I was wondering, Kaes and Travis, if you could describe what the drivers of that those efficiency gains are and perhaps help us think about what's underwritten in the pro forma $1 billion to $4.4 billion guide for Endeavor for calendar 2025? Kaes Van' t Hof : Sure. On the rig side, we specifically talked about bit and bottom hole assembly improvements and again, that's not necessarily the adoption of some new emerging technology. I think it's really another example of what our guys do really, really good, which is a laser-like focus on every decision that's made. They measure almost every attribute of drilling the well and they seek for improvement and they compete against one well versus the other and we pay bonuses to the crews out there when they execute in a stellar fashion. So it's not something, again, that's easily repeatable and it's not a shelf item that someone can go take, but it's a culture of execution that's always been part of this business. On the completion side, there's been some design changes where we've increased rate, but we've also continued to try to optimize the exact way that we mobilize equipment. We've done some changes on some pipe down hole that allows a greater rate with less friction loss. So, again, it's nothing that's a marquee item, but it's just intense focus on doing what it is that we do, which is really, really execute well when we convert rock into cash flow. Danny Wesson : Yes, listen Arun, I mean all these things certainly have accrued to us since we announced the Endeavor merger in February. I think, as Travis mentioned earlier on the call, these are permanent items that aren't going to go away from service cost inflation or deflation. So as we work through the pro forma model, we're probably thinking that we're going to run closer to 18 to 20 rigs next year, versus 22 to 24 a while back, and closer to four to five simul-frac crews versus five plus. So we're certainly modeling these things accruing for the good guys, and it only give us a head start on the promises we made on 2025 numbers. Arun Jayaram : Great. My followup is just on the raised production guide. You raised your oil guide at the high end by close to 1.5%, just under that and then you took up CapEx. Kaes, one thing that wasn't quite intuitive is that you're completing 7% more feet on a net basis. And so one of the questions that's come in is, would have thought maybe the oil increase would have been a little bit higher based on that level of completed footage. But maybe you could help reconcile that for us this morning. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean, I don't think wells are completed like they look to be completed in the spreadsheet. Right? I mean, in 22 well pads, you move one pad from 2023 into 2024 and you got 22 extra wells. So we kind of moved almost, I think, 30 wells from 2023 into 2024. So our well count is a little bit higher than maybe a true level loaded run rate would be. But I think we're also just preparing room for a major acquisition to close. And I think we're doing everything we can on our side to be prepared to hit the ground running and hit numbers right away and do exactly what you would expect us to do. So I think more importantly, it's the more drilled lateral footage for less CapEx that gives us a lot of flexibility in the second half of the year and carry that momentum into 2025. Arun Jayaram : Makes total sense. Thanks, Kaes and Travis. Kaes Van' t Hof : You bet. Thanks, Arun. Travis Stice : Thanks, Arun. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. Your line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Hey, Travis, Kaes, Danny and team, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to followup on some of the earlier questions. You've obviously seen a lot of field efficiencies, particularly on the drilling side. You've lowered the Midland footage costs down, I guess 20 some dollars to midpoint. But I'm curious, like as you approach this 3Q to potentially 3Q or 4Q Endeavor closing, are there any parts of the efficiencies that you're seeing that you don't think that you could accomplish with as a synergy here? Because it would seem like that $300 million or so of synergies that you apportioned to just CapEx savings is increasing by the day. Danny Wesson : Well, that's why I highlighted, David, that where we are today is much better in performance and execution than where we were just in February when we talked to you about this deal. These are cultural elements, this attention to detail, this focus, this laser-like attention to execution. And we look forward to bringing on our new friends from Endeavor. And look, David, from what we hear from them anecdotally, they're seeing similar efficiency gains as well, too. So when we put the two cultures together, I expect it to be an add or not a detractor when we actually put the two companies together here before too much longer. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that and then just a followup to that. You've also seen the benefits of longer lateral progression, I guess, relative to your original plan this year. I know one of the things you highlighted with the Endeavor deal was the potential increase of lateral lengths to 15,000 further [ph] and beyond given 100,000 plus number of acres, how do you see the progression, I guess, into next year and then 26 in terms of lateral lengths relative to where we're at today or is this something that's a longer term endeavor? Travis Stice : Well, first we're going to have to get the two assets put together, which we obviously can't do that currently. I'll let Kaes answer the synergy question specifically, but I wanted to highlight something that we talked about in our earnings release and our stockholder letter was that we drilled a 20,000 foot lateral well in under eight days, under nine days, seven, eight days. And longer is not going to be a problem. It's just we need to make sure we have the least geometry to be able to drill even longer wells. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean, I think, David, on the plan we can't put anything together until post close, but I think the priority for the teams right now is what does the plan look like end of 2024 and into 2025 post close and then what are the projects look like starting to back out to 2025 and into 2026, start to extend laterals. I mean, I think holding the level that we have this year, almost 12,000 feet on average for 300 wells is a pretty stellar number that we should probably look to maintain. I think going much further than that for a full program of 500 plus wells a year is going to be tough to do. But I don't think the guys are scared of drilling to 20,000 feet and if we have those opportunities, we'll take advantage of them. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate the color, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. First topic I just wanted to followup on is on the return of capital framework. When you look at Slide 6 and just sort of think about, again the efficiency gains that are really impressive, and is over time as that sort of drives that maintenance CapEx or reinvestment rate lower, should we think of maybe the first kind of evolution of that return of capital framework just being that creates like a bigger, I guess for lack of a better word, wedge that can go to that base dividend? Is that more likely kind of the way it would evolve as opposed to maybe increasing that 50% plus that's going to shareholders overall? Travis Stice : Yes John, I mean, I think those are two separate decisions, but I think you hit the nail on the head on as efficiencies accrue and our decline rate shallows over time and your balance sheet shrinks over time, that should create room there between your breakeven and your $40 dividend breakeven. So I think that's how we're still going to look at it. I think we see dollar $40 on the E&P side as a very well protected number. We're still going to buy puts at right now we're buying them at $55, $60 crude, but eventually probably reduce the value of our put buying down to closer to $50 just to protect the extreme downside scenario. And I think the rest of the free cash, we did move back from 75% of free cash going to equity down to $50. But that doesn't mean that number is not going to be higher in the future in times of stress. I think in times of stress or significant stress, the number should be a lot higher than 50% of free cash going to equity. And when things are going well, the numbers should be closer to 50, and we'll continue to build a fortress balance sheet. I've been very pleased with the response from our large shareholders on cutting back to 50% of free cash going to equity, because they want us to have a more fortress balance sheet than we even thought going into the deal. So I think that's been a pleasant relief and allows us to build a lot more cash and be ready for the inevitable down cycle in this sector. Kaes Van' t Hof : And John, I think a good way to demonstrate or a good way to visualize the Board's commitment to this sustainable and growing dividend is on Slide 7. Go all the way back to 2018, when we initiated the dividend and you can see on that slide the growth rate. And on the bottom half of that slide, you can see that our commitment has translated into almost $8 billion of capital returned to our shareholders. So it is a meaningful lever that we have as a company and the Board's commitment to continue the sustainable and growing dividend. John Freeman : That's great. And then just my followup when we take these efficiency gains that have allowed you all to basically pump the brakes on rigs and frac crews in the second half of the year without missing a beat on the original production plan, is there any environment where you all would choose to basically just sort of plow ahead at the run rate you all were on in the first half of the year and just sort of allow production growth to accelerate? Is there any sort of an environment where you would foresee that ever kind of occurring? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, just where we sit right now, John, that's not a logical scenario that we see playing out in the next six months, three, four quarters. Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, historically we've tried post-COVID favor free cash flow generation over growth, and I think you've seen that trend continue here with what we're doing in 2024. John Freeman : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Scott Hanold : Yes, thank you. There's been a lot of talk of good operational efficiencies. Could you maybe pivot in and talk about what you're seeing in terms of, well performance of productivity over the last year. Is it pretty much status quo on apples to apples basis or are you seeing some gains there as well? Travis Stice : Mill. We're: So I think we've had a few really, really good years of well performance. We're always trying to keep pushing the performance side, but I think this year has been a year of cost gains versus well performance gains, but that doesn't mean there's not significant inventory expansion going on across our portfolio. Energen: So I think we've had a few really, really good years of well performance. We're always trying to keep pushing the performance side, but I think this year has been a year of cost gains versus well performance gains, but that doesn't mean there's not significant inventory expansion going on across our portfolio. Scott Hanold : Thanks for that. And then my follow up question is, you kind of highlighted obviously all the drilling efficiencies again and I think you made a comment that from what you understand, the Endeavor folks are seeing some similar stuff. But can you give us some context like based on what you can see from your understanding at this point? Where is Endeavor relative to where Diamondback is? So just trying to get a sense of should we expect once the merged company comes together, there's still some work to do to get it back, to get it all toward where Diamondback is right now, or is it going to be pretty much just hitting the ground running? Travis Stice : Well, it's going to be hard work for sure. It's our job to do that hard work and make it look easy for you guys. There's some decisions that we'll make pretty soon after we combine the two companies. One would be the use of clear drilling fluids and the second would be to put more of the frac operations onto simul-frac. So those are the two biggest levers that have the quickest change. But look, we're also going to, like we've always done, check our egos at the door and make sure we seek to understand what the Endeavor team is already doing. And historically that's generated better results when we seek first to understand and then pick the best path forward with the combined inputs from legacy Diamondback, and the new asset, new management from Endeavor. So we're going to make it look easy, but there's going to be, it's hard work behind the scenes, but I'm really confident that both of the two leadership teams are going to be able to pull this off and make it look good. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean, I think from a numbers perspective, the way we're thinking about it is the pro forma business will be running basically kind of 21, 22 rigs off the start, and then by 2025, we'll probably be averaging closer to 18 to 19 combined. Scott Hanold : It's good color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Good morning. Following up on those intriguing operational efficiencies, you mentioned the average of 26 wells per rig year, 100 wells per crew. What's the pace setting, rig or crew look like? Is it significantly ahead of that or is there a big opportunity to grab? Danny Wesson : Hey Bob, it's Danny. Yes, I mean I think the crews and the rigs are pretty well all within a margin of error of each other in their performance. We've been really pretty active on fleet management over the past few years and continue to optimize our fleet where we see dwindling performance. And the best thing about our operation is the collaboration we have between the teams on sharing best practices on best-in-class rigs. So when we look at the rigs across the board there's always one pace setting rig, but that tends to move around as we share best practices and the other rigs catch up and then another one will pass that rig. So not one unique standout that's driving that number. It's pretty well across the board at that same level of efficiency. Travis Stice : We do have a pretty healthy competition between internally and then we also every quarter we look externally and there's a pretty healthy competition. And that's why in our Stockholders Letter, I talked about in this quarter in the Midland Basin the drilling team got over 20,000 feet with a single bit run and that represents a record in the Midland Basin. So I'm sure that record will fall, but it's just part of the culture of evaluate internally and externally and compete to win and that's what our organization does. Bob Brackett : Yes, very clear. Quick follow up along that line. How do we think about the relative price between pulling on that ROP lever versus reducing nonproductive time or even reducing mob/de-mob time? Are they equal sized prices or is one the more obvious of the three? Travis Stice : I think it kind of moves but you're getting to the point in time where, there's the little things we're focusing on now or the efficiency drivers. We talked in the last call about the guys focusing on pipe makeup speeds because that was where they saw the most NPT [ph] time on a well was just how long it takes them to break and make a pipe. And we're constantly looking at where that dead space is in these jobs and trying to attack it. And we don't just attack one dead space, we attack them all at the same time. And I think, you know, NPT [ph] time has been a focus of coming out of the really aggressive activity levels we saw in 2023. And we've really done a good job of reducing NPT time, but there are certainly always things we can focus on there to continue to drive uptime and drive constant performance and not waiting on the sidelines for something to be fixed. Kaes Van' t Hof : And when we look at those details, we do it every quarter for sure. And what Danny is talking about requires a great deal of collaboration across all the teams. And even though I emphasize the competition aspect of what it is that we do, the collaborative aspect is really where this sits home, because when one team finds a solution, it's quickly shared with all the other teams internally. And in a similar fashion, if we find something externally, we would quickly adopt that as well, too. Bob Brackett : Very clear, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you, good morning. Travis Stice : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Congrats on another solid quarter, guys. Just a couple of questions kind of operating focused here. One, if we look at the production beat here in the second quarter, you got it on NGL and gas. We were just sort of curious. We kind of figured maybe you stripped more liquids out of the gas, but then you would have lower gas production. So maybe a little bit of insights into kind of what's lifting the NGL side and keeping the gas production up? Travis Stice : Yes, I think on the NGL side, trying to put as much ethane as you can in the NGLs to get them out of the basin, we even probably throughout the second quarter, we saw obviously a lot of gas price weakness. So we did take a couple of our highest GOR wells down for a month or two to ease that pressure. So I think even in the face of that, the gas curve continues to outperform expectations. But we kind of even curtailed a little bit of oil to make sure our gas production was a little bit lower in the quarter, which we kind of have continued in the third. So we just have a lot of gas production out of this basin, and that's kind of why we have such a focus now on trying to generate more value for the gas that we're producing, whether that be in basin or out of basin. Danny Wesson : Yes. And just to add to that, the focus on around environmental performance has driven a lot of decisions to not burn gas in the field for energy consumption and instead convert that energy demand to electrical demand. And so you're seeing a lot of gas that would have otherwise been burnt in the field to run our operation being put down the pipeline. And then on top of that, the focus on reducing, flaring those are all things that send gas to sales and get reported as a production number. That's driving some of that increase you're seeing across the basin. Roger Read : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just coming back to the drilling efficiencies and the completion efficiencies going from 24 to 26 wells on our completions, can you give us an idea of maybe where the upper 10% or upper quartile is? In other words, I'm trying to think of if 24 went to 26 is the best 30, and that's where you can ultimately go or it's a much tighter dispersion so it's 26 the average best 28, maybe worse, is 24. I'm just trying to get a feel for the further improvements kind of the same idea on the completion side. Danny Wesson : I think, it's a good question. It just depends. But we certainly have some rigs that are drilling at a pace of 30 plus wells a year. Just depends on which zones and lateral links and all that kind of stuff. But we're really focusing on pad cycle times and how to reduce the full pad cycle time. These are large pads and give driving flexibility in the plan by reducing that cycle time on the pads is really what's important to us. And so if we have one rig that's outperforming the others in one zone, we want to look at that zone, what that rig is doing and kind of share it with the other rigs so that we can accrue that benefit to all the pad development across our portfolio. Roger Read : Got you. And maybe if I could just clarify on that. Three mile laterals versus something less than that as a percentage of total. Danny Wesson : I'm sorry, just to rephrase your question, are you asking what's their percentage of three mile laterals to? Roger Read : Yes, you said, it depends on what you're drilling and which zones. I was just curious, is there, obviously, it would take not as long to drill a lesser length lateral, but I was just \u2013 is there a percentage that you offer of the much longer lateral wells? Danny Wesson : I think our 15,000 footers this year were like at 25%-ish of our development. Travis Stice : Yes, listen, the rig per year number is an output of getting 300 wells per year drilled. Right? It's really about net lateral footage or gross lateral footage drilled per year per rig. I think Danny is talking about 30 wells per rig. Well, I think if we're drilling more Wolfcamp D with a particular rig, that rig is going to be a little slower. But I think the general standard Wolfberry development is pushing that upper, upper echelon, but we really see the rig count as the output of what we need to do from a drilling perspective on hitting production guidance. Roger Read : All right, thanks for indulging me the extra question, guys. Travis Stice : No problem. Danny Wesson : Thanks, Roger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Jay of Daniel Energy Partners. Your line is now open. Geoff Jay : Hey, guys, just one quick one from me. I'm just kind of curious how you think about the potential for trimul-frac in your portfolio, kind of especially after Endeavor closes. Travis Stice : Yes, I mean, we've looked a lot at trimul-frac, and the struggle for us is the infrastructure spend we'd have to implement to get to trimul-frac across our portfolio. And does that additional infrastructure spend, do we recognize the return on that from the efficiency gains from moving from simul-frac to trimul-frac? We think the cost benefit somewhere in the move from simul-frac to trimul-frac, certainly something we would pursue in areas where we have the infrastructure in place to do so. And if we have available enough development in that area, in those areas to dedicate a trimul-frac crew, you would see us move that direction very quickly. Geoff Jay : Excellent, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning. Travis, Kaes and the rest of the Diamondback team there. Travis Stice : Hi, Charles. Charles Meade : Travis, yes thank you. I want to -- I think you really tantalized a lot of people with that metric. I really appreciated it, that 24 wells a year, 26 wells a year. But I thought Kaes' comment was really, really interesting in that I've been focused on that. I think other callers have been, but really, that's the output rather than the. It's kind of a manifestation or an indicator rather than a driver, if I understand case correctly and so if that's the right way of looking at it. When I look at the other pieces of your guidance, you've actually increased the lateral length a little bit, and you've increased the well count a little bit. And so is the delta on the drilling side actually a little bit bigger the delta, the improvement you've seen since your initial plan than that 24 over or 26 over 24 would indicate? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean, I think so, Charles. I think the point I was trying to make is that as a public company that has public guidance and quarterly guidance, we really work from guidance backwards, and we make what looks like an easy output on the surface is very difficult below the surface. There's a lot going on in terms of the teams being able to move things around and add rigs here and drop rigs there and the plan isn't always the plan. We got to be nimble and work together as a group. And I think that harmony we have across all of our functions is what makes us pretty unique, particularly also given that we're in one basin. So I would say the drilling improvements this year have been more surprising than the completion improvements because we always kind of thought that drilling was already near the asymptotic curve of what they've been able to do. Not to knock the frac guys, but the drilling improvements probably supersede the frac improvements here today. Charles Meade : Thank you for those comments. Kaes, go ahead. That's all from me. Kaes Van' t Hof : That's a little test for the FRAC guys to step it up next quarter. Charles Meade : Yes. Glad to put the ball in the tee for you there. Have a great day. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Charles. Travis Stice : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning, Paul. Kaes Van' t Hof : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Travis and Kaes, that we appreciate that about great improvement in your result. But just curious that, I mean, over the next two or three years, if we're looking at the productivity improvement in drilling and completion, is that one or two areas you see as the biggest potential for you and will you be able to also quantify on that? And the second question is that if we look at oil pro forma over the next couple of years, I mean, in order to maintain a flat production post-Endeavor, I mean, how many wells that we need, is it 500, 520, 550 any kind of rough idea? And also that do you have what Endeavor gas pricing right now, are they all in the Waha basin or that they're also spread? Thank you. Travis Stice : Well, I'll talk specifically about your look ahead for two to three years and I think if you put it in one bucket, it would be in the down-hole sensing technology that allows the bit to stay in the best rock, the highest percentage of time. And then on the completion side, understanding using downhill sensing, where you can place the most frac energy in the most efficient way that creates the greatest stimulated rock volume. And these sensing technologies are evolving very, very rapidly. I think before too long we'll be able to actually sense in front of the drill bit and drill towards a target rather than drilling past it and making adjustments. And that sounds like a small change, but I think the sensing technology that we're right on the cusp of having some of those problems solved is going to be a real game changer for our industry. Kaes Van' t Hof : Paul, on your well count question, I think kind of low 500 is a good place to start and as low 500 dwells per year, but as you know, the land efficiencies accrue to us and laterals extend and the decline rate shallows a bit, you probably start to get below that 500 number should production stay flat. Now, if things are a market that's conducive to growth, that probably changes, but on a flat basis, it's more capital efficiency, less CapEx, less wells to hit the same numbers longer term. Paul Cheng : Great. And Kaes, do you have an idea that what Endeavor gas exposure to Waha? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. So listen, we've seen what exposure Endeavor has. I do think there's going to be a lot of opportunities for both of us combined to get gas outside of the basin. We got to close the deal first and then we can start making decisions. But I think both companies are aligned that more gas needs to get out of the basin and less exposure to Waha. Paul Cheng : Okay, thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : I wanted to followup on some of the comments you made around the share buyback. Obviously you guys had leaned more on the variable dividend in the past quarter, but you certainly kind of indicated from some of your comments here on the call that given the recent pullback in the stock and the sector, the buyback was looking more palatable. I'm just trying to get a sense if you guys are able to start executing on the buyback here post quarter. Are there some restrictions in place with respect to the Endeavor deal that would prevent some of that over the next couple of months until the deal closes? Travis Stice : Yes, Leo, I don't think there's any more Endeavor specific restrictions. Obviously, we're now reporting earnings today, so we're in a blackout day. But I think these periods of weakness allow us to step in and we pre wire the buyback for every blackout period. And I think if we continue to see weakness here, we'll get opportunities. We just have a little more flexibility if the windows open versus closed. Leo Mariani : Okay, I appreciate that. And then just in your comments here and your guidance for the rest of the year, it looks like third quarter CapEx is coming down some versus 2Q. It certainly sounds like activity is falling a little bit in the second half of the year and some of the OFS cost reductions are kind of rolling through as well. I mean, do you see standalone without Endeavor, CapEx continuing to kind of drop a little bit and activity kind of dropping a little bit in 4Q as well. I'm just trying to get a sense that that's kind of the low point for spend and activity on a standalone basis here. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I think it'll be the low point for spend because we're a cash CapEx reporter. I think the low point for activity will be this quarter. So I think we'll probably bring back our fourth simul-frac crew end of this quarter into the beginning of next quarter. That's all on a standalone basis and probably bring back a rig or two, but not much more than that, so I would say Q3 is the low for activity, Q4 is the low for CapEx. Leo Mariani : Okay, thanks. Operator : All right, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kalei Akamine of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kalei Akamine : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of focus on field efficiency, so I'll leave that alone. I want to ask you guys about Deep Blue. The team over there continues to be very acquisitive. It looks like that business has grown about maybe 20% plus or minus over the past year in terms of capacity. Can you talk a little bit about the growth outlook for that business potential Endeavor, drop down included, and maybe help us understand what the scale of the business could be once it matures? Travis Stice : Yes. Listen, I think we're very pleased with what the Deep Blue team has done in a short period of time. It's kind of exactly why we did the deal with them. Right? They've got a lot of third party wins, wins that Diamondback wouldn't get if Diamondback was trying to gather someone else's water. And on top of that, a little bit of M&A to boost capacity and reduce costs there. So we're really excited with what they're doing. Endeavor has a very impressive water system that could be a candidate to merge with Deep Blue, but I think that the price has got to be right for Diamondback shareholders, and that's what we're focused on first. But, yes, listen, they're doing a really good job building a sizable business on the water side. And with the amount of water that it takes to run multiple simul-frac crews at the same time, you're moving hundreds of thousands of barrels of water a day at low cost. So very, very impressed with what they're doing. I don't think they're ready to monetize yet. It's a longer term investment for us and we look forward to continuing to support that business. Kalei Akamine : Okay. From numbers, given the size of Endeavor, does it potentially double the size of that business? Travis Stice : It's probably a little less than double, probably about two-thirds the size of the business today. But it adds a lot of capacity and really moves into that Western Martin or Eastern Martin County area and connects the system nicely. Kalei Akamine : Thanks for that. And then maybe following up on your comments on Wolf D and the Upper Sprayberry, can you talk a little bit about that program for this year? Talk about how you're layering those zones into your development plans, whether they're co-developed with other zones, for example, and if there's any learning to take away from this 2024 program. Travis Stice : Yes, I think so, we added the Upper Sprayberry as a test. Well, kind of in the North Martin area, like Kaes mentioned a couple of years ago, really pleased with the performance of that well. This year we've tested it in a co-developed fashion and like Kaes said, we're not seeing any real degradation there. And so what we plan to do going forward is to add that to the development zones for the North Martin area. Kaes Van' t Hof : I think we have some tests that are co-developed and some tests that are standalone. There are certain areas where the Wolfcamp D is significantly deeper than the Wolfcamp B, and we're not seeing communication. And there are some areas where it probably just makes sense to develop it with the stack because of above ground efficiencies. Travis Stice : Yes, I think that's right. We tested the Wolfcamp D kind of in that same North Martin area and really not seeing any communication with Wolfcamp B. So we think it's a zone that we can come back and get or where it competes for capital we'll add it to the stack. Kalei Akamine : That's awesome. I appreciate that, guys. Travis Stice : Thank you. Operator : All right, thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thank you again for everyone participating in today's call. If you've got any questions please reach out to us using the contact information we\u2019ve previously provided. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Adam Lawlis, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Adam Lawlis : Thank you, Julia. Good morning, and welcome to Diamondback's third quarter 2024 conference call. During our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation and Letter to Stockholders, which can be found on Diamondback's website. Representing Diamondback today are Travis Stice, Chairman and CEO; Kaes Van't Hof, President and CFO; and Danny Wesson, COO. During this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. We caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. Information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the SEC. In addition, we will make reference to certain non-GAAP measures. The reconciliations with the appropriate GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon. I'll now turn the call over to Travis Stice. Travis Stice : Thank you, Adam. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning. I hope you've had a chance to review both the shareholder letter that went out last night as well as the investor day. We'll be covering a lot of that material in today's question session. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neal Dingmann of Truist. Your line is now open. Neal Dingmann : Morning guys. Nice update last night, Travis. Guys, I'll save all my AI and data center questions this morning for your year-end call and I'll jump into my first question this morning on capital efficiency which again, I think by my calculation you all continue to have better than any other E&P. And so specifically, could you all for your Travis, maybe speak to what you all believe could be your realistic free cash flow per barrel next year or actually looking at, just looking at what your breakeven would be assuming cost operations and well results continue to trend as they've been year-to-date. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Neal, we've really focused on free cash flow generation over, CapEx spend in recent years and I expect that trend to continue. I think, with the Endeavor assets under the under the hood, that only improves our free cash flow margin, our reinvestment rate goes lower. Our corporate breakeven, we highlighted went down by two or three dollars a barrel. And I think in a world of a tenuous macro, the lowest break even and the longest duration of inventory is going to pay dividends. There's two things we really look at free cash flow margin, which is the output of the reinvestment rate but also how much CapEx are we spending per barrel of oil produced? And we like to say that we have the highest amount of barrels produced per dollar of CapEx in the business and you expect that trend to continue. So a lot of times a lot of work has been done here integrating two companies very, very quickly. I'm ecstatic about the progress that's been made. We've already learned some things from the Endeavor side and vice versa. And I think that's all going to accrue to the benefit of our shareholders through more free cash flow over a longer period of time. Neal Dingmann : Are you willing to put a number on where you see breakeven going at some point next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean I think we laid it out on slide 9. The post dividend breakeven has gone from $40 a barrel to $37 a barrel by our map. I think we've always tried to say that we'd like our base dividend to break even at $40 a barrel. So either our breakeven has gone down or we have more implied capacity to look at the base dividend, which we expect to do early in 2025 outstanding. Neal Dingmann : Then my second question on the TRP asset trade, specifically how you all thought about valuation on each side. I'm just wondering on the Delaware PDP side, was that based largely just on reserve value of the assets and then looking at the Midland side. Is that based on a per location or maybe tell me what else I'm missing when you're all thinking about that swap. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. So I'll give you the high level. The operated acreage in the Permian is very, very valuable. And since we did the Endeavour deal, we've been pretty vocal that we're not a seller of the Delaware Basin. I think this trade was pretty unique in that TRP gets to move into the Delaware Basin and test some things in secondary zones. But Diamondback gets 18 DUCs in the Midland Basin, a little more current production, and 55 locations that compete for capital right away. So we're basically moving third and fourth quartile inventory into first and second quartile inventory, all while getting the benefit of capital efficiency from 18 DUCs added to the program and assets in our backyard. So we're looking at other options for other assets like this TRP trade. TRP was the first to move here and we were excited to get a trade done with them because those are pretty hard to do. Neal Dingmann : No. Great. Nice deal. Kaes Van' t Hof : From a valuation perspective, I'd say the high level PDP values were pretty similar. I would say we have a lower decline rate that we're selling. We're getting more current production at a higher decline rate, but we're also paying for DUCs, and these 55 top quartile locations, which are worth a lot these days in the Midland Basin. Neal Dingmann : Great details. Thanks, Kaes. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Neal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Securities LLC. The line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning, team. Travis, you have -- from a Diamondback perspective, it feels like the company has your hands in terms of several cookie jars. In terms of your equity investments, I was wondering if you could help us frame kind of the value creation potential or embedded maybe asset value that we may not be giving you credit for as we think about investments in the epic crude line Deep Blue, and obviously maybe I don't know if I like Neal, I can wait until you're in. I wanted to get your thoughts on this data center kind of opportunity with the surface acres because investors have noted how one of a company who's developing a data center, Reeves county, has a pretty punchy evaluation in the equity market. Travis Stice : Sure, lots of questions there, Arun, but thanks for your time this morning. Listen on, on this whole data center deal, we've been listening to our shareholders to try to figure out a way to respond to their questions about can we create more value from our gas stream. And when you look at what we have as a total company, we've got abundant natural gas, we've got abundant surface acreage, over 65,000 acres on a pro forma basis, and there's a need for greater electricity. So rather than continuing to, get low margins on our gas and full boat on electricity, we're trying to figure out a way to be creative. Creative on ways to turn some of that natural gas into more value for our shareholders. The EPIC pipeline was a move that allowed us to increase our ownership almost to a full third, trying to recognize that there's ultimately going to be a need out of the Permian Basin for increased crude capacity. And so, while it's probably not a long-term investment, we think like a lot of our other equity investment methods, we'll be able to turn that into a very nice, very nice return for our shareholders. And in Deep Blue, we just continued to evaluate, the sustainability of the efficiency of that business model and recognize that there's some Endeavor assets that could potentially fit into that as well as we continue to unpack value creation from the pro forma companies. Arun Jayaram : Great. My follow up is I just wanted to maybe understand on the efficiency gain side of the equation, in your prepared remarks, you commented how you think you can kind of execute your 2025 program with 18 rigs versus maybe a previous expectation of 22 to 24, maybe four frac fleets versus five previously. Understanding you're probably seeing the same amount of footage, what type of dollar per foot or cost gains you get from just running less horsepower and rig and rig lines. Just trying to understand that dynamic. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I mean, we set out when we announced the Endeavor deal thinking that 2025 would need between 22 and 24 rigs. There's been a lot of efficiency on both sides throughout the year. And that 18 rig number is still going to accomplish the same amount of lateral footage as the higher rig count. I think from a rig perspective, it's all about controlling variable costs, right? We also put pipe in the ground. We also use the raw materials, the same raw materials throughout the basin. But Diamondback is able to do that a lot faster. And so, if a rig line is $70,000, $80,000 a day being able to execute with six less rigs, translates to less variable costs in the business. Similar story on the frac side. We think on the frac side, we kind of learned from the Endeavor side about the higher pump rate. We kind of increased our pump rate from 80 barrels a minute up to kind of 90 to 100. That allows us to one complete wells faster. There could be some benefits to the reservoir that we're studying very, very closely. But overall, that also reduces the variable costs needed to run frac crews, which are much more expensive than a rig on a day to day basis. So, I think there will be periods of time where we need to run five simul-frac crews next year. High level, we can see, we see the simul-frac crews completing a little over 100 wells per year per crew. And it's just amazing the efficiencies that both sides of the ledger have squeezed out of the business here in a year where, we keep saying, oh, they're close to the asymptotic curve of efficiency. Well, they blew that out of the water this year. So kudos to the teams and the basin experts executing on our business. Travis Stice : Arun, just to add to that. I think from a high level perspective, the message that we really tried to emphasize was that all of the things that Kaes just outlined really describe delivery of synergies not only ahead of time, which we had originally contemplated through the year of 2025, we effectively got all of the synergies delivered now in the fourth quarter of 2024. So it's faster and it's lower. We put a note in there that we're on middle of basin wells. We're now at $600 a foot, and I think these guys got some momentum behind them that we're going to continue to see an improvement in that number. So high level, really proud of the organizations that they've checked their egos and looked at the right way to do things from both perspectives. And what we're seeing early on is some significant synergy deliveries. And I just want to, I know you've already seen these, but I want you to just mention it that we've put our, like we've done in the past, we've put our Synergy scorecard in our investor deck with some details behind it. So if you'll just look at slides 6 and 7, you'll see a lot of the details that Kaes was just highlighting and then also some of the high level comments that I made. Arun Jayaram : Thanks, Travis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum of TD Cowen. The line is now open. David Deckelbaum : Thanks guys. Travis, in case I just wanted to ask, just in the context of some of the Synergy scorecard being achieved perhaps a little bit earlier than anticipated and obviously announcing some of the incremental savings, you guys are sort of still kind of standing by that 4.1 to 4.4 budget for next year to kind of keep this 475,000 barrels a day flat. Are we at the point now, I guess what sort of activity does that envision? And just given some of the incremental cost savings that we're seeing, are we trending now to be all the way at the lower end or is there kind of a cushion built in there for some flexibility going into 2026? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, good question, David. We always like a little flexibility. I think given the macro environment, as Travis said in his letter, there's some things we're thinking about for next year. Again, always thinking about free cash flow, generation, overspending, CapEx dollars, but I think we're certainly near the lower end of that original range, 4.1 to 4.4 to get to 480,000 barrels of oil a day next year. That includes the 5,000 barrels a day that Viper guided to in our Tumbleweed acquisition. I think generally if you see, well costs down $25 a lateral foot, we're completing about 5 million lateral feet a year. That's $125 million. So that's certainly going to be taken out of the budget. I do think there's still some of the ancillary spend items that we're refining, combined infrastructure budget, midstream budget, environmental budget, but in general, certainly moving towards the lower end of that range, we guided Q4 to 950 million to 10.50 million of CapEx. I wouldn't want to multiply the lower end of that number by four to get to your 2025 budget. But I'd certainly look at the midpoint or the high end to guide you to next year because I think, a lot of things are heading the right direction. Not only well cost, but well performance. Things like the TRP trade, all that's going to accrue to the benefit of the CapEx budget next year. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate all that color. It makes sense. Perhaps you can get just add a little bit of color just on some of the. I know some others talked about some of the other assets midstream you guys have highlighted obviously the royalty drop down. It seems like in the deck there's some expectation that some monetization is coming in 2025. Can you kind of give a little bit of color on where those processes stand now and when you'd be expecting to see some inflows from there? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. So, the big item is the drop down of mineral interest to Viper. That's actively ongoing. We've been pretty vocal that early 2025 is our goal there. I don't see anything that's taking us off that track. Second is the midstream discussion with our partners at Deep Blue. I think that's a little less important than the Viper drop down at the moment. And then, it's been interesting closing this deal. Mr. Stevens was notorious for having a lot, owning a lot of assets throughout the, throughout the country. We got some small assets in the Bakken, we got a small piece of some offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. So, we're excited to continue to monetize some of those. Some of the smaller assets. I don't think they're going to make a huge dent in the cash number, but they're all little things that you'd expect us to monetize at the right time. I think the other big item is about 15,000 acres in the Delaware basin of both operated and non-operated positions. So we're going to look at that, try to trade and block up where we can. But we're not in the non-op business given our cost structure and we'd likely monetize that into a very healthy market at some point. David Deckelbaum : Thank you guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : Good morning. Your 2025 base plan is clear and you mentioned the ability to refine that plan based on the macro environment. Can you talk about how viable that plan is before dis efficiency kick in? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Bob, I think we got a lot of flexibility. I don't think it's the tool, it's the [Indiscernible]. Right. So we can dial things up and back very, very, very easily. I think just generally, if other companies are seeing what we're seeing, this is not a strong macro environment. So I don't know why the discussion of growth or multiyear growth needs to be in the equation. I think Diamondback has learned that our growth profile impacts the macro. And we're very focused on the macro here where almost universally the street is calling for oversupply in 2025. So I think we're building in flexibility to spend less should that come to fruition. But it's not hard to grow volumes in the Permian basin with the assets that we have. So I think what you would expect is, what looks easy on the outside is hard on the inside, but we make it happen. Bob Brackett : But can it be gradual? Can it be like deferring some wells or does it have to be dropping a rig line or dropping a frac spread? What's the. Can you tweak things around the edge, I guess? Kaes Van' t Hof : Oh yes. I mean, we already do that, Bob. We went into the year running 15 rigs. Endeavour was running 10. Our team was -- 12. Our team was ahead of schedule. We dropped to 10 rigs mid-year because we had drilled more wells than we expected in the first six months of the year. So, dropping rigs, adding rigs, dropping a crew, swapping a crew, that's just what you expect us to do. Danny Wesson : And Bob, this is Danny. Our supply chain setups such that we don't really have any, really firm obligations with any kind of significant terms. So we've got flexibility built into our supply chain so that we can pivot to any market conditions or signals that we need to. And it won't be on a week by week basis. But if we see certainly a longer term trend in the market, we'll pivot our activity levels to protect our free cash flow and focus on driving shareholder returns over any kind of growth or production output. Bob Brackett : Very clear. Thanks. Danny Wesson : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Neil Mehta : Yes. Good morning, team. I just love your perspective on the macro. I think, Travis, in your letter and in these comments, you've kind of shared a more cautious view for 2025. Is that a demand driven via supply driven view? And then, you've taken a different tack than some of the majors and other independents. It takes a little bit more of a growth orientation into 2025 in the Permian. Why do you think your strategy is the right strategy? Travis Stice : Well, as Kaes outlined, our strategy really is for flexibility. And when you look at the macro right now, it's kind of hard to look at a world that has 4 million to 6 million barrels a day of surplus capacity on the sidelines and try to think we can grow effectively into that. We've learned as an industry and at Diamondback the hard way that, you really need to focus on shareholder returns and free cash flow generation in this industry. And there may be a call for growth at some point in the future and I expect our shareholders would look to us to respond to that call. But it's certainly nothing that we hear or see today. And as Danny alluded to, we've got the flexibility to go any direction we need to go. But with this macro, macro view, we're going to just stay conservative and let volume be the output of cash flow generation. Kaes Van' t Hof : Well, and most importantly, we're focused on per share cash flow and free cash flow. Right. So if the macro is tenuous in 2025, well, per share metrics are going to have to grow through a lower share count. And we've always been about per share metrics, both cash flow and free cash flow. We have a slide in our deck that shows that growth over time. So that's not going to stop. I just think being cognizant of your impact to the global market is important and it's a lesson that Diamondback learned through 2020 and we hope the industry also learns that lesson. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thanks, Kaes. And thanks Travis. That's the follow up which is just around share buybacks. At different points in the cycle, you've elected towards the variable or dividend oriented strategy versus the buyback. But it's notable that you're really leaning back into the share repurchase program. So can you get to talk about that evolution? Maybe it's the reflection of your thoughts on valuation and maybe being countercyclical if you do think we're in a softer period in 2025, but just your thoughts on the best way to allocate capital and why you're leaning towards the buyback. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I think Travis would echo this comment, but capital allocation is our most important job and we've had a flexible capital allocation philosophy since we started this lower growth, high free cash flow generation business. We've always been able to flex between a buyback and a variable dividend. I would say post Endeavor, we certainly have a business that's worth more combined and diamondback standalone per share. And so that's increased kind of our tolerance for buying back shares at these levels. I mean, I think, should things get improved from here, we buy back less. Should things get significantly worse from here, we lean in and use more of our free cash flow to buy back shares. That's what you'd expect us to do. I think the only thing that's really, going to be steady is base dividend and base dividend growth. But you should expect us to maintain that flexibility between buyback and variable despite our larger size. Travis Stice : And I think, Neil, the countercyclicality of share repurchases has proven to be the right strategy in a commodity based business. Our industry over the last 10 years probably has many instances where oil price was high, free cash flow was high, and share repurchases were high. And then oil price cycles down and you end up either issuing shares at the bottom or other unanticipated results. So again, just like we were talking about on the flexibility of our return program, we try to learn from the past and not repeat any mistakes. And that's certainly foundational to our share repurchase program. Neil Mehta : Makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys. Travis Stice : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Betty Jiang of Barclays. Your line is now open. Betty Jiang : Good morning. So I was wondering if you guys can talk a bit more about the opportunities with the surface acreage and the water being a provider water in the Permian. I mean, these are recurring revenue streams that's clearly getting a fairly high multiple in the market. So what does it take for you to capture these type of new revenue streams? And how meaningful could it be? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Betty, I think there's a lot of land out here in West Texas, a lot of surface. We have about 65,000 acres in our portfolio. We also control a lot of molecules. So I think the mandate, as Travis mentioned earlier from our investors, is to stop selling your gas for zero and pay in full boat for power. And so we're going to find ways to benefit Diamondback shareholders by finding a new local market for our gas, but also insulating part of our business from what we believe to be an increasing power price in Texas over the next 10 years. So if we can cut off that cycle and benefit Diamondback shareholders, we're going to do it. I think the message we kind of put out there is that West Texas, has a lot of land, a lot of surface. It has a lot of gas that's, being sold for less than it should. It's got a lot of water production with that oil production that we have in the basin. And I think that results in a very cheap way to develop power. And the data center operators have not been focused on the Permian yet. There's certainly some conversations that are happening, and we're kind of putting the flag out there that this is a very cheap way to execute their business model while benefiting Diamondback shareholders. So more to come on that we're getting started, but we put a little teaser in the presentation this quarter. Betty Jiang : Yes, no, I appreciate that. Maybe my follow up is just how you're thinking about funding these type of investments, whether it be a JV partner with an infrastructure provider, infrastructure sponsor, or -- yes, because the gas power plants are pretty capital intensive to build. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. Listen, I think you'd expect us to do similar things to what we've done in the past. Right. Our first wave of equity method investments, which created a lot of value for our shareholders, was based on midstream and pipelines being out of the basin. And we think this can be a similar route. I think it's still early, but I think you'd expect us to lean on the experts as our partners. I think we provide a lot of expertise in how to navigate the basin and navigate the rock, and we'll let our partners on the power side handle their portion of the business. Betty Jiang : Makes sense. Thank you for that. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Betty. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCurdy of Pickering Energy Partners. Your line is now open. Kevin McCurdy : Hey, good morning. First, congratulations on closing the deal. I know you've been working on that for a long time. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Kevin. Kevin McCurdy : In your shareholder letter, you highlight the two big operational changes of using clear Fluids and drilling and using simul-fracs for completions of oil wells. I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit. Were those Fang practices that you're bringing to Endeavor acreage and do you have a rough estimate of what percentage of your wells use those techniques in 2024? Travis Stice : Yes. Well, for the Diamondback side, all of the wells we drilled and completed in 2024 were using clear fluid. And as of the fourth quarter today, all the rigs that were running are using clear fluid drilling system. And yes, that's a definite and know bring over from the Diamondback side. Simul-frac all of the wells we completed on a standalone basis. Besides the occasional spot crew in 2024, we're using simul-frac. And as of today, on a pro forma company, we're using all simul-frac operations. Four rigs or four crews and three of those are electric. Kevin McCurdy : Great. Thanks for the detail. That's all for me. Travis Stice : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Freeman of Raymond James. Your line is now open. John Freeman : Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Hey, John. John Freeman : The first question I had just when we sort of think about like long-term, about trying to improve the realized gas price in the Permian. I believe in the past we all have done acquisitions. A lot of those came with marketing contracts. You all kind of had to wait for those to roll off before you had control. I believe Endeavor didn't really have any kind of binding marketing contracts. If you sort of think about just the big benefit you're going to now get with just the dramatically bigger scale, maybe ability to kind of get space on future pipe, etcetera, maybe just how you can talk to abilities to kind of leverage that scale to improve pricing? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, good question, John. We do have certainly some flexibility, particularly on the residue gas, natural gas side as well as the crude side. You've seen us make some moves already on the crude side with a little bit of an increased commitment to the EPIC pipeline as well as, increased ownership. So, that fits with our prior strategy of driving value through midstream but protecting ourselves commercially. I think on the gas side we've got a good amount of space on a combination of Whistler and Matterhorns. We have about 250 million a day of space on those pipes. Those were decisions made a couple years ago. We expect to have a good amount of space, about 10% of the pipe on Blackcomb, which is the next pipe from the Whitewater crew that's coming out in a couple years. And that leaves some gas for other opportunities. Our friends at Energy Transfer who bought WTG, we're talking to them about some things about getting our gas out of the basin. And that, kind of leaves a little bit of gas for us to make some of these capital allocation decisions in the basin related to power, also related to our, Verde clean fuels investment. So we heard our investors loud and clear. It's time to stop selling gas at zero and diversify our risk. And that's what we're going to do, particularly as more and more gas gets produced in this basin. John Freeman : That's great. And then just my follow up question, in the prepared comments you'll talk about, point out sort of the opportunity to implement these kind of shared best practices, if you will, of the of the two companies and you're closely studying kind of various completion designs just in how does that kind of work in practice? Do you all just sort of start to, I guess quite frankly test these in the field or kind of what's the process for maybe implementing some of these changes to see if there is something that sort of has legs that you all could implement across the board? Travis Stice : Well, the first thing we did was we had over 650 office moves in the first six days post close onboarded 1,000 employees. And so we physically located a lot of the GGRE teams together. And then since the physical integration, we've started the team integration as well too, where teams are getting together, actually having conversations about, okay, here's what we were doing, here's what you were doing. Now let's try to figure out how we can put those things together in the best way to go forward. And I'm real proud of the organization that as I mentioned earlier, they've kind of just checked their egos at the door and we're really trying to learn, trying to learn the best from both sides. And obviously, some of the pace and requirements for a public company in the 90 day scorecards is a little different than working for a private company. But all things considered, I couldn't be more proud of the way the organization is responding to giving and receiving grace and trying to seek to understand as we put these synergies together and the synergies are going to be delivered as we put these teams together. And I think the scorecard that you've seen, we'll figure out a way to communicate some of these wins over time, but the big ones that we promised in February of this year, we've already delivered. And again, that's also a credit to the organization. John Freeman : Thanks, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Hey, thanks. Good morning. A lot of it's been hit, but I thought I'd come back on the productivity and efficiency side of things. Maybe just a quick look back for a look forward. But as you think about the improvements, both in terms of drilling speeds, drilling capabilities, lower drilling costs, and then a similar kind of approach on the frac side, how much of it do you think is, call it mechanical changes, meaning going to electric fracs or the higher spec drilling rigs relative to experience and learning curves, the crews themselves. The reason I'm asking is trying to think about if it's mostly mechanical that kind of runs its course, but if it's a combination of factors, then that would indicate we do have further to go in terms of more cost reductions. Kaes Van' t Hof : I think it's a combination, but it's also a mentality that when we see something mechanical that works, it gets implemented right away across the whole portfolio. It's not, hey, we think this works, let's talk about it next fall. If this works, let's do it now. And that's happened on both sides. On the Diamondback side, clearly on the simul-frac plus drilling fluids. And on the Endeavor side, some of their post completion work was really intriguing to us and we've put that into effect right away. So I would say also the consistency of the business model, not having to change the plan for every $10 move in oil price has allowed for large scale consistent development. With a lot of crews having worked for us for three or four years now on the Halliburton side and on the rig side, we have some preferred vendors that have worked with us for a long time. So I think there's certainly more to come. We're not going to give any of these efficiencies back and I think, on top of that, the completion design work that's going on between the two teams is what is probably most exciting to me personally eight weeks in on what can be done to improve well results going forward. Roger Read : That makes sense. And this probably comes back a little bit towards Bob's question earlier about what you would do if oil prices were to fall. We were to get an oversupply in 2025. When you think about the productivity and efficiency, it's clear know as we've heard from you and other companies, right. A consistent plan that, allows you to drill and complete wells and minimize, your non-productive time and all that. So as you think about making tweaks along the edge, giving up those productivity and efficiency trends could be, counterproductive to actually saving money in the very near term. What's the right way for us to think about how you'll weigh those decisions if they do, market does force that upon you next year. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Roger, I think it goes back to what Travis said about lessons learned. Right. And I think we have the size, scale and balance sheet to be able to withstand a cycle should it happen. I think the only thing that we would probably change is that at the low point of the cycle, you're going to be putting pipe in the ground cheaper than any point across that entire cycle. So I think we'd probably prefer to build more ducts than maybe in the past and have the balance sheet capacity to do so. But I think that would be the big change. The efficiencies on the frac side, we've proven we can stand up. We stood up two simul-frac crews just this quarter and they're running at KPIs that are similar to the rest of our crews within a pad. So I don't really buy into the losing efficiencies argument when you, when we're based in Midland, we know this basin as well as anybody and we've done this before. Travis Stice : Yes, Roger, that's, that's a cultural element that you'll see throughout Diamondback and that what I'm speaking to specifically is we don't ever seed ground once we've taken it. And that's not a function of the service companies. That's not their responsibility, our business partners on that side, it's our responsibilities as you know, supervising and leading those functions to bring back to the table the ground that we had taken so that it isn't lost. And that's a very, very important cultural element to maintaining our best in class execution and low cost operations. And I hope that makes sense, Roger. Roger Read : It does. I appreciate the clarity. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Travis Stice : Good morning. Paul Cheng : [Indiscernible] and the team. When you put the two companies together initially you're coming up with a synergy target but that's basically saying that okay -- the D&C cost is higher than you so you can bring it down. But of course indeed also probably doing something better than you guys as you think that you not going to have the big ego. So over the past three months, can you identify a couple of the biggest maybe that what you found that they have done substantially better than you. And can you quantify that? What is the potential saving from those? Travis Stice : Yes, I'll let Kaes talk about the specific savings. But we're eight weeks into this and we had our operations review a couple of weeks ago and we're immediately seeing some of the benefits of the Endeavor experience on drill outs, particularly where they've got a better drill out. It costs a little bit more money, but it's done quicker. And then the other one is on completion design. Yes. Kaes Van' t Hof : Combined to combine look at completion designs. Right. So, we've looked across the fence line and what Endeavor was doing for the last five years and then vice versa. And think about it, now we get to answer the questions that could not be answered a couple years ago. Right. So if they're drilling better, in 2022, they were drilling better. Joe Mill Middle Spraberry wells in U.S. and we had a big study on, hey, what's Endeavor doing? And I'm sure, they did similar things looking it up. So again, it goes back to that comment that Travis put in his letter. You can't model those benefits in an Excel spreadsheet, but I can guarantee you that there will be long-term benefits to the amount of data that's being shared between the two companies. And that, is kind of the holy grail of better combined well results. So better combined well results with the lowest cost structure is going to be a pretty impressive combination over the coming years. I think the other thing that we looked at, we have a huge production base, almost 600,000 gross barrels of oil a day. I think there's a lot of work to be done between the two teams on efficiencies and economies of scale on the production operations department. More to come on that that's probably slower to develop than D&C, which is front and center. But there's a lot of things coming our way. Travis Stice : And Paul, if you step back from it, it's hard to imagine any company, any single company that has more basin expertise than the pro forma company in Diamondback and Endeavor. And that's what we're seeing is we're seeing these basin experts come together collaboratively and come up with a better, a better solution to the problems. And those better solutions are, always underpinned by execution and cost. And so as Kaes just alluded to, it may be hard to articulate today, but you're going to see it over time as we continue to, to pick up the quarters and dimes and nickels as we put these two companies together in the Basin experts are trying to solve the same problem. Paul Cheng : Thank you. The second question is that on the payout in the third quarter you did 78% and of course you've been saying about 50% on the free cash flow. If we're looking out over the next couple quarters and if the share price stays relatively close to where we are, how you balance between your desire to quickly get down to 10 billion net debt and payout ratio? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, Paul, good question. I think I'll pick the second part first. I think if we're at this, in this kind of stock price environment, you're probably sticking to 50% of free cash, getting returns. And then when you go back to the third quarter, we had a couple things that impacted free cash flow for the quarter. One, we only had Endeavor count for 20 days out of the quarter. So even though the effective date of the deal was January 1st, the public numbers only account for 20 days or 21 days of Endeavor. So really the combined free cash flow of the business was a lot higher than that. But second, the Stevens family decided to sell down some of their shares post close. And we been pretty vocal with our shareholders that those are opportunities for us to commit to a large buyback at one time. And that's what we did with 2 million shares repurchased at one time. So I think that's more the exception than the norm here in this price environment. But that's why we have a strong balance sheet to be flexible, to do things like that, to do things like the TRP trade and still be on our way to 10 billion in net debt very, very quickly. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Can I slick a quick follow up? Kaes Van' t Hof : Sure. Paul Cheng : Any idea what's their family intention about their share? They sold 14.4. Are they done or that you think they -- did they indicate that what's their intention? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I don't have an answer to that, Paul, but I do know that we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity to participate and support our public shareholders on a consistent basis. I think the only thing that we've said publicly about the Stevens family stockholders is that over time they'd like to get down to where they're voting rights equal their ownership, which is, 25% of the of the business from about, 35% today. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Meade of Johnson Rice. Your line is now open. Charles Meade : Good morning, Travis, Kaes and Danny. I just have one question and I don't think it's been covered. You've covered a lot in your Q&A here, but it's really on OpEx. And I noticed that you've moved down the midpoints of your unit guidance, I think it was $0.10 on LOE and $0.20 on GP&T. And I'm wondering if you could give some maybe kind of portion that up. How much of that is maybe the Diamondback legacy assets doing better? How much of it is actually the contribution from the Endeavor asset base? In that case, it would suggest that the Endeavor assets are lower cost than Legacy Diamondback. Or also maybe it's just early realization of OpEx synergies. And if you give us a sense for that? And then Travis, going back to a point you made in your shareholder letter, you guys are still really, I guess, really optimizing, really analyzing and optimizing for 2025. And if your cost basis has already gotten better for 4Q, what does that suggest for 2025 in your mind? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I'll take the OpEx question first. I think, some things have moved down as a result of combination. I think we're going to be pretty conservative on guiding OpEx, only having 20 days of a combined business. So we're going to do a lot of work refining that over the next three months. I'm confident that we'll find some things that combined will come down on the LOE side. I would say the big difference between Diamondback's cost structure and Endeavors on LOE is that Diamondback sold our water business. So we're paying a third party fee for water disposal and handling versus Endeavor, consolidating that internally. So that's a $0.50, $0.60 delta per BOE by our estimation. That's going to help us combine. On the G&A side, we have a lot more BOEs and not a lot more G&A. So I'd expect that to come down a little bit. But all these things I think we'll get to refine here with Q4 reporting as we see three months of the combined business. And on 2025, Charles, I think we kind of hammered that point that well costs today are at the low end of our prior range. In some cases we're even below that. So what we need to do is focus on a plan that maximizes free cash flow, produces a lot of oil and has a very, very low breakeven. So that work's ongoing. I think things like the TRP trade getting worked into the plan are going to be free cash flow accretive to our stockholders. Charles Meade : Thanks for that detail Kaes. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Charles. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani of ROTH. Your line is now open. Leo Mariani : Hi, just wanted to ask a little bit more on 2025. I know it's not official guidance and still the outlook, but just kind of looking at where you are, for fourth quarter on production at 840 to 850 and you're basically saying we're reaffirming 800 to 825 for next year. Kind of feels like maybe that's a little conservative. I think maybe gas has been outperforming a bit here. And then also just on 2025, I think the pro forma plan has always been to be sort of flattish on oil per the macro. That kind of makes sense, but certainly sounds like you guys would be willing to kind of let that decline on your end. So just wanted to kind of verify that as if it is a bad macro. Do you see kind of a small decline and a pullback or would you be willing to have a more meaningful decline if oil prices are a disaster next year? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, listen, our base case is still hit 480,000 barrels of oil a day. We got it. Q4 to 470 to 475,000 barrels of oil a day. So base case still hits 480 next year for low fours of CapEx. I think the macro is going to dictate the decision closer to January on what ends up happening. But and your comment about the BOEs. Yes, you're probably right. We're very conservative on the BOE number. I think you can certainly assume closer to 840 to 850 BOEs versus that 800 to 825. At the end of the day, the oil drives the decision here. So we're very, very focused on oil guidance. But BOEs probably will end up being closer to 850 versus that 800, 825. Leo Mariani : Okay then just on the tax side, I wanted to see if there's any incremental cash tax benefit at all from Endeavor. I mean, your cash taxes came in, I think below what you guys guided to in 3Q. I know it was only 21 days or so of Endeavor, but do you expect any kind of incremental benefit at all there or is it going to be roughly kind of the same rate going forward? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes, I don't think it will be material. We'll still be in the kind of high teens, mid to high teens cash tax rate. Leo Mariani : Okay, thank you. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thanks, Leo. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Scott Gruber : Yes, Good morning. I wanted to come back to being flexible with the 2025 plan. A lot of questions on the how, but I didn't hear about when unless I missed it. But just given your low breakeven, at what oil price do you think about shifting out of maintenance mode? When do you start turning the dial? Kaes Van' t Hof : Well, high level, we're really not in maintenance mode. We're at 470 to 475 oil today we got it at 480 next year. Well, that's 2% growth. It is something. That's kind of the first goalpost. I think the key point is not necessarily how or when. It's that Diamondback is cognizant of this new business model and cognizant of the macro. And if we're not, we're not doing our jobs. So I think being cautious when things are when oil is in the high 60s and you have pockets of geopolitical premium coming in and out is a prudent thing to do. So at the end of the day, the lowest cost operator should be producing the last barrel in the basin. But I think that spreadsheet math is what's gotten this industry in trouble in the past and feels like we're getting ourselves in trouble again. So I think, again, I can't hammer enough that free, free cash flow trumps CapEx at Diamondback these days. Scott Gruber : Got it. I appreciate it. And then a quick one on just the trends you're seeing in the marketplace. It's really nice to see you guys in at $600 a foot. So quickly, -- and you mentioned some additional deal synergy case caps. But curious because we have a background here of deflation and service costs and tangible item costs. So just how much of that kind of background deflation is baked into that $600 number? Or could that number still continue to trend down above and beyond any additional efficiency and deal synergy caps just from deflation. If you mark-to-market your service contracts today kind of where do you think you could see that $600 number go? Kaes Van' t Hof : I mean we're pretty mark-to-market. That $600 is a real-time number. Certainly, there are wells that are below that number, but we're adding more Wolfcamp D to the plan. That's a more expensive well to drill. There's a couple of Barnett Woodford wells throughout the portfolio. I think in general, the core Wolfberry development is probably below that. Longer laterals also helped us. But that's a pretty real-time look. We don't -- as Danny mentioned earlier, we don't have a lot of long-term contracts. We recontract a lot. We get a lot of market intelligence on the service cost side. And I'd say above that, Scott, I don't see a rig count that's going up in the Permian over the next quarter or so. And so that should continue to delay prices, which should accrue to our shareholders' benefits. Scott Gruber : Thank you. Good color Kaes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kalei Akamine of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Kalei Akamine : Hey good morning guys. Thanks for getting me on. I want to take another shot at 2025 CapEx. First, on the $600 per foot, it's a solid update. And I think it shows the talent of your team to drive that low number even lower. But wondering if you can help ground us. So I'm looking for a couple of pieces. First, can you remind us what's in the original 2025 guide? And then talk about the non-B&C piece embedded in that guide. Do you see any one-off spending to bring the endeavor assets up to your standards? And then whatever that piece is, does that roll in 2026? Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean listen, I'll answer it again. I think $625 was kind of our assumed well cost for 2025. Now we're at $600. There are some wells below that. So we'll see what happens over the next couple of months. I'm confident in this team's ability to drive out costs, but we also like to guide fairly conservatively 15 months ahead of 2025 full year. So we like to keep all flexibility on our side. I'd say on the non-DC&E CapEx, the Endeavor assets are as good as ours above ground. I think there's some things probably $50 million, $60 million of environmental CapEx we got to spend next year, which is kind of onetime in nature. I think the combined infrastructure budget will probably be a little higher in 2025 than it will in 2026. We like to think that the infrastructure budget eventually moves closer to 6%, 7% of total capital. And Endeavor has a midstream business that has some CapEx that should we sell the midstream assets to our JV, that CapEx would be removed. So some moving parts. I think high level, the key drivers are heading in the right direction. And I think the combined acreage position should result in lower spend above ground over time than 2025. Kalei Akamine : Awesome. I appreciate the color. Second question is going to go to Deep Blue. Here, you're targeting maybe Endeavor drop in first half of 2025, it sounds like, in the first deal, you took back $500 million of cash, 30% equity. Kind of wondering about deal structure, what should we expect for the upcoming drop? Will it be all cash? Or do you take back even more equity. And then for the guys that don't follow that space, how does one think about the range of deal multiples and what are assets. Kaes Van' t Hof : Yes. I mean it's a lot of we'll see. I think our preference is cash and more cash to accelerate deleveraging targets. But we recognize we have a partnership with Deep Blue and they should recognize the same that we are going to work on this business to grow value together. And that doesn't mean -- that means we're not -- we've never been in the business of levering up a sub in exchange for cash at the parent. And so we'll be flexible. I think we've been flexible to date and that business has created a good amount of value already in a year. So a lot of work to do. I'd say that's less of a near-term objective than the drop down. We have a lot of people working very hard on the mineral drop-down, which is a very significant deal for both Diamondback and Viper. Kalei Akamine : And maybe just a third one, just on the royalties [Indiscernible]. It's a really big chunk when you think about the amount of EBITDA associated with that asset and 8 to 10x, you get to really big numbers real fast. Are you still thinking that could be one package? Or is there a scenario where you break it down into more bite-size pieces. Kaes Van' t Hof : I think our preference is to do most of it at once. I think Viper has a lot of strategic objectives that we'll talk about in about an hour on its call, but I think getting the drop down behind us and showing the size and scale of that business on a combined basis is going to be important to future opportunities at Viper. I think it's amazing Viper today has an interest in 11,000 horizontal wells across the basin. And that's an information advantage that I don't think can be replicated. So I think momentum is very strong at Viper. That's also good for Diamondback shareholders because our ownership value has gone up dramatically this year. But I think our preference get most, if not all, of it done, and be off to the races in 2025. Kalei Akamine : Great. Thanks, guys. Kaes Van' t Hof : Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer question. I would now like to turn it back to Travis Stice, CEO, for closing remarks. Travis Stice : Thanks again for everyone listening in today and for the good questions. If there's any follow-up questions that you have, just reach out with using the numbers provided. Thanks, and you all have a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",
